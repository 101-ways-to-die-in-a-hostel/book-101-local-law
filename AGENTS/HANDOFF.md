## Known Minor Issues (Not Addressed)

These were identified during revision but judged too minor to fix:

1. **Ch 40 elapsed-time calculations** — Approximate times in the 3 AM notification chapter are slightly off but not noticeable to readers.
2. **Ch 28/36 time zone calculation** — London/KL offset stated as 7 hours in one place, 8 in another. Actual offset is 8 hours (GMT+8 vs GMT+0). One instance slightly off.
3. **Felix's stay duration** — Ch 1 says "few weeks," Ch 2 says "two months." Left as-is; both are character perception, not narrator fact.

## No Blocking Issues

No half-written chapters. No placeholder content. No unresolved continuity errors. The manuscript is ready for human review.
