## Confirmed Inconsistencies

### 1. PART 2 TIMELINE COMPRESSION (Chapters 15-20)

**Severity: MAJOR**

- **Chapter 15** (line 1): "Connor had been at this for three weeks and two days." Context makes clear "at this" means the upgraded delivery schedule, which began Day 16 (the day after Felix's pitch on Day 15). Three weeks and two days from Day 16 = Day 39.
- **Chapter 15** (line 9): "RM6,400 in three weeks" at RM2,000/week confirms approximately 3 weeks of upgraded deliveries, consistent with ~Day 38-39.
- **Chapter 20** (line 5): "The burner phone buzzed at 8:47 AM on Day 39."

**The problem:** Both Chapter 15 and Chapter 20 are set at approximately Day 38-39. This means Chapters 16, 17, 18, and 19 (four full chapters, nominally 20,000-24,000 words) must all fit within a single day or at most two days. This is a severe timeline compression that undermines the sense of escalation across Part 2.

**Expected:** Chapter 15, as the midpoint of Part 2, should fall around Day 25-30, allowing the remaining chapters to cover Days 30-39 at a more measured pace.

---

### 2. SUITCASE BRAND CONTRADICTION (Chapter 30 vs. Chapter 41)

**Severity: MODERATE**

- **Chapter 30** (line 225): "The suitcase was on the bed. Black. Hard-shell. Mid-size." No brand is named. The suitcase is described only through its physical properties (black, hard-shell, mid-size) and through its generic anonymity: "the suitcase that looked like every other suitcase."
- **Chapter 41** (line 18): The police report describes "a black hardshell suitcase (brand: Samsonite, model: Lite-Shock)."

**The problem:** Chapter 30 presents the suitcase as deliberately anonymous and generic -- "the suitcase that looked like every other suitcase." Samsonite Lite-Shock is a recognisable premium brand (retailing at RM800-1500+), which contradicts the impression of a cheap, unremarkable bag. A trafficking operation would be more likely to use an anonymous, low-cost suitcase as described in Chapter 30 than a branded Samsonite. Additionally, the Samsonite Lite-Shock is known for being extremely lightweight (under 2kg), but Chapter 30 says the suitcase shell alone weighs approximately 10kg minus the clothes and drugs -- suggesting a much heavier, cheaper product.

---

### 3. BUS COMPANY CONTRADICTION (Chapter 31 vs. Chapter 41)

**Severity: MODERATE**

- **Chapter 31** (lines 21-49): The bus is identified repeatedly and consistently as "Transnasional service 1087" -- mentioned in the bay listing, the bus livery ("the Transnasional logo on the side"), the Malay-language announcement, and the English translation. The bus is described as "a Scania, white with blue stripes."
- **Chapter 41** (line 18): The police report identifies the bus as "Konsortium Bas Ekspres service number KBE-2247."

**The problem:** These are two different bus companies with different service numbers. Transnasional and Konsortium Bas Ekspres are both real Malaysian bus operators, and they are not the same company. The police report should match the bus Connor actually boarded.

---

### 4. ARREST TIME DISCREPANCY (Chapter 31 vs. Chapter 41)

**Severity: MODERATE**

- **Chapter 31** (line 113): "At eleven twenty-two, the bus slowed" -- this is the first checkpoint. The bus passes through. Immediately after ("eight seconds" of relief), the bus slows again for the second checkpoint. The arrest occurs at the second checkpoint, which would be approximately 11:30-11:45 AM based on the narrative pacing.
- **Chapter 31** (line 93): The rest stop at Tapah is at "ten fifteen in the morning." The bus departs Tapah after 15 minutes (approximately 10:30 AM). The first checkpoint at 11:22 AM is consistent with this.
- **Chapter 41** (line 18): "The subject was arrested at 14:32 hours on February 13, 2026."

**The problem:** The narrative places the arrest at approximately 11:30-11:45 AM. The police report says 14:32 (2:32 PM). This is a discrepancy of approximately 3 hours. The checkpoint is described as being between KM 226 and KM 227 near Tapah, which is reached roughly 2.5-3 hours into a 5-hour KL-to-Penang journey -- consistent with the Chapter 31 timing of ~11:30 AM but not with the report's 14:32.

---

### 5. CHAPTER 40 TIME CALCULATION ERROR

**Severity: MODERATE**

- **Chapter 40** (line 91): "At 4:17 PM Malaysian time on Saturday -- fourteen hours after the body was found, twenty-six hours after the call to prayer, forty-eight hours after Connor Briggs walked out of the Lantern Hostel with a black suitcase."

**"Fourteen hours after the body was found"**: Body found at 02:17 AM Saturday. 02:17 + 14 hours = 4:17 PM Saturday. CORRECT.

**"Forty-eight hours after Connor walked out"**: Connor left the hostel at approximately 7:15-7:30 AM on Friday Feb 13 (Chapter 30, lines 259-265). From 7:15 AM Friday to 4:17 PM Saturday = approximately 33 hours. The text says 48 hours. INCORRECT -- off by approximately 15 hours. For the math to work, Connor would have had to leave the hostel around 4:17 PM on Thursday, which contradicts the narrative.

**"Twenty-six hours after the call to prayer"**: The most contextually relevant call to prayer is the Fajr call at 5:32 AM on Friday Feb 13 (the last one Connor heard at the hostel, per Chapter 30 line 161). From 5:32 AM Friday to 4:17 PM Saturday = approximately 34 hours 45 minutes. INCORRECT -- off by approximately 9 hours. Even using the Asr prayer heard in the cell (Chapter 32, ~4:00-4:30 PM Friday), the gap would be approximately 24 hours, not 26.

---

### 6. FAJR PRAYER TIME INCONSISTENCY (Multiple chapters vs. Chapter 41)

**Severity: MINOR**

- **Chapters 11, 21, 23, 27, 30, 32** consistently give the Fajr (morning) call to prayer as **5:32 AM**. This is stated explicitly at least six times across the novel:
  - Chapter 11 (line 359): "the call to prayer would come at 5:32"
  - Chapter 23 (line 19): "The call to prayer came at 5:32 from Masjid Jamek"
  - Chapter 27 (line 77): "The call to prayer came at 5:32"
  - Chapter 30 (line 161): "The call to prayer came at 5:32 AM"
  - Chapter 21 (line 111): "the call to prayer would come at 5:32"
  - Chapter 32 (line 333): "the call that entered the Lantern Hostel through the air well at 5:32 AM"
- **Chapter 41** (line 210): "The call to prayer from Masjid Jamek would come at 5:47 AM."

**The problem:** The Fajr prayer time shifts from 5:32 AM to 5:47 AM with no explanation. Kuala Lumpur is near the equator (3.1 degrees N latitude), so prayer times vary minimally across the year -- the difference between the earliest and latest Fajr in KL is roughly 15-20 minutes across the entire year. A 15-minute shift within a 47-day period (late December to mid-February) is at the extreme edge of plausibility but inconsistent with the novel's repeated insistence on 5:32 AM as a fixed, recurring detail. The 5:32 AM time functions as a motif throughout the book; the shift to 5:47 AM in Chapter 41 reads as an error rather than a deliberate change.

---

### 7. CHAPTER 44 INTERNAL TIMELINE CONTRADICTION

**Severity: MAJOR**

Chapter 44 contains multiple time references that contradict each other:

- **Line 9**: Connor arrived "forty-eight days ago." If Day 1 was Connor's arrival, this places Priya's return at Day 49 -- approximately Feb 16, just 2 days after Connor's death.
- **Line 17**: "the chain was forty-eight days long" -- reiterates the 48-day figure.
- **Line 23**: Connor's customs process was "forty-eight days ago" -- stated a third time.
- **Line 5**: Priya first arrived "six weeks ago" -- 42 days. Priya was at the hostel before Connor (she was "two days into her own stay" when he arrived), so "six weeks ago" from Priya's return puts her return at approximately Day 44-45 from her perspective, or Day 42-43 from Connor's arrival. This contradicts the "forty-eight days" figure.
- **Line 45**: The bell sound "six weeks ago when she had entered for the first time" -- again 42 days, consistent with 6 weeks but not with 48 days.
- **Line 303**: The jade bracelet was bought "five weeks ago." Connor bought the bracelet during the crisis period, approximately Days 39-45. Five weeks = 35 days. If the bracelet was bought around Day 42, then 35 days later = Day 77, placing Priya's return around late March.
- **Line 25**: "The heat of KL in February" -- explicitly states the month is February, consistent with 48 days since arrival (Day 49 in mid-February) but not with the "five weeks since bracelet" timeline that points to late March.

**The core contradiction:** The "forty-eight days" figure (used three times) places Priya's return 2 days after the death, but the chapter describes events that require weeks to have elapsed: Ahmad's investigation is well advanced, evidence has been compiled, formal meetings are arranged at the High Commission, and Priya references "weeks since the phone call" about Connor's death. The "five weeks since bracelet" reference supports a late-March return (approximately Day 77), which would be consistent with the investigation's described progress. The "forty-eight days" figure appears to be an error -- likely the author confused "forty-eight days since arrival" with a larger number that accounts for the aftermath period.

---

### 8. MEI LING'S TIME ZONE CALCULATION (Chapter 28)

**Severity: MINOR**

- **Chapter 28** (line 271): Mei Ling calculates Priya's arrival: "She lands in London at -- six AM tomorrow, London time. One PM our time."
- London in February is on GMT (UTC+0). Malaysia is UTC+8. Therefore 6:00 AM London time = 2:00 PM Malaysian time (6 + 8 = 14:00), **not** 1:00 PM.
- **Chapter 36** (line 3): "At 1:07 PM Malaysian time...AirAsia flight D7 2 touched down at London Heathrow." This matches Mei Ling's (incorrect) calculation but not the actual time zone math.

**The problem:** Either Mei Ling's calculation is wrong by 1 hour and the flight arrival in Chapter 36 is also wrong (matching the error), or the author intended the time difference to be 7 hours (which it is not -- the UK-Malaysia difference is always 7 or 8 hours depending on BST/GMT, and in February it is 8 hours). If the flight arrives at 1:07 PM Malaysian time, that would be 5:07 AM London time, not 6:00 AM. The error propagates: Mei Ling tells Razak they have "until tomorrow afternoon" to act, and Razak bases his timeline on 1 PM. If the correct arrival is 2 PM, the characters' sense of urgency is slightly miscalibrated.

---

### 9. CHAPTER 41 DATE: "SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15TH" DAY-OF-WEEK VERIFICATION

**Severity: REQUIRES VERIFICATION**

- **Chapter 41** (line 5): "The police report was filed at 9:47 AM on Saturday, February 15th."
- If Day 1 is approximately December 29, 2025 (Monday), then Day 47 = February 13, 2026 (Friday). February 14 = Saturday. February 15 = **Sunday**, not Saturday.
- However, if Day 1 is December 28, 2025 (Sunday), then Day 47 = February 12 (Thursday), which doesn't match "Friday" references in Chapters 36 and 40.
- If Day 1 is December 30, 2025 (Tuesday), then Day 47 = February 14 (Saturday), Feb 15 = Sunday. Still doesn't make Feb 15 a Saturday.
- If Day 1 is December 31, 2025 (Wednesday), then Day 47 = February 15 (Sunday). Not Friday.

**The problem:** Chapter 40 references the day of the death/aftermath as "Saturday" and "Friday night." Chapter 41's police report dates the incident as "February 14, 2026" and says the report was filed on "Saturday, February 15th." In 2026, February 14 is a Saturday and February 15 is a Sunday. If the death occurs on the night of Friday Feb 13 / early Saturday Feb 14, and the report is filed the next day, the filing date would be Saturday Feb 14 or Sunday Feb 15. The text says "Saturday, February 15th" but February 15, 2026 is a Sunday. Either the date or the day-of-week is wrong.

**Note:** The article in the same chapter says it appeared in "the Saturday edition of The Star" and describes the death as having occurred "early yesterday morning," which is consistent with a Saturday publication about a Friday-night/early-Saturday death. But if the report is filed on the same Saturday the article appears, the date should be February 14, not February 15.

## Items Reviewed and Found Consistent

The following timeline references were checked and found to be internally consistent:

- **Day 1 (Chapter 1):** Connor's arrival, check-in, meeting Felix. No date conflicts.
- **Day 6 (Chapter 6):** "Day six in Malaysia" -- first delivery. Consistent with Day 1 arrival.
- **Day 15 (Chapter 10-11):** Felix's pitch on the rooftop at 6 AM. Seamless transition between chapters. Consistent with "first week" panic having receded (Chapter 10).
- **Day 39 (Chapter 20-21):** Felix reveals truth. Chapter 21 continues same evening. Consistent.
- **Day 41 (Chapter 23):** "forty-one days" in the hostel; "rooftop two nights ago" = Day 39 + 2. Consistent.
- **Day 46 (Chapter 28-30):** Priya's departure, Connor collects suitcase. Consistent within these chapters.
- **Day 47 morning (Chapter 30-31):** 5:32 AM call to prayer, 7:00 AM suitcase pickup, 7:15 Grab, 7:42 at TBS, 8:00 bus departs, 10:15 Tapah rest stop. Internally consistent sequence.
- **Chapter 36 internal sequence:** 1:07 PM arrival, 2:15 PM email opened, 3:30 PM Razak calls, 10:00 PM guard round, 10:47 PM bribe message, 11:15 PM guard leaves. Consistent chronological sequence.
- **Chapter 37:** Murder occurs after 11:15 PM on the night of Day 47 / early Feb 14. Consistent with body found at 02:17 AM.
- **Chapter 40 Tuesday call:** Parents receive call "the following Tuesday at 3 AM Melbourne time" -- Karen waits for Sunday call, then Tuesday arrives. This is Feb 17 (Tuesday), three days after the death. Consistent with plausible embassy processing delay.
- **Chapter 50:** "Three months after Connor Briggs died" -- approximately May 2026. Consistent with aftermath timeline.
- **Passport number PA7834521:** Consistent across Chapters 15, 32 (twice), and 41.

## Recommendations for Revision

1. **Chapter 15:** Change "three weeks and two days" to a shorter period (e.g., "ten days" or "a week and a half") to place Chapter 15 around Day 25-27 rather than Day 39.
2. **Chapter 41 police report:** Change "Samsonite, model: Lite-Shock" to an unbranded or generic suitcase to match Chapter 30's description. Change "Konsortium Bas Ekspres service number KBE-2247" to "Transnasional service 1087" to match Chapter 31.
3. **Chapter 41 police report:** Change arrest time from "14:32 hours" to approximately "11:45 hours" to match the Chapter 31 narrative.
4. **Chapter 40:** Recalculate the triple time reference. Correct values should be approximately: "fourteen hours after the body was found" (correct, keep), "thirty-five hours after the call to prayer" (if referencing 5:32 AM Fajr on Friday), "thirty-three hours after Connor walked out of the Lantern Hostel" (if he left at ~7:15 AM Friday).
5. **Chapter 41:** Change the Fajr prayer time from "5:47 AM" to "5:32 AM" to match the established motif.
6. **Chapter 44:** Replace all three instances of "forty-eight days" with a figure consistent with a late-March return (approximately "twelve weeks" or "eighty-something days"). Alternatively, keep "forty-eight days" and remove the "five weeks ago" bracelet reference and the "six weeks ago" first-visit reference, adjusting them to shorter periods. The "February" month reference on line 25 would also need to change to "March" if the longer timeline is used.
7. **Chapter 28 / Chapter 36:** Either change Mei Ling's calculation from "One PM our time" to "Two PM our time" and adjust the Chapter 36 arrival to "2:07 PM" (or similar), or change "six AM London time" to "five AM London time" to make 1 PM MYT correct.
8. **Chapter 41:** Resolve the February 15 day-of-week issue. If the death is early Saturday Feb 14, the report filed "the next day" should be either Saturday Feb 14 (same day) or Sunday Feb 15. Change "Saturday, February 15th" to either "Saturday, February 14th" or "Sunday, February 15th."
