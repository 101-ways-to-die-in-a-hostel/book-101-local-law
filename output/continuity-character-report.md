## CRITICAL ERRORS

### 1. Connor's Bed 7: Bottom Bunk vs. Upper Bunk

- **Chapter 1, line 162:** "Bed 7 was a bottom bunk, second from the back, against the right wall."
- **Chapter 2, line 329:** "Connor climbed into Bed 7 -- upper bunk, against the wall, the one with the mattress that was thin enough to feel the wooden slats through the foam."

In Chapter 1, Bed 7 is clearly described as a **bottom bunk**. Connor lies back and stares at "the slats above him" (the bunk above), which is consistent with a bottom bunk. But in Chapter 2, it is called an **upper bunk**. Chapter 4 (line 319) describes the "underside of the bunk above him" with stickers, again suggesting a bottom bunk.

Later chapters are ambiguous. Chapter 26 references a photo "taken from above -- from the upper bunk, or from a standing position beside the bed," which implies someone was above Connor's bed, consistent with a bottom bunk. Chapter 39 (line 272) references the bed frame rail "of the lower bunk" where Lena's name is carved, and a person "lying in the bed might see it" -- this also implies Bed 7 is a bottom/lower bunk.

**Verdict:** Chapter 2 erroneously calls Bed 7 an "upper bunk." All other chapters treat it as a bottom bunk.

**Fix:** Change "upper bunk" to "bottom bunk" in Chapter 2, line 329.

### 2. Tomoko's Camera: Canon R5 vs. Nikon D850

- **Chapter 4, line 273:** "The Canon R5's SD card held 847 images..."
- **Chapter 14, line 205:** "Camera in hand -- the professional Nikon she carried everywhere..."
- **Chapter 16, line 177:** "the Nikon D850 was missing from its case."
- **Chapter 17, line 235:** After the theft, she gets "a Fujifilm compact that looked like a downgrade from the Nikon."

Tomoko's camera is introduced as a **Canon R5** in Chapter 4 but is consistently called a **Nikon D850** from Chapter 14 onward. The Nikon designation is used in Chapters 14, 16, and 17.

**Verdict:** Two different camera brands/models. The majority of references say Nikon D850. Chapter 4's "Canon R5" is the outlier.

**Fix:** Change "Canon R5" to "Nikon D850" in Chapter 4, line 273.

---

### 3. Priya's Parents: Three Contradictory Versions

Priya's parents are described differently in three separate chapters:

**Version A -- Chapter 5, line 205 (Batu Caves scene):**
- Parents are "in Leicester"
- Father "ran a pharmacy"
- Mother "had wanted to be a doctor but married at nineteen instead and had channelled that thwarted ambition into Priya"

**Version B -- Chapter 22, line 109 (Felix's threat):**
- Father is "a cardiologist at St Thomas'"
- Mother "runs a GP practice in Wembley"
- Brother Arjun is "applying to read law at UCL"

**Version C -- Chapter 27, line 105 (Connor and Priya's last day together):**
- Parents are "in Ealing"
- Father "drove a black cab"
- Mother "taught primary school and made the best dhal in West London"

**Chapter 36, line 42** says she'll "call her parents in Ealing" (consistent with Version C).

**Chapter 22, line 35** also mentions "her parents' divorce hearing," which contradicts all three versions where both parents appear to be together.

The canon (CHARACTERS.md) says only: "British-Indian (London, parents from Gujarat)." The canon (VICTIM_PROFILE.md) says: "Priya Sharma: The British-Indian medical student."

**Verdict:** This is the most severe continuity error in the manuscript. Three completely different family backgrounds for the same character. Version B (Chapter 22) is the most detailed and is delivered as Felix's intelligence dossier -- it carries the most narrative weight. However, it cannot coexist with Versions A or C.

**Fix:** Choose one version and revise the other two chapters. Version B (cardiologist father, GP mother, in Wembley/Ealing area) is the best candidate because: (a) it appears in the most dramatically important scene, (b) Felix's dossier must be accurate for the threat to work, and (c) it aligns with the Ealing/London setting used in Chapter 36. Revise Chapter 5 and Chapter 27 to match. Also resolve the "parents' divorce" reference in Chapter 22 -- either remove it or ensure the parents are indeed divorced.

---

### 4. Cell Number: "Cell 5" vs. "Cell C-7"

- **Chapters 36, 37, 38:** The cell is consistently called **"Cell 5"** (the fifth cell in the block, with Cells 1-4 described before it during guard rounds).
- **Chapters 32, 34, 39, 41, 43:** The cell is called **"Cell C-7"** in the official documentation, custody logs, and Ahmad's investigation.

Chapter 38 follows Hafiz walking past Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3, Cell 4, then arriving at Cell 5 -- a sequential physical layout. But the official report in Chapter 41 calls it "Holding Cell C-7, Ground Floor, Detention Wing." Chapter 32 (line 267) even draws attention to the number: "Bed 7. Cell 7. The numbers recurring with the pattern-recognition insistence of a motif."

**Verdict:** These are contradictory designations. If the cell is C-7, there should be at least 7 cells. But Hafiz walks past only 4 cells before reaching the death cell (Cell 5). Either the physical layout is wrong (there should be more cells), or the cell designation in the official report is wrong.

**Fix:** Align the cell designation. Either: (a) change the guard's walk-through in Chapter 38 so that the cell is actually the seventh in the block (adding Cells 6 and possibly adjusting the layout), or (b) change "Cell C-7" to "Cell 5" in the official documents. Option (a) preserves the thematic "7" motif.

### 5. Time of Death / Discovery: Multiple Conflicting Times

| Detail | Chapter 38 | Chapter 39 (custody log) | Chapter 41 (official report) | Chapter 43 (Ahmad's investigation) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Guard returns | ~00:02 (midnight) | 00:40 | 02:17 | 02:12 (Hafiz returns from toilet) |
| Body discovered | ~00:02 | 00:40 | 02:17 | -- |
| Declared dead | ~01:05 (Ch38 Dr. Rajan exam) | 01:05 | 02:34 | -- |
| Estimated TOD | 23:15-23:45 (Ch38 core temp) | -- | -- | -- |
| Hafiz bathroom break | ~22:00-00:02 | 23:55 to 00:40 (42 min) | -- | 01:32 to 02:12 (40 min) |

These times are severely inconsistent:
- Chapter 38 has the discovery near midnight (00:02 on his round).
- Chapter 39's custody log has it at 00:40.
- Chapter 41's official report says 02:17.
- Chapter 43 says Hafiz left at 01:32 and returned at 02:12.

**Verdict:** The timeline of the death is told from multiple perspectives, but the timestamps do not align. The official report (Ch41) and Ahmad's investigation (Ch43) are broadly consistent with each other (02:17 discovery), but contradict Chapter 38 (which shows Hafiz discovering the body much earlier, near midnight) and Chapter 39's custody log (00:40).

**Fix:** Align all timestamps. The Ch41/Ch43 timeline (Hafiz leaves ~01:32, returns ~02:12-02:17, declared dead ~02:34) appears to be the most internally consistent and should be the authoritative timeline. Chapters 38 and 39's custody log need revision.

---

### 6. Lena's Surname: Ekström vs. Johansson

- **Chapter 25, line 17:** "Lena Ekström. Twenty-two. Swedish."
- **Chapter 47, line 125:** "'Lena Johansson. Swedish. Twenty-two.'"

Two different surnames for the same character.

**Verdict:** Clear continuity error.

**Fix:** Choose one surname and correct the other instance.

---

### 7. Lena's Arrest Location

- **Canon (CHARACTERS.md):** "arrested carrying drugs to Thailand"
- **Chapter 25, line 17:** "Arrested carrying 200 grams of methamphetamine at the Thai-Malaysian border crossing at Bukit Kayu Hitam" (consistent with canon)
- **Chapter 29, line 199:** "arrested at a bus station in Butterworth, across the strait from Penang"
- **Chapter 47, line 125:** "Arrested at Butterworth, carrying for the Penang route"

Bukit Kayu Hitam (Thai border) and Butterworth (Penang, not at the Thai border) are approximately 130 km apart. Two chapters say Butterworth; one says Bukit Kayu Hitam.

**Verdict:** Contradictory arrest locations.

**Fix:** Choose one location. Butterworth (Chapters 29, 47) has majority usage.

---

### 8. Rizal's Charge: Assault (Section 323) vs. Affray (Section 159)

- **Chapter 39, line 85/111:** "Rizal bin Yusof, assault charge, Section 323 Penal Code"
- **Chapter 41, line 24:** "MOHD RIZAL BIN AHMAD...charge of affray (Section 159 of the Penal Code)"

Two different charges cited under two different Penal Code sections.

**Verdict:** Inconsistency in the cover charge used to place Rizal in the cell. Note that Rizal's name changes too (Rizal bin Yusof in Ch39 vs. Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad in Ch41/43), but this appears intentional -- the fake name on the custody log vs. his real identity discovered later by Ahmad. The charge discrepancy, however, is likely unintentional.

**Fix:** Align the charge. Use "affray (Section 159)" or "assault (Section 323)" consistently. Since Chapter 34 (Rizal's introduction) establishes a "bar fight" backstory, "assault" or "affray" could work; just pick one.

---

### 9. Rizal Placement Time in Cell

- **Chapter 39, line 85:** Rizal placed in cell at **16:15**
- **Chapter 41, line 24:** Rizal placed in cell at **21:45**

A five-and-a-half-hour discrepancy.

**Verdict:** The Ch41 time (21:45) contradicts Chapter 34, which shows Rizal arriving and having extensive conversations with Connor over many hours before the murder (which occurs late at night). If Rizal arrived at 21:45, that leaves very little time for the extended interaction described in Chapters 34-35. The 16:15 time in Ch39 better fits the narrative.

**Fix:** Change Ch41 to match Ch39's 16:15 placement time.

---

### 10. Date of Death in Newspaper: February 15 vs. February 14

- **Chapter 41 (official report):** "Date of Incident: February 14, 2026. Time of Discovery: 02:17 AM"
- **Chapter 46, line 27:** "found dead in a holding cell at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters on February 15"

Connor was found dead in the early hours of February 14 (02:17 AM). The newspaper article in Chapter 46 incorrectly says February 15.

**Verdict:** Factual error in the newspaper account.

**Fix:** Change "February 15" to "February 14" in Chapter 46, line 27.

---

## MODERATE ISSUES

### 11. Dorm Locations: Floor Assignments

**Canon:**
- Priya: "Dorm 4 (Female dorm), Second Floor"
- Tomoko: "Dorm 5, Third Floor"
- Jake: "Dorm 1, Second Floor"
- Connor: Dorm 3, Second Floor (per Ch1)

**Chapter 22, line 41:** "Third floor. The corridor was shorter up here -- two dorms, two private rooms, one bathroom... Dorm 4 was quiet. Dorm 5 was quiet. Tomoko was in there somewhere."

This places both Dorm 4 AND Dorm 5 on the third floor. The canon says Priya's Dorm 4 is on the second floor.

**Chapter 14, line 201:** "He passed the door to Dorm 4 -- Priya's dorm" (this is on the way upstairs to the third floor from the second floor, which could be either floor).

**Verdict:** Chapter 22 explicitly places Dorm 4 on the third floor, contradicting the canon. If both Dorm 4 and 5 are on the third floor, and the private rooms are also there, this works architecturally but contradicts the canon.

**Fix:** Either update the canon to place Dorm 4 on the third floor, or revise Chapter 22.

---

### 12. Hostel Layout: Felix's Stay Duration

- **Chapter 1, line 242:** Felix says he's been "at The Lantern? A few weeks. In KL? On and off for a year."
- **Chapter 2, line 47:** Connor thinks "Two months? In a hostel?" about Felix's stay.
- **Canon (CHARACTERS.md):** "Pays weekly" and the text says two months.

Chapter 1 says "a few weeks" but Chapter 2 treats it as "two months." These are slightly different (a few weeks = 3-4 weeks; two months = 8+ weeks).

**Verdict:** Minor inconsistency. Could be chalked up to imprecise language in Chapter 1 vs. more specific information emerging in Chapter 2, but it is a noticeable shift.

---

### 13. Connor's Age at Departure

- **Canon (VICTIM_PROFILE.md):** Connor is 27, dropped out of uni "four years ago."
- **Chapter 15, line 215:** "He'd been twenty-three" when he first left for Asia, and "his father had driven him to Tullamarine."

If Connor is 27 and left at 23, that's four years -- consistent.

**Verdict:** Consistent. No error.

---

- Speech pattern (precise English, soft German accent, uses people's names): Consistent throughout.
- Room (Private Room 1, Third Floor): Consistent across all chapters.

- Camera brand: **INCONSISTENT** (see Critical Error #2 above).

### Mama Siti
- Relationship to Nurul: Confirmed as niece in Ch30 (line 65) and Ch47 (line 205).
- Full name: "Siti binti Ahmad" (Ch47, line 205). Consistent.
- Role (oracle/cook): Consistent throughout.

### Mei Ling Chen
- Age (24): Described in Ch1 (line 114).
- Description (Malaysian-Chinese, sharp angles, ponytail, polo shirt): Consistent.

- Office (map with red pins, newspaper clippings, true crime books): Consistent in Ch9.
- Role (reluctant bystander, knows about network): Consistent.

### Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail
- Rank (Sergeant): Consistent throughout all chapters.
- Division (Narcotics, Dang Wangi): Consistent. Business card described in Ch15.
- Role: Canon says "the arresting officer at the highway checkpoint" -- but Ahmad does NOT make the highway arrest. He investigates afterward. In the chapters, he gives the street checkpoint warning (Ch15) and leads the post-death investigation (Ch39-43). The highway arrest is performed by unnamed officers.
- Description: Canon says "42, by-the-book, stern." Age not stated in text but not contradicted.

**Note on Ahmad's role:** The canon describes Ahmad as "The arresting officer at the highway checkpoint." The chapters do not depict Ahmad at the highway checkpoint -- the arrest is conducted by unnamed PDRM officers. Ahmad's first appearance is at the Bukit Bintang street checkpoint (Ch15), and his major role is the post-mortem investigation. This is a minor discrepancy between canon and execution, though the character's function (representing the law) is preserved.

### Hafiz
- Full name: Hafiz bin Mohd Noor (Ch43, line 43/127).
- Role (guard at Dang Wangi, complicit in death): Consistent.
- Age: 26 (Ch38, line 137 -- "twenty-six-year-old man").
- The canon document does not have a detailed entry for Hafiz.

### Rizal
- Canon says "Real name: Unknown. Appears: Chapters 39-40 only."
- Actual appearance: Rizal first appears in **Chapter 34** (his introduction chapter, titled "Chapter 34: Rizal"), continues through Chapters 35, 37, and 38. He does NOT appear only in Chapters 39-40.
- His fake name (Rizal bin Yusof) vs. real identity (Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad) is handled intentionally as a plot point.
- **His charge is inconsistent** (see Critical Error #8).
- Method (strangulation by towel in holding cell): Consistent with his role as described in canon.

## SUMMARY

| Severity | Count | Items |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Critical | 10 | Bed position, camera brand, Priya's parents (x3 versions), cell number, time of death, Lena's surname, Lena's arrest location, Rizal's charge, Rizal's cell placement time, death date in newspaper |
| Moderate | 2 | Dorm floor assignment, Felix's stay duration |
| Minor/Canon-only | 2 | Ahmad's role description in canon, Rizal's chapter appearances in canon |

**Most Urgent Fix:** Priya's parents (Critical Error #3). Three completely different family backgrounds across three chapters is the kind of inconsistency readers will catch immediately.

**Second Priority:** Cell number and death timeline (Critical Errors #4 and #5). The climax sequence is told from multiple perspectives and the timestamps and cell designations need to be unified.
