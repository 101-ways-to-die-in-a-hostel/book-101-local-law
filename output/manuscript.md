# Chapter 1: Arrival

The plane touched down at KLIA2 with the kind of graceless thud that only budget airlines could deliver, a gut-punch of rubber on tarmac that rattled the overhead bins and jolted awake every backpacker who'd passed out during the three-hour haul from Denpasar. Connor Briggs didn't flinch. He'd flown AirAsia enough times to know that the landing was less an arrival and more a controlled argument with the ground. Besides, he was busy. His phone was angled at the window, filming the blur of tropical green and grey runway sliding past, the afternoon light thick and golden, the kind of light that Instagram was built for.

"KL, baby," he murmured, already composing the caption. *New country, new chapter. No plans. No limits. Just vibes.* He'd workshop the hashtags later. He had a system: location tag first, then the aspirational ones -- #digitalnomad, #livingmybestlife, #noplannoworries -- and finally the bait for the algorithm, #malaysia #kualalumpur #backpackerlife. He knew what he was doing. Four years on the road, twelve countries, forty-two hundred followers. Well, forty-one-eighty-something, but you round up. Everyone rounds up.

The seatbelt sign dinged off and the cabin erupted into the usual Pavlovian scramble of people reaching for bags they'd spent three hours pressed against. Connor stayed seated. He'd learned this move in Bangkok, years ago: let the amateurs clog the aisle while you sit back, relaxed, visibly unbothered. It was a small performance, but performance was the point. He stretched his arms above his head, letting the hem of his singlet ride up over the flat, sun-browned plane of his stomach, and yawned like a man who had nowhere to be. Because he didn't. That was the whole thing. That was the life.

The woman in the middle seat -- Chinese, maybe, or Malaysian, Connor wasn't great with distinctions -- squeezed past him with an apologetic nod. He flashed her his best grin, the one that crinkled the corners of his eyes and made him look like a guy in a toothpaste ad, if the toothpaste ad took place in a Bali surf shack.

"No worries," he said, even though she hadn't said anything.

He waited until the aisle was nearly clear, then stood, pulled his battered Osprey pack from the overhead bin with practiced ease, and joined the slow shuffle toward the exit. The air shifted as he neared the door -- the seal of the cabin breaking, the first breath of outside pushing in. It was warm. Not Bali-warm, which was a dry, volcanic warmth that sat on your skin like powder. This was different. This was *wet*. The humidity hit him in the jetway like walking into someone's open mouth, a living heat that was part water, part engine exhaust, part something botanical and unnameable. His skin went slick in the time it took to walk thirty meters.

*Welcome to Malaysia*, he thought. *This'll do.*

Connor had no plan for Kuala Lumpur. This was by design. Plans were for amateurs -- for the gap-year kids with their colour-coded itineraries and their Lonely Planet guides bristling with Post-it flags, for the couples who booked everything three months in advance and then spent the whole trip anxious that reality wouldn't match the TripAdvisor photos. Connor didn't do that. Connor *flowed*. He arrived somewhere, found the cheapest hostel with decent reviews, and let the city tell him what to do. This approach had served him well across twelve countries and four years of what he called, with no irony whatsoever, *living deliberately*. It had also, on three separate occasions, left him sleeping in a bus station, but those were stories now. Content. The bus station in Vientiane was one of his most-liked posts.

The terminal at KLIA2 was a cathedral of budget travel -- high ceilings, wide corridors, the antiseptic gleam of a building designed to move millions of people who'd each paid forty dollars for the privilege. Connor moved through it with the loose-hipped confidence of a man who'd done this many times, which he had. He knew airports the way some people knew their local supermarket: the rhythms, the shortcuts, the unspoken rules. Find the signs for immigration. Join the shortest queue. Passport out, landing card ready, pen behind the ear. Smile at the officer. Don't joke. They never think you're funny.

He was filling out his landing card when the pen ran out, the cheap blue ink fading to nothing halfway through *Purpose of Visit*. He'd written *TOUR* in careful block capitals. He looked around for another pen, patting his shorts pockets with one hand. A Malay family in the queue behind him -- mother, father, two kids in school uniforms -- noticed his predicament. The father offered his pen without a word. Connor took it with a grin.

"Legend. Cheers, mate."

The father smiled politely. The mother pulled her children slightly closer. Connor didn't notice.

He breezed through immigration. The officer, a woman in a hijab with an expression of practised neutrality, stamped his passport without looking up. Ninety-day visa on arrival. The stamp was a little crooked. Connor photographed it for his stories, the navy blue of the Australian passport played artfully against his tanned hand and the faded compass tattoo on his inner forearm. He'd gotten the tattoo in Ubud -- a compass with no cardinal points, because, as he'd explained to approximately two hundred people, "I don't need directions, I just need momentum." It had cost him the equivalent of twelve dollars and three Bintang beers, and it was, he believed, the single most authentic thing about him.

He was still looking at his phone when he walked through the arrivals hall.

The sign was impossible to miss, which is why it was remarkable that Connor missed it. It hung above the corridor at eye level, backlit, in English and Bahasa Melayu, in letters the size of a man's hand. White text on red. The universal colour of warning, of stop, of *pay attention*:

**WARNING**
**DEATH FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNDER MALAYSIAN LAW**

Beneath it, in smaller text: *The Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 prescribes the MANDATORY DEATH PENALTY for trafficking in dangerous drugs. This includes possession above threshold amounts of heroin (15g), methamphetamine (50g), cannabis (200g), and other controlled substances.*

There was a graphic, too -- a stylised noose, rendered in the kind of stark, government-issue design that left nothing to interpretation. The sign was in four languages. It was flanked by Malaysian flags. It was, by any reasonable measure, the least subtle thing in an airport full of duty-free perfume advertisements and currency exchange signs.

Connor walked past it. His eyes were on his phone, his thumb scrolling through the notifications that had loaded now that he was connected to the terminal Wi-Fi. Seven Instagram likes. A comment from his mother: *Beautiful sunset! Stay safe darling xx*. A DM from a girl he'd met in Canggu asking if he was still in Bali. A WhatsApp message from Jake -- some American he'd been chatting with on a hostel forum -- saying *bro im at a sick hostel in KL petaling street area come thru*.

He thumbed a reply to Jake: *just landed bruh. On my way. Where u at?*

He did not look up. The sign hung above him for three full seconds, close enough that he could have reached up and touched the perspex casing, close enough that the red glow of the backlight fell briefly across the screen of his phone, colouring his mother's message the shade of arterial blood.

Then he was past it, and the sign was behind him, and it did not follow.

---

The KLIA Ekspres was the best thirty-five ringgit Connor didn't want to spend. He knew there were cheaper options -- a bus, probably, or one of those shared vans he'd seen in other Asian airports -- but his phone was at twelve percent and he needed to get to the city while he still had GPS. He didn't carry a power bank. He'd owned one, briefly, in Vietnam, but it had been heavy and he'd left it at a guesthouse in Hoi An and never replaced it. His position on power banks, which he'd articulated to several people who hadn't asked, was that they were a crutch. "If your phone dies, you just talk to people. That's how you *actually* travel."

This philosophy had a few cracks in practice, such as the time his phone died in rural Cambodia and he'd walked for two hours in the wrong direction on a road with no signage, but that was also a story now. Content.

The train was fast, clean, and air-conditioned to the point of violence. After the swamp-heat of the terminal, the carriage hit Connor like a refrigerator. He dropped into a window seat, pressed his forehead against the glass, and watched Malaysia unscroll.

The view from the Ekspres was a time-lapse of a country assembling itself. First: palm oil plantations, the trees in military rows, their fronds like green explosions frozen in mid-detonation. Then: industrial sprawl, warehouses with corrugated roofs, the skeletons of construction projects rising from red earth. Then, gradually, then all at once: the city. Kuala Lumpur emerged from the haze like a hallucination -- towers of glass and steel erupting from a canopy of tropical green, the skyline a jagged fever chart of ambition. And there, dead centre, unmistakable, ridiculous, magnificent: the Petronas Twin Towers, their tapered silver forms catching the late afternoon light and throwing it back in sheets of white fire.

Connor pressed record. His phone was at nine percent.

"Fully sick," he said to no one, panning across the skyline. The Petronas Towers filled the frame, then a golden mosque dome slid into view, then a cluster of palm trees, then a highway overpass, then a billboard for Milo in Bahasa Melayu. He held the shot until the towers disappeared behind a wall of apartment blocks, and then he stopped recording and checked the battery. Seven percent.

*She'll be right*, he thought. *Just need to get to the hostel and plug in.*

KL Sentral was a hive. Connor emerged from the Ekspres platform into a multi-level transit hub that thrummed -- escalators flowing in both directions, digital boards flickering with Malay text, the hum of a million commuters compressed into architecture, the smell of fried chicken from a KFC that seemed to exist in a pocket dimension between the LRT platforms. People moved with purpose. Connor moved with the carefully calibrated purposelessness of a man who wanted you to know he was in no rush.

He found the LRT almost by instinct. Years of navigating foreign transit systems had given him a sixth sense for the architecture of trains -- follow the signs, follow the flow of people with bags, and if all else fails, look lost near a security guard until they point you in the right direction. The LRT to Pasar Seni was two stops. He stood in the carriage, one hand on the overhead rail, his Osprey between his feet, and watched the city slide past the windows at a different speed now, closer, the buildings no longer a skyline but a street-level blur of signage and movement and life.

Pasar Seni station spat him out onto a covered walkway that led, in short order, to the edge of Petaling Street. And there, the city stopped being a postcard and became a body.

The heat was the first thing. Not the gentle warmth of the air-conditioned train or the filtered chill of the airport, but the full, unmediated assault of equatorial afternoon -- thirty-two degrees and eighty-something percent humidity, the air so thick with moisture that breathing felt like drinking. Connor's singlet adhered to his chest in the time it took to walk twenty steps. Sweat tracked down the channel of his spine. His flip-flops -- Havaianas, the only footwear he'd owned for two years -- slapped against wet pavement.

The second thing was the noise. Not noise, exactly -- noise suggested chaos. This was more like an orchestra tuning up, every instrument playing a different song. Cantonese shouted from a market stall to his left, a vendor holding up a fake Louis Vuitton bag and quoting a price in three currencies. Mandarin from somewhere behind him, rapid-fire, the tonal shifts like music. The sizzle and clatter of a wok from a hawker cart to his right, where a man in a stained apron was tossing flat noodles in a blackened pan, flames licking up around the edges. The roar of a motorbike splitting the pedestrian traffic. The tinny echo of Cantopop from a speaker balanced on a stack of shoeboxes. The distant, almost subliminal rumble of thunder, somewhere over the hills to the east, promising the afternoon storm that came every day like clockwork.

And the smell. Connor had been to markets in Bali and Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, and he'd thought he understood what a Southeast Asian street market smelled like. He was wrong, or at least incomplete. Petaling Street had its own olfactory signature, layered and complex: the char-sweet smoke of char kway teow frying, the waxy tang of incense drifting from a temple doorway, the diesel bite of a passing lorry, the vegetal funk of morning glory piled on a cart, and beneath it all, rising from the storm drains in the heat, a sulfurous note that wasn't exactly unpleasant but wasn't exactly pleasant either, the smell of a tropical city sweating through its infrastructure.

Connor raised his phone. Four percent. He filmed anyway. A slow pan across the market -- the canopy of blue and red tarpaulins stretched over the stalls, the riotous colour of fake designer goods hanging from every surface, the signs in Chinese and Malay and English all shouting at once, the faces of the crowd -- local and tourist, young and old, all moving through the narrow corridor of the market with the particular shuffle of people who are simultaneously going somewhere and going nowhere.

He narrated as he walked, his voice low and conspiratorial, the voice he used for his stories: "Day one in KL. No plan. No agenda. Just dropped into Chinatown and, like -- look at this. Look at this place. You can't plan this. You just have to let it happen." He turned the camera on himself, grinning, the market a kaleidoscopic blur behind him. "This is what travel is, guys. This right here. Hashtag no filter, hashtag no plan."

His phone died mid-selfie, the screen going black with the abruptness of a power cut. Connor stared at it for a moment, then laughed.

"Classic."

He needed directions. He had the hostel name -- The Lantern -- and a vague sense that it was somewhere on or near Petaling Street, which was where he was, which meant it couldn't be far. The backpacker logic was sound: hostels in Chinatown clustered together like barnacles on a hull. He just needed a vector.

He approached the nearest vendor, a middle-aged Chinese man surrounded by a fortress of phone cases and charger cables. The man was reading a newspaper folded into quarters, his reading glasses perched on the end of his nose.

"Hey, mate," Connor said. He did the thing he always did in countries where English wasn't the first language: he spoke louder and slower, as if volume and tempo were the same as translation. "Do. You. Know. The Lantern. Hostel? The. Lantern?"

The man looked up from his paper. He regarded Connor with an expression that contained, in its various layers, patience, amusement, and something that might have been pity.

"The Lantern?" the man said, in English that was not only perfect but faintly accented with the clipped precision of someone who'd studied in an English-medium school. "Yes. Go to the end of this row, turn left at the temple, walk fifty meters. It's between the phone repair shop and the Chinese medicine store. You'll see the red lanterns."

Connor blinked. "Oh. Cheers. Legend."

"You're welcome," the man said, and returned to his newspaper.

Connor walked. The vendor's directions were exact. At the end of the market row, a Chinese temple appeared on the corner -- red and gold, dragons on the roof, the sweet fog of joss sticks rolling from the open door. Connor turned left. The street narrowed. The market stalls thinned and gave way to shophouses -- old, beautiful, slightly decrepit, their facades decorated with plaster mouldings that might have been ornate once but were now softened by decades of humidity and neglect. The colours were pastels gone dark: mint green, faded coral, a yellow that had surrendered to ochre.

Fifty meters. And there it was.

---

The Lantern Hostel announced itself in the way that the best hostels always did -- not with a sign (though there was a sign, small and hand-painted, hanging from a bracket above the door) but with a feeling. A narrow entrance, squeezed between a phone repair shop on the left and a traditional Chinese medicine store on the right. The phone repair shop had a cluttered window display of cracked screens and coiled cables and a fluorescent light that buzzed with the resigned hum of a machine that had been on too long. The medicine store's window was darker, lined with jars of dried things -- roots, bark, something that might have been seahorses -- and a faded poster of an anatomical diagram with meridian lines drawn in red. Between these two businesses, a door. Not even a wide door -- Connor had to turn slightly sideways with his pack on. But above the door, and in the narrow hallway beyond it, and strung along the ceiling like a procession of small, soft fires: red paper lanterns.

They were beautiful. Connor would grant the place that before he'd even seen the reception desk. The lanterns hung at irregular intervals, their glow warm and amber, turning the narrow corridor into something that felt less like a hallway and more like a throat, leading down into the belly of an old building that had been breathing for nearly a century. The floor was tile -- patterned, cracked, original -- and the walls were close enough to touch on both sides. The air was different in here: cooler, tinged with the smell of damp wood and something herbal and sharp that Connor couldn't identify but which was, in fact, Tiger Balm.

He emerged from the corridor into a small reception area. A wooden counter, scarred and ancient, with a brass bell on it and a rack of pamphlets behind it -- tour operators, restaurant recommendations, a laminated sheet of LRT maps. A bookshelf against one wall, stuffed with the paperback detritus of a thousand travelers: dog-eared thrillers, Lonely Planet guides three editions out of date, a German-English dictionary, a copy of *Shantaram* so swollen with humidity it looked like it was trying to become a different book. A ceiling fan turned overhead with the languid dedication of something that had been turning for decades and would continue turning long after everyone in the room was dead.

Behind the counter, a young woman was looking at him with an expression that suggested she'd seen his exact type walk through this door approximately once a week for two years and had long since stopped being charmed.

"Hi," Connor said, deploying the grin. "I'm after a bed? Dorm, cheapest you've got."

Mei Ling Chen was twenty-four, Malaysian-Chinese, and constructed almost entirely of sharp angles -- cheekbones, elbows, the precise line of her ponytail, the geometric efficiency of her movements behind the counter. She wore a polo shirt with a small red lantern embroidered on the breast pocket, and she moved with the practiced economy of someone who had checked in enough backpackers to have reduced the entire process to its essential elements: look, assess, process, assign, forget.

"Passport," she said.

Connor handed it over. She opened it, glanced at the photo -- younger, cleaner, the ghost of a haircut -- and then at him, and then back at the photo, performing the comparison with the clinical detachment of a customs officer.

"Australian," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Melbourne." Connor leaned on the counter. "You been?"

"No." She placed the passport face-down on a small photocopier behind the counter, pressed a button, and returned it to him in a single fluid motion. "How many nights?"

"Two, to start. Maybe more. See how the vibes are."

"RM seventy for two nights. Cash preferred."

Connor peeled three fifty-ringgit notes from the thin fold of Malaysian currency he'd exchanged at the airport, and Mei Ling made change with the same economical precision. She placed a key on the counter -- not a key card, an actual key, brass, attached to a wooden fob with the number 3 burned into it.

"Dorm 3, second floor. Bed 7." She slid a laminated sheet across the counter. "House rules."

Connor glanced at the sheet the way he glanced at safety cards on airplanes: with the performative attention of someone who had already decided not to read it.

The rules were printed in four languages -- English, Malay, Mandarin, Japanese -- in a font size that suggested someone had tried to fit a lot of information into a small space. He caught fragments: *Quiet after 11 PM... No drugs on premises... Check-out by 11 AM...* Standard hostel fare. His eyes skated over the text with practised speed, catching nothing, retaining less.

At the bottom of the sheet, in a different colour -- red, the colour of the lanterns, the colour of the sign at the airport, the colour of all the things Connor did not read -- a final line:

*Guests are responsible for knowing and obeying Malaysian law. The hostel is not liable for the consequences of guests' actions.*

Connor picked up the pen on the counter and signed the guest book -- an actual ledger, paper, the pages thick with the accumulated signatures of hundreds of travelers. He signed with the loose, confident scrawl of someone who had signed many guest books in many countries and had never once read what he was signing. His name joined the column of others: a Japanese name, an unreadable European signature, the careful block letters of someone named PRIYA S.

"WiFi password?" he asked.

"On the whiteboard behind you. Changes every Monday."

"Legend."

Mei Ling watched him turn to look at the whiteboard, and in the brief moment when his back was turned, something crossed her face -- not quite concern, not quite recognition. More like the expression of a person who has watched the same movie enough times to know exactly when the jump scare is coming and has stopped flinching but hasn't stopped noticing.

"Enjoy your stay," she said, when he turned back. Her voice was neutral. Her eyes were not.

---

The staircase to the second floor was a relic. Narrow enough that Connor's shoulders nearly brushed both walls, the steps worn into shallow bowls by decades of feet, the wooden bannisters dark with the oil of a thousand hands. Travel stickers from hostels around the world covered the walls -- peeling, overlapping, a geological record of backpacker culture going back years. *Viraporn's Place, Chiang Mai. The Mad Monkey, Phnom Penh. Loki Hostel, La Paz.* Connor recognized some of them. He'd stayed at the Mad Monkey. That was the place with the pool and the happy hour that started at noon. He'd been twenty-three then. A lifetime ago. Three lifetimes.

Dorm 3 was at the end of a corridor lit by two more red lanterns and a single bare bulb. Connor pushed open the door -- no lock, just a handle -- and stepped inside.

Eight beds, arranged in four bunks of two, the frames made of dark wood that might have been beautiful once and was now merely solid. The room was deep and narrow, the architecture of the original shophouse asserting itself -- the building had been designed to be long rather than wide, and the dorm followed suit, stretching back into shadow. There were no windows on the side walls. The only natural light came from the far end, where an opening in the wall looked out onto the air well -- the central shaft of the building, open to the sky, a rectangle of grey afternoon light and the sound of rain beginning to fall somewhere above. The air well carried the smell of wet concrete and the faint, drifting sound of someone playing music on a phone two floors up.

Bed 7 was a bottom bunk, second from the back, against the right wall. Connor tossed his Osprey onto the thin mattress -- the universal hostel mattress, a slab of foam sheathed in vinyl that squeaked when you moved and smelled of disinfectant and the accumulated dreams of strangers. He sat on the edge and bounced, once.

"Not bad," he said, to the empty room.

He unpacked. This was a ritual, and like all of Connor's rituals, it was quick and devoid of ceremony. Four years of backpacking had reduced his possessions to the essentials, or what he considered essentials: three pairs of board shorts (two identical, one with a bleach stain that he'd decided was "character"), four singlets of varying degrees of fading, underwear that he would not submit to close inspection, his Havaianas and a single pair of running shoes he hadn't run in for seven months, a phone charger with a fraying cable, a half-empty bottle of sunscreen, and his toiletries bag -- a Ziploc that contained a toothbrush, toothpaste, a razor he hadn't used in a week, and a stick of deodorant that was optimistic at best.

And the towel.

He pulled it from the bottom of his pack with something approaching reverence. His blue Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel. It was, and Connor would tell you this without prompting, the single best purchase he had ever made. Four years old. Been to every country he'd been to. Dried him on beaches in Bali, in rivers in Laos, in showers in thirty different hostels across Southeast Asia. It was compact -- rolled down to the size of a beer can -- and it was absurdly absorbent, and it dried in an hour, and it was the exact shade of blue as the ocean at Nusa Penida on a clear day. He'd photographed it in twelve countries. It had its own hashtag: #towelofadventure. Eleven posts. Forty-seven total likes.

He draped the towel over the end of the bunk frame, where it hung like a small blue flag.

The last item from his pack was a book: a battered, water-damaged copy of *The Beach* by Alex Garland. He'd bought it at a secondhand bookshop in Bangkok three years ago because it seemed like the kind of book a traveler should have, and he'd been carrying it ever since, reading it in sporadic bursts that never lasted more than ten pages before his phone offered something more immediately stimulating. He was on page eighty-six. He'd been on page eighty-six for four months. He set it on the narrow shelf above his pillow, next to a pair of earplugs left by a previous guest.

Connor lay back on the bunk and stared at the slats above him. The wood was old, scarred, and covered in the graffiti of travelers past -- initials, dates, tiny drawings, the usual declarations of love and obscenity that people leave in places they'll never return to. Someone had drawn a surprisingly detailed penis. Someone else had written *BERLIN FOREVER* in Sharpie. Another hand had carved, with a key or a knife, the words *IF YOU'RE READING THIS, GO HOME*.

Connor smiled. He wouldn't be reading any of it. He was already reaching for his phone before he remembered it was dead. He plugged it in -- the socket was behind the bed frame, requiring a contortion that pressed his face against the mattress of the bunk above -- and lay back.

His right hand rested on the bed frame. His fingers, idly tracing the wood grain, passed over something that wasn't grain. Letters, carved shallow into the dark wood, small and careful, as if the person carving them had been trying to be quiet:

**LENA**

Connor's fingers moved across the name without recognition, without pause, the way a hand moves across a surface in the dark -- registering texture but not meaning. He was already thinking about the WiFi password, about the Instagram post he'd make when his phone came back to life, about whether the hostel had a rooftop. His fingers left Lena's name and found his own knee, which he scratched absently.

If he had looked, he would have seen the name. If he had asked, someone might have told him about the Swedish girl who'd slept in this bed a year ago, who'd been friendly and blonde and trusting, who'd also met a charming European man in the common room, who was now in Kajang Prison, four hundred and seven days into an indefinite wait for a trial that would almost certainly end with a judge pronouncing the words *gantung sampai mati* -- hanged until dead.

But Connor did not look, and did not ask, and instead lay in the dark of Dorm 3 and listened to the rain falling into the air well and thought about absolutely nothing, which was his preferred state and his greatest vulnerability.

---

The common room at dusk was a living thing.

Connor came downstairs at half six, his phone resurrected to nineteen percent, his hair freshly wet from a shower that had oscillated between lukewarm and ambitious-but-cold, wearing clean board shorts and a singlet that read *BINTANG BEER* across the chest in the font of the famous Bali brewery. He'd considered the singlet that said *I SURVIVED THE FULL MOON PARTY* but decided it was trying too hard. The Bintang shirt struck the right balance: casual, travelled, alcoholic without being aggressive about it.

The common room occupied the ground floor's front section, between the reception desk and the kitchen. It was a space that had been furnished, over the years, through what appeared to be a combination of donations, salvage operations, and the gradual accumulation of things that nobody had thrown away. A sofa in brown corduroy, sagging in the middle like a horse that had given up. Two armchairs of different eras and upholstery. A low table covered in ring stains and a half-completed jigsaw puzzle that depicted the Petronas Towers and was missing, Connor would later count, at least thirty pieces. A bookshelf. A wall-mounted TV playing CNN with the volume low, a correspondent standing in front of something on fire somewhere. The ceiling fan. Always the ceiling fan, turning with its slow, eternal patience.

A few travelers were scattered through the room in the poses of early evening -- that liminal hour between the day's exertions and the night's decisions, when backpackers are at their most contemplative, their most sociable, their most vulnerable to suggestion.

A couple on the sofa, European, speaking French, sharing a bag of crisps. A guy with a guitar -- the three-stringed one that lived on the bookshelf -- plucking something that was either very avant-garde or very bad. A woman at the communal computer, an ancient Dell that hummed like a beehive, scrolling with the frustrated intensity of someone trying to load a webpage on a connection that had given up trying.

Through the air well, visible through the arched opening at the back of the room, the last of the daylight was draining from the sky. The rain had stopped, but the air well was still dripping, the sound of water on tile a slow, irregular percussion. Beyond the hostel's walls, the city was performing its evening transformation: the call to prayer from Masjid Jamek, distant but clear, a human voice rising above the traffic noise with the practiced beauty of a ritual performed five times a day; the growl of motorbikes; the first stirrings of the night market; a vendor somewhere calling out prices in a singsong Cantonese that carried over the rooftops and through the air well and into the common room like a voice from another world.

Connor breathed it in. The familiar alchemy was working. The chemical hit of a new place -- novelty cut with comfort, the hostel trick, the sense that you were somewhere foreign but also somewhere safe, that the world was enormous and strange and you had found a small pocket of it that was, for tonight at least, yours. His shoulders dropped. His jaw unclenched. The low-grade anxiety that he carried always -- about money, about the future, about the creeping suspicion that his life was a performance for an audience that didn't exist -- softened to a background hum.

*This is the life*, he thought. Not ironically. Not for content. Just the genuine, uncomplicated thought of a young man in a foreign city at the beginning of something, who did not know yet that the something had a shape, and the shape was a trap, and the trap had been baited long before he landed.

He walked to the small cooler behind the reception desk -- Mei Ling was gone, replaced by a laminated sign that read *BEER RM8, PAY TOMORROW, WE KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP* -- and pulled out a can of Tiger. The beer was cold and good. He popped it and took a long pull and stood there for a moment, surveying the common room with the proprietary satisfaction of a man who has just claimed his territory.

That was when someone said his name.

Not his name, exactly. His nationality, which for a certain type of Australian male abroad amounts to the same thing.

"Hey, Australia."

Connor turned. The voice had come from the far corner of the common room, past the jigsaw table and the guitar player, near the arched doorway that led to the air well. A man was sitting there in one of the mismatched armchairs, one leg crossed over the other, a posture of studied ease. He was tall -- Connor could tell even though the man was seated -- and lean, with close-cropped dark hair and an angular face that looked like it had been designed to sell something expensive. He wore a linen shirt, white, improbably clean for a backpacker hostel, the sleeves rolled to the elbows with a precision that suggested the roll itself had been considered. Leather sandals. No visible tattoos. A thin scar through his left eyebrow, a small imperfection that somehow made the rest of his face more symmetrical.

He was holding two beers. He was smiling. The smile was the kind that created an immediate, instinctive binary in the people who received it: either you trusted this man completely, or you didn't trust him at all. There was no middle register.

Connor, who had never met a stranger he didn't provisionally adore, felt the warmth of the smile before he'd consciously registered the face.

"You look like you could use one of these," the man said, lifting one of the beers. His English was accented -- German, maybe, or Dutch -- and precise, each word placed like a tile in a mosaic.

Connor grinned. The grin was automatic, the same grin he'd flashed at the woman on the plane, at the immigration officer, at the pen-lending father, at Mei Ling. The grin of a man who believed, in his bones, that the world was a friendly place full of friendly people who existed, on some level, to make his journey more interesting.

"Legend," Connor said.

He walked over.

The man extended the beer and, when Connor took it, offered his other hand. The handshake was firm, dry, and lasted exactly the right amount of time.

"Felix," the man said. "Felix Decker. Welcome to The Lantern."

"Connor. Just got in from Bali."

"I know," Felix said, and his smile widened by a fraction. "I can always tell. The tan, the boardshorts, the flip-flops. Bali is a uniform."

Connor laughed. It was a good line. He dropped into the empty chair opposite Felix and cracked the beer. Tiger again. He'd drink anything, but Tiger felt right. Tiger felt like Malaysia.

"How long you been here?" Connor asked.

"At The Lantern? A few weeks. In KL? On and off for a year." Felix sipped his beer. "I travel for work. Photography. KL is a good base."

"Photographer. Sick. I'm sort of in the same space -- social media, content creation, digital nomad stuff." Connor heard himself say these words and felt the usual small thrill of presenting the fiction as fact. It wasn't exactly a lie. He did post things on social media. He had, once, been paid forty dollars to write an Instagram caption for a surf school in Canggu. These facts, arranged correctly, constituted a career.

Felix nodded, and in his nod was something that Connor didn't detect -- a flicker of assessment, the brief, clinical appraisal of a professional evaluating raw material. It was there and gone in less than a second.

"A content creator," Felix said. "I like that. So what's your plan for KL?"

"No plan," Connor said, and he said it the way he always said it -- as a declaration of philosophy, as a badge of identity, as the thing that separated him from the ordinary people back home who planned their lives into submission. "Plans are for amateurs. I just go where the city takes me."

"I like that even more," Felix said. He leaned back in his chair, crossed his ankles, and looked at Connor with an expression of what appeared to be genuine interest. "A man with no plan. KL is a good city for men with no plans. There's always something happening here. You just have to know where to look."

The ceiling fan turned above them. CNN murmured about a crisis in a country Connor couldn't locate on a map. The guitar player had given up and was now examining the instrument with the confused respect of someone who had just been defeated by an inanimate object. Through the air well, the night sounds of Petaling Street were building -- the clink of dishes, the hiss of rain on hot metal, the laughter of people who knew this city and lived in it and belonged to it.

Felix raised his beer. "To no plans," he said.

Connor raised his. "To no plans."

They drank. The beer was cold. The night was warm. The lanterns glowed red above them, and somewhere on the second floor, in an empty dorm, a blue towel hung from a bed frame like a flag of surrender, and a dead girl's name waited in the wood for someone who would never read it.

Connor Briggs was twenty-seven years old, and he had just arrived in the city where he would die, and the city didn't care, and neither did he, and the beers were eight ringgit each, and the night was young, and everything, everything, was going to be fine.
# Chapter 2: The German

The beer was cold and it was free and that was enough for Connor Briggs.

He took the bottle without hesitation -- a Tiger, sweating in the heat, its label already peeling -- and dropped himself into the nearest chair in the common room of The Lantern Hostel like a man arriving at a party that had been waiting for him. The European who'd handed it to him was still standing, one arm resting on the back of an adjacent chair, watching Connor with an expression of mild, unreadable amusement.

"Cheers, mate," Connor said, and took a long pull. The beer was crisp and bitter and exactly what he needed after a day of cheap flights and cheaper trains and hauling his pack through the wet furnace of Kuala Lumpur's streets. He let the cold settle in his chest and looked around the common room.

It was a good room. The red paper lanterns -- dozens of them, strung across the ceiling on wires that sagged in the humidity -- threw a warm amber light over everything, softening the mismatched furniture, the battered bookshelf stuffed with abandoned novels in six languages, the TV mounted on the wall playing CNN with the sound off. Two ceiling fans rotated overhead in that slow, thoughtful way that ceiling fans have in the tropics, as if they'd long ago accepted that the heat would win and were just going through the motions. The tile floor was cool underfoot, the old encaustic pattern cracked and uneven, and the air smelled of cooking oil and Tiger Balm and the faintly sweet rot of old wood in a wet climate. Through the central air well -- that strange open shaft in the building's core -- Connor could hear motorbikes on Petaling Street, the thump of bass from the clubs on Changkat, a cat screaming at something in the alley. The sounds came down the air well amplified and distorted, as if the building were cupping its hand around its ear.

*This is the vibe,* Connor thought. *This is what travel looks like.*

"You just arrived today?" the European said.

Connor looked at him properly for the first time. The man was tall and lean, maybe early thirties, with the kind of angular face that belonged on the cover of a men's travel magazine -- sharp jaw, close-cropped dark hair, cheekbones you could slice cheese on. He was dressed in a clean linen shirt, untucked, with well-fitted shorts and leather sandals that looked like they cost more than Connor's entire backpack. There was a thin scar through his left eyebrow, a pale line that caught the lantern light when he tilted his head. He didn't look like a backpacker. He looked like someone who'd been cast to play a backpacker in a European art film.

"Yeah, flew in from Bali this arvo," Connor said. "AirAsia. Absolute cattle class, but you can't beat fifty bucks."

"From Bali," the man repeated, and smiled. It was a good smile -- warm, unhurried, like he had nowhere to be and nothing to do except hear about Connor's day. "How was it?"

"Bali? Yeah, it was sick. Did Seminyak for a bit, then Canggu. Got the tattoo topped up." Connor pulled up his left sleeve to show the compass on his inner forearm, the lines faded to blue-grey from sun and salt water. "The surf was going off. You been?"

"Twice," the man said. He sat down across from Connor, crossing one leg over the other with the ease of someone who was always comfortable. "But I preferred Siargao. In the Philippines. The surf is better and the tourists haven't found it yet." He paused. "Well. They're finding it now."

"Siargao," Connor said, filing it away. He didn't know where it was, exactly, but he'd look it up later. Or not. The name was enough -- he could drop it in conversation, on Instagram, the way you collected stamps. *Been meaning to hit Siargao. Mate of mine says the surf is unreal.* "Mate, I haven't even asked -- what's your name?"

"Felix," the man said. "Felix Decker."

He extended his hand and Connor shook it. The grip was firm, dry, precise -- the handshake of a man who'd practiced it.

"Connor. Connor Briggs. From Melbourne."

"Melbourne," Felix said, as if this was interesting. "A great city. I spent a month there in 2019. Fitzroy. The coffee is exceptional."

"Fitzroy! Legend. That's basically my neighbourhood. Well, Hawthorn, but close enough." It wasn't close enough, geographically or culturally, but Connor had learned to blur the distinction. "Where are you from?"

"Hamburg. Germany."

"No way. I love Germans. Every hostel I've been in, you guys are there. Efficient, you know? Always got the best gear." Connor grinned and gestured at Felix's outfit. "Case in point."

Felix laughed -- a short, clean sound, like the closing of a well-made door. "We do take our packing seriously." He tilted his Tiger towards Connor. "Welcome to The Lantern. It's a good place."

"Yeah? How long have you been here?"

"Two months."

Connor's bottle paused halfway to his mouth. "Two months? In a hostel? In KL?"

"KL has layers," Felix said. He held Connor's gaze for a beat longer than was strictly normal. "Most travelers pass through in three days. See the Towers, eat at Jalan Alor, take a selfie at Batu Caves, move on. They never get past the surface."

"And you're past the surface?"

"I'm a photographer," Felix said. "I need time. I need to understand a place before I can photograph it properly." He shrugged one shoulder, an elegant continental gesture. "So I stay. I watch. I learn."

*A photographer,* Connor thought. That explained the polish, the confidence, the sense that Felix was always composing a frame. Connor understood people in creative fields. He was, after all, basically in a creative field himself. Social media consulting was a creative pursuit. It was. He'd told people that enough times that it was true.

"That's sick," Connor said. "What kind of photography?"

"Documentary, mostly. Remote villages. Markets. The human infrastructure of places tourists don't see." Felix took a measured sip of his beer. "I spent three months in Myanmar last year, in the hills north of Mandalay. Villages that don't appear on any map. The people there have never seen a smartphone." He smiled at a private memory. "It was extraordinary."

"Mate. That sounds unreal."

"It was. I have a photo of a Shan woman, ninety years old, her face tattooed in the traditional way, and she's laughing at something her granddaughter said. It's the best photo I've ever taken." Felix shook his head. "Probably the best photo I'll ever take."

Connor believed every word of it. The story had texture, specifics, the Shan woman's tattooed face and the granddaughter's joke and the hills north of Mandalay. It sounded true because it sounded lived. What Connor couldn't hear -- what he had no ear for -- was the polish. The way the story's beats landed with the precision of a comedian's set, each detail chosen for maximum effect, the pause before the final line calibrated to make it feel spontaneous. Felix told stories the way a watchmaker assembled movements: every gear in place, every spring under tension, and the whole mechanism invisible behind the face.

"So what do you do, Connor?" Felix asked. He leaned forward slightly, elbows on knees. The posture said: *I'm genuinely interested.*

This was the part Connor liked. He had the spiel down cold.

"I'm a digital nomad," he said. "Location independent. Social media consulting, mostly -- I help brands with their online presence, content strategy, that kind of thing. The beauty of it is I can work from anywhere, right? All I need is a laptop and wifi." He took a swig of Tiger. "I've been doing it for four years now. Since I dropped out of uni. Best decision I ever made."

"Impressive," Felix said. "And your clients are--?"

"Global," Connor said, which was technically true if you counted a yoga studio in Northcote, Melbourne, that paid him one hundred and fifty dollars a month to run their Instagram. "I've got a few regulars and then I pick up freelance stuff as I go. It's not about the money, though, you know? It's about the freedom. The experiences."

Felix nodded slowly, as if he were absorbing something profound. "I understand that. The freedom. It's why I do what I do, too." He held up his bottle. "To freedom, then."

They clinked bottles. The sound was small and bright in the warm room.

"Speaking of," Felix said, "are you hungry? The cook here -- Mama Siti -- she makes the best nasi lemak in Chinatown. Five ringgit. An absolute steal."

"I could eat."

"I'll get us two plates." Felix stood, and Connor watched him walk to the kitchen counter with the loose, unhurried stride of a man who owned the space he moved through. He spoke to the ancient woman behind the counter in what sounded like Malay -- fluid, easy, nothing like a tourist reading from a phrasebook. The old woman, small and hunched and wrapped in a headscarf that made her look like a cloth doll, peered up at Felix with dark eyes that seemed to be measuring something behind his face. She ladled rice and sambal and anchovies onto two plates without smiling.

*He speaks Malay,* Connor thought. *Two months here and he speaks the language. That's commitment.* It didn't occur to Connor to wonder why a German travel photographer would invest that heavily in a place he was only passing through. It didn't occur to him to wonder about any of it. Felix was interesting, generous, and cool, and Connor liked interesting, generous, cool people. That was the beginning and end of his assessment.

Felix returned with two plates of nasi lemak, the coconut rice fragrant and steaming, flanked by crispy anchovies, roasted peanuts, half a boiled egg, a cucumber slice, and a devastating red sambal that smelled of chillies and dried shrimp and something darker beneath. He set one plate in front of Connor and sat back down.

"Enjoy."

Connor ate. It was incredible -- the coconut rice rich and nutty, the sambal nuclear, the anchovies shattering between his teeth. The flavours were layered and complex in a way that made him want to photograph the plate and immediately felt inadequate to describe it.

"This is unreal," he said, mouth full.

"Mama Siti has been cooking since before this building was a hostel," Felix said. "Since before it was a brothel, if you believe Uncle Razak."

"A brothel?"

"The building has had many lives. Warehouse, brothel, gambling den. Japanese headquarters during the war." Felix ate neatly, precisely, his fork and spoon working in the Malaysian style. "The walls remember everything."

Connor looked at the walls. Peeling paint, faded plaster, the ghosts of old signage in Chinese characters. The red lanterns hung from wires like paper organs, pulsing gently in the current from the ceiling fans. He could almost believe it -- that the building was alive, that it remembered. Almost. Then he took another bite of nasi lemak and the thought dissolved in sambal.

---

The American arrived like a weather event.

"Dude. DUDE. Is this the common room? This is sick. This is, like, the sickest common room I've ever been in. Are those real lanterns? Are they, like, actual paper? Can I touch one?"

He was stocky, sunburned to a shade of aggressive pink, wearing a backwards cap over sandy hair, a surf brand t-shirt two sizes too small, and the permanent grin of a golden retriever who'd just discovered a tennis ball factory. He stood in the doorway of the common room with a beer in one hand and the other extended towards the nearest lantern, fingers reaching.

"I wouldn't," Felix said mildly. "They're old. And flammable."

"Right. Right, right, right. Smart." The American retracted his hand and turned his grin on Connor and Felix. "Hey, I'm Jake. Jake Porter. San Diego."

"Connor. Melbourne."

"No way! Australia? Dude, I love Australians. You guys are, like, the Americans of the Southern Hemisphere."

Connor wasn't sure this was a compliment, but he liked Jake immediately. There was something disarmingly guileless about him -- his enthusiasm was too large and too unqualified to be anything but real. He was the human equivalent of a labrador: loyal, eager, absolutely no idea what was going on.

"Pull up a chair, mate," Connor said. "The German here is buying."

Felix smiled. "I'm Felix. And apparently I'm buying."

"Dude, a German! No way. My roommate at SDSU was German. Klaus. Crazy dude. Used to drink beer for breakfast." Jake dropped into a chair, which protested audibly. "Not, like, in a bad way. In a German way."

"We do have a reputation," Felix said, and the warmth in his voice was exactly right -- amused but not condescending, welcoming the new addition without seeming to try. He reached behind his chair and produced another Tiger from a plastic bag Connor hadn't noticed. The bag had at least six more in it. "Beer?"

"Dude. Yes. Thank you." Jake cracked it open with practiced ease. "So what's the deal with this place? How long have you guys been here?"

"I arrived today," Connor said.

"Two months," Felix said.

Jake's eyes went wide. "Two months? In a hostel? Dude, that's, like--"

"Commitment," Connor offered.

"I was going to say nuts, but sure. Commitment." Jake drank. "I've been in KL for, like, four days? Five? I don't know. What day is it?"

"Wednesday," Felix said.

"Cool. Cool cool cool. Is it, though? I feel like it's Thursday. Whatever. Days are just, like, labels, right? Social constructs."

"Profound," Felix said, and Connor caught the faintest flicker of something in his eyes -- not contempt, exactly, but assessment. A quick, surgical look, the kind a mechanic gives an engine before deciding if it's worth fixing. Then it was gone, replaced by the warm smile, and Felix was pouring Jake another beer from a fresh bottle before Jake's first was half empty.

They talked. The conversation followed the predictable hostel trajectory -- where are you from, where have you been, where are you going -- the same catechism repeated in common rooms across Southeast Asia, a liturgy of itineraries and recommendations and "oh you HAVE to go to" that served less as information exchange and more as mutual verification of tribal membership. *We are travelers. We are the same. We belong here.*

Jake was twenty-four, from San Diego, "taking a year off" after college. When Connor asked what he'd studied, Jake said "business" with the cheerful indifference of a man who'd already forgotten. The year off had been two years now, a fact Jake volunteered without embarrassment. He'd been to Thailand ("insane"), Vietnam ("also insane"), Indonesia ("bro, INSANE"), and was now "just vibing" his way through Malaysia before heading to -- he paused to think -- "wherever, dude. I don't plan."

"A man after my own heart," Connor said.

"Yeah, dude! Plans are, like -- plans are for people who are afraid of life, you know?"

Connor knew. He'd said the same thing a hundred times, in a hundred common rooms, and every time he said it he believed it slightly more and the truth receded slightly further. The truth being: he didn't plan because planning required admitting he didn't know what he was doing. But here, in the red lantern glow of a hostel common room, surrounded by people who'd made the same choice, the absence of a plan felt like liberation rather than deficit.

Other travelers drifted through the common room as the night deepened. A French couple arguing softly about Penang. A solo Korean woman reading *Sapiens* on a beanbag. Two British lads comparing Tinder matches. The hostel at night was a living thing -- bodies flowing in and out, conversations starting and ending and merging, the communal kitchen clanging as someone boiled ramen, a phone playing lo-fi beats from a shelf. The red lanterns swayed in the draft from the air well, and the ceiling fans rotated, and the tile floor was cool, and it was, Connor thought, exactly the kind of place he'd been looking for without knowing he was looking.

Felix moved through it all like a host. He seemed to know everyone -- greeting the French couple by name, asking the Korean woman about her book, trading a joke in halting French with one of the British lads. He was generous with the beers, pulling them from his seemingly bottomless plastic bag, always cold, always offered before you realized you wanted one. His stories were perfect: a street food crawl in Penang that nearly ended in a fistfight over the best char kway teow, a sunrise hike in the Cameron Highlands with a group of monks, a near-miss with a monitor lizard while kayaking in Langkawi. Each story was specific and vivid and landed with a punchline, and each one ended with Felix turning the conversation back to someone else. "But tell me about your trip. Where have you been?"

He was, Connor decided, the best kind of traveler. The kind who'd seen everything and wasn't a wanker about it.

"This bloke's been everywhere," Connor told Jake, thumbing towards Felix. "Myanmar, Philippines, the lot."

"Dude. That's sick. I want to do Myanmar but like, isn't it, like -- heavy there right now?"

"It's complicated," Felix said. "But the people are extraordinary. The most generous people I've ever met." He smiled. "And the beer is cheap."

"That's all I need to know, dude."

Connor laughed. Jake was an idiot, but he was the right kind of idiot -- uncomplicated, enthusiastic, safe. He was the kind of mate you wanted at a party: would never steal your drink, would always laugh at your jokes, and would never, under any circumstances, ask you a hard question. Connor collected people like Jake the way some people collected stamps -- quickly, casually, and without bothering to learn their real value.

---

Sometime after eleven, when the French couple had gone to bed and the British lads had headed to Changkat and the common room had thinned to its late-night residents, Felix looked at Connor and Jake and said, "Rooftop?"

They climbed the narrow staircase single-file, the old wooden steps groaning under their weight. The staircase was barely wide enough for one person -- Connor's shoulders nearly touched both walls -- and the air grew warmer as they ascended, the building holding its heat like a clay oven. On the second-floor landing, Connor caught a glimpse of Japanese characters showing through the peeling paint, faded military signage from the occupation era, and felt a small chill that he immediately dismissed as a draft from the air well.

The third floor was quieter, darker. Two doors on the right -- dorms -- and two on the left. One of the left-hand doors was open a crack, revealing a room barely larger than a closet, but with a real bed, a nightstand, a reading lamp. A private room. Felix's door, Connor assumed, because Felix paused there for a moment and reached inside to grab something -- another bag of beers -- before closing the door and locking it with a key.

*A private room,* Connor noted. *In a hostel. For two months.*

The thought surfaced and sank without consequence, like a fish breaking the surface of a pond. It was odd, sure. Private rooms in hostels weren't cheap -- maybe RM85 a night, which over two months was... Connor didn't do the math because Connor didn't do math, but it was a lot. More than a travel photographer working on speculative documentary projects should be spending. But then Felix always seemed to have money, and some people just did, and Connor wasn't the kind of person who questioned other people's finances because that would invite questions about his own.

The rooftop was a revelation.

They emerged through a fire door propped open with a brick and stepped out onto a flat concrete terrace ringed by a low wall that was probably not up to code. Plastic chairs were scattered about in no discernible pattern, a clothesline stretched between two poles with someone's underwear and sarongs flapping in the night breeze, and there -- there, above the corrugated zinc rooftops of Chinatown, above the tangle of electrical wires that cross-hatched the sky like a mad architect's blueprints, above the dark mass of the Guan Di temple and the glowing neon of Petaling Street's shuttered market stalls -- there were the Petronas Towers.

They rose from the city like two silver syringes, lit from within, their faceted surfaces catching and refracting the light so that they seemed to pulse against the dark sky. The skybridge connecting them at the forty-first floor hung like a filament of light suspended between two columns of glass. Everything around them -- the office blocks, the construction cranes, the distant ridge of jungle-covered hills -- fell away into darkness, and the Towers stood alone, ridiculous and beautiful and utterly dominant, saying what they'd been built to say: *We are here. We are the future. Look at us.*

"Jesus," Connor breathed.

"That never gets old," Felix said. He'd already settled into a plastic chair and was opening beers with a Swiss Army knife he'd produced from his pocket. Always prepared, always equipped, always one step ahead of the moment. "Here."

Connor took the beer and sat down. Jake sat beside him, his mouth still open at the skyline.

"Dude. Those are the Petronas Towers."

"They are," Felix confirmed.

"I've seen pictures. But, like -- dude. They're RIGHT THERE."

"That's what I love about this rooftop," Felix said. "You're in Chinatown, which is ancient. Half these buildings are a hundred years old. And then you look up and there's the twenty-first century, right there." He took a sip. "Layers."

Connor drank and watched the Towers and felt something open in his chest -- not an emotion, exactly, but a kind of vindication. This was the moment. This was the shot. The rooftop terrace, the beers, the new mates, the Petronas Towers glittering against the Malaysian sky. This was the life that people back in Hawthorn, back in their cubicles and their mortgages and their Monday meetings, would never understand. He was living. Actually living.

He took out his phone and photographed the skyline. Then he photographed his beer with the Towers behind it. Then he adjusted the angle and took a selfie -- the three of them, Connor in the front, Felix behind his left shoulder, Jake behind his right, the Towers between them. He didn't post it yet. He'd find the right filter in the morning.

They talked. Jake dominated the first twenty minutes with a story about getting lost in Ho Chi Minh City that was approximately sixty percent digressions and forty percent "and then, dude, get this." Felix listened with what appeared to be genuine engagement, asking follow-up questions that made Jake feel like his story was interesting, which it was not. Connor marvelled at it -- at the patience, the generosity of attention. Most people would have glazed over three minutes into Jake's labyrinthine narration. Felix leaned in.

The night expanded around them. The heat softened to something bearable -- not cool, never cool, but the edge taken off by the breeze that moved across the rooftops, carrying the smell of char kway teow and diesel and jasmine from the temple below. The city sounds rose and fell -- a motorcycle accelerating on Jalan Sultan, the distant thrum of a club's bass line, a woman laughing in the apartment block across the street, the endless, irreducible hum of a city of eight million people settling into its evening.

Around midnight, Jake yawned. It was a yawn of magnificent proportions -- a full-body, eye-watering, jaw-cracking performance that seemed to temporarily dislocate his face.

"Dudes. I'm done. I'm, like, dead." He stood and nearly knocked over his chair. "What time is it? Midnight? Bro. That's, like, my bed time in San Diego. I mean, no it isn't. But tonight it is." He pointed at Connor. "You. Tomorrow. We're exploring. I saw a sign for like a bird park or something."

"The KL Bird Park," Felix said. "It's good."

"See? The German knows. Felix knows." Jake clasped Felix's hand in a complicated handshake that Felix navigated flawlessly. "Thanks for the beers, dude. You're a legend."

"Goodnight, Jake."

"Night, dudes. Night, Petronas." Jake waved at the Towers, then stumbled through the fire door and was gone, his footsteps descending the staircase in a series of creaks and thuds.

And then it was two.

---

The silence that followed Jake's departure was different. It had texture. Felix let it breathe for a while, sipping his beer, his eyes on the skyline, his face half-lit by the city's ambient glow. Without Jake's cheerful noise filling the space, Connor became aware of smaller sounds: the click of insects, the hum of an air conditioning unit somewhere below, the distant call to prayer from a mosque he couldn't see -- late, mournful, beautiful.

"He's a good guy," Felix said eventually.

"Jake? Yeah, he's a crack-up."

"Very American." Felix smiled. "Not much going on behind the eyes, but a good heart."

"That's harsh, mate."

"It's observation, not criticism. I like Jake. People like Jake are important. They keep things light." Felix turned the beer bottle slowly in his fingers. "But I don't think Jake is someone who wants more from travel than the surface. The photos, the parties, the 'I was there.' You know?"

Connor said nothing. He was aware that Felix was drawing a distinction -- between Jake and Connor, between surface travelers and something else -- and that the distinction was flattering to him.

"You're different," Felix said, as if reading the thought. "I could tell when we started talking. You're not just passing through. You're trying to understand something."

"Mate, I'm just winging it, to be honest."

"No. You're not." Felix looked at him. The scar on his eyebrow caught the light. "You dropped out of university to travel. You built a career around freedom. That takes courage. Most people talk about breaking free, but they never actually do it."

Connor felt something warm and unfamiliar move through him. It was the feeling of being seen -- not the Instagram version, not the curated feed, but the actual person underneath. Or at least, the person he wanted to believe was underneath.

"I just couldn't do the nine-to-five thing," Connor said. "I watched my dad go to work every day, come home tired, do it again. And for what? A house in the suburbs? A car? I wanted more than that."

"And you got more."

"I think so. Yeah."

Felix nodded slowly. "I understand that. When I left Hamburg, my family thought I was insane. A good German boy doesn't become a photographer. A good German boy studies engineering, gets a job at Siemens, marries a girl named Katrin, and buys a Volkswagen." He laughed softly. "My mother still asks when I'm coming home."

"Mine too," Connor said, and for a moment they were just two men on a rooftop in a city that wasn't home, bonding over the particular guilt of the runaway. It felt real. It probably was real, on some level -- the story about Felix's mother might even have been true. The best lies are built on foundations of truth, and Felix was a master architect.

"How do you afford it?" Connor asked. The beer had loosened his tongue. "Two months in a private room. All the beers. The travel. Photography doesn't pay that well, does it?"

Felix's expression didn't change, but something behind it shifted -- a door closing and another opening, so smoothly that you'd only notice if you were watching for it. Connor was not watching for it.

"It doesn't," Felix admitted. "Not the documentary work. That's for love, not money." He paused, seemed to consider something, then continued in a lower, more confidential tone. "But I've been in Southeast Asia for a long time. You learn how things work. How the economies really function. There are... opportunities that don't appear in any guidebook."

"What kind of opportunities?"

"Logistics, mostly. Helping people move things from one place to another. Connecting buyers with sellers. Import-export on a small scale." Felix waved a hand, as if these were trivial details. "Nothing glamorous. But it supplements the photography. And it means I can stay as long as I want, wherever I want."

Connor nodded. It made sense. Southeast Asia was full of hustles -- everyone he'd met was running some angle, from the tuk-tuk drivers in Bangkok to the surf instructors in Bali who sold weed on the side. Felix's version sounded cleaner, more professional, but the principle was the same: find the gap, fill it, get paid.

"Smart," Connor said.

"Practical," Felix corrected. "I prefer to think of it as practical." He drained his beer and set it down with a precise click on the concrete beside his chair. "And what about you, Connor? How's the social media consulting business?"

The question was asked without malice, but Connor heard the gears turning inside it. Felix already knew. He'd seen the way Connor had flinched, microscopic but visible, when the conversation turned to money. He'd noticed the old phone, the fraying board shorts, the way Connor had accepted the free beer with a gratitude that was just a shade too eager.

"Yeah, it's good," Connor said. "Ticking along."

"Good."

A silence. Connor drank. The Petronas Towers pulsed against the sky.

"Look," Felix said, "I'm going to say something, and you can absolutely say no. No pressure, no offence taken."

"Go for it."

"I could use someone reliable around here." Felix said it casually, almost as an afterthought, the way you'd mention that you'd seen a good restaurant down the street. "Just small stuff. Logistics. I've got the photography business -- the legitimate side -- and it needs occasional help. Runners. Someone to deliver prints, pick up equipment, that kind of thing. It's not full-time. A few hours a week. But it pays."

The offer hung in the warm night air between them. Below, a motorcycle growled through the alley. The clothesline flapped. The Petronas Towers watched from across the city, twin sentinels, indifferent and magnificent.

"How much?" Connor asked, and hated himself slightly for asking so quickly.

"Depends on the job. Two, three hundred ringgit per delivery. Sometimes more." Felix shrugged. "It adds up."

Two hundred ringgit was about sixty Australian dollars. For a delivery. Connor's freelance rate for a full month of Instagram management was a hundred and fifty dollars. The maths -- for once, the maths -- were clear.

"No offence," Connor said, "but I literally just met you."

"Of course." Felix held up his hands. "I'd be suspicious if you said yes immediately. Think about it. There's no deadline." He stood, smoothly, and collected both their empty bottles, his and Connor's, holding them loosely by the necks. Always cleaning up, Connor noticed. The common room earlier, the beer bottles, the nasi lemak plates -- Felix left no mess behind him. It was the tidiness of a man who was either deeply considerate or deeply careful, and Connor chose to read it as the former.

"I'm heading down," Felix said. "Long day tomorrow -- I've got a shoot in Brickfields." He tucked the bottles under one arm. "Think about what I said, Connor. No pressure."

"Yeah. Yeah, I will."

Felix smiled. "Goodnight, Connor."

"Night, mate."

He watched Felix cross the rooftop and disappear through the fire door, moving with that unhurried, confident stride. A moment later, Connor heard footsteps descending, then a door opening and closing on the third floor. The private room. Felix's private room, where he'd lived for two months, paying rates that would have drained Connor's bank account in a fortnight.

*How does he afford that?* Connor thought.

And then: *Maybe that's exactly what he's offering to show me.*

He sat alone on the rooftop for a while longer, finishing a beer that Felix had left open for him on the armrest of the adjacent chair. The man had known Connor would stay. He'd prepared for it. Connor didn't find this unsettling. He found it thoughtful.

The city murmured below. A siren in the middle distance, rising and falling. The bass from the clubs on Changkat had faded to a faint pulse, like a heartbeat. The Petronas Towers' lights shifted through some programmed cycle, blue to white to silver, and the skybridge between them glowed. The sky above KL was too polluted for stars, but the city made its own constellation -- a sprawl of light that went to every horizon, pulsing, alive.

*This could be something,* Connor thought. Not the delivery thing specifically, but the whole picture -- KL, the hostel, Felix's connections, a way to stay that didn't involve crawling home to Hawthorn with his tail between his legs. A life. The kind of life he posted about but hadn't quite achieved. The kind where the money flowed and the doors opened and every sunset was earned rather than stolen.

He stood, stretched, and headed for the fire door. The staircase groaned under him as he descended, third step from the top squeaking like it always did, like it had for a hundred years. Second floor. Dorm 3. He pushed the door open quietly.

The room was dark except for the blue glow of phone screens and a faint red light that filtered through the gap above the door -- the lanterns in the hallway, never extinguished, casting their warm arterial glow across the threshold. Eight bunks, most occupied. The breathing of strangers in the dark, the private sounds of sleep -- a murmur, a shift, the scratch of a hand against a sheet. The room smelled of insect repellent and sweat and the slightly sour scent of clothes that had been hand-washed in a sink and hung to dry in humidity that never let anything fully dry.

Connor climbed into Bed 7 -- lower bunk, against the wall, the one with the mattress that was thin enough to feel the wooden slats through the foam. He plugged in his phone and lay on his back, staring at the ceiling. The fan above him rotated in slow circles, click-click-clicking where one blade was slightly off balance, a metronome measuring out the night in irregular intervals.

His phone buzzed. He picked it up, squinting at the brightness.

A notification from his banking app. He tapped it, already knowing and dreading.

**Available Balance: $847.32 AUD**

He stared at the number. Eight hundred and forty-seven dollars. His flights from Bali had cost four hundred. Hostel was thirty-five ringgit a night -- about twelve dollars -- but over a week that was eighty-four. Food. Transport. Beers. The number had been bigger when he'd last checked in Bali, but he hadn't checked carefully, because careful checking was a form of planning, and planning was for people who were afraid of life.

Eight forty-seven. His parents' next deposit wasn't for ten days. If he was careful -- genuinely careful, rice and instant noodles careful -- he could stretch it to three weeks. After that: the credit card, which was already carrying two thousand dollars he tried not to think about. After the credit card: phone calls. The kind of phone calls where you hear your father sigh before he speaks, and the sigh says more than the words that follow.

Or.

Two hundred ringgit per delivery. Sixty bucks. A few hours a week. Felix's offer, sitting there like a door left open.

Connor closed the banking app and opened Instagram instead. His latest post -- a photo of the Petaling Street night market stalls from that afternoon, captioned "KL, you absolute legend" -- had thirty-one likes. He scrolled through the comments. Three fire emojis, a "Living the dream bro" from a mate in Sydney, and a "Miss you xx" from a girl he'd met in Chiang Mai whose name he'd already forgotten.

Thirty-one likes. He told people he had about five thousand followers. He had 4,217. Close enough. The number hadn't moved in months.

He put his phone down and rolled onto his side. Through the thin wall, he could hear the air well amplifying the sounds of the city settling -- a last motorcycle, a dog barking, the rattle of a shutter being pulled down over a shop front. The ceiling fan clicked. Someone in a lower bunk muttered in their sleep, something in a language Connor didn't recognize.

He thought about Felix's smile on the rooftop. The easy confidence of it. The way he'd said "someone reliable" -- not "someone available" or "someone who needs cash," but "reliable." It was a word that meant something. It was a word that suggested Felix saw in Connor a quality that Connor wanted to believe he possessed. Reliable. Trustworthy. The kind of person you brought into your inner circle.

*She'll be right,* Connor thought. *It's just deliveries. Photography equipment. Prints. Felix is a photographer, it makes sense. And even if it's something else, so what? Everyone's got a hustle out here. That's how it works. That's how Asia works.*

He closed his eyes. The red glow of the hallway lantern filtered through the gap above the door, painting the inside of his eyelids a warm, shifting red. It pulsed there, rhythmic, alive, like the building itself was breathing, like the old shophouse was drawing air in through its central well and exhaling it out through its cracks and gaps and half-closed doors.

The last thought before sleep was not a thought but an image: Felix collecting the empty bottles on the rooftop, holding them loosely by the necks, carrying them away. A man who leaves no trace. A man who cleans up after himself.

Connor slept. The fan clicked. The lantern pulsed.

Outside, Kuala Lumpur hummed on, vast and hot and indifferent to the small dramas unfolding in its oldest buildings. The Petronas Towers stood watch over the city like chrome headstones, beautiful and meaningless, catching the light of a moon that nobody on the rooftop had thought to look up and see.

In his private room on the third floor, Felix Decker set down two empty beer bottles on his nightstand, aligned perfectly parallel. He opened his phone and typed a message in German to a number with a Hong Kong area code. The message was short.

*Neuer Junge. Australier. Leichtglaubig. Er wird ja sagen.*

New boy. Australian. Gullible. He will say yes.

He locked his phone, placed it face-down beside the bottles, and turned off his reading lamp. The room went dark except for the red glow bleeding under the door from the hallway lanterns.

Felix closed his eyes and slept the easy, dreamless sleep of a man who had done this many times before.
# Chapter 3: Petaling Street

The call to prayer woke him at 5:30 in the morning.

Connor didn't know what it was at first. The sound bled through the dorm's thin walls like something from a dream he was already forgetting -- a long, wavering note that seemed to hang in the humid air, rising and falling, reaching for something beyond the cracked plaster ceiling. He lay in Bed 7, blinking at the underside of the bunk above him, trying to slot the sound into a category his brain could file and dismiss. Not a siren. Not music, exactly. Something older than either.

He pulled his pillow over his head and went back to sleep.

When he woke again, it was ten past nine, and the dorm was empty. Every other bunk was made or unmade but abandoned -- the German guy from Dorm 2 who wore hiking boots to breakfast, the Korean couple who always left before dawn, the silent Scandinavian woman who Connor had never actually heard speak. All gone. Out in the city being productive travelers while Connor lay in his own sweat on a foam mattress that smelled faintly of Tiger Balm and the bodies of everyone who'd slept on it before him.

He checked his phone. Three percent battery. He'd forgotten to charge it again. The Instagram notification count sat at seven -- he tapped it before anything else, the way other people checked for earthquakes or air-raid warnings. Three new followers (all bots), two likes on yesterday's sunset shot from the rooftop, and a comment from his mother: *Please call when you can sweetheart Dad and I worry xx.* He swiped it away. There was also a text from Jake: *dude where are you breakfast is INSANE come to kitchen.* The timestamp said 8:14 AM. An hour ago. Connor groaned, swung his legs off the bunk, and stepped barefoot onto the tile floor.

The tiles were cool and uneven beneath his feet, cracked in geometric patterns that might have been decorative a century ago but now just caught his toes at odd angles. He shuffled out of the dorm and onto the second-floor landing, and the hostel opened up around him in the morning light.

He hadn't really seen it yesterday. He'd arrived in the late afternoon, when the building was all shadows and red lantern glow and the smell of other people's cooking. But now, with the tropical sun pouring through the central air well, The Lantern Hostel revealed itself.

The air well was the building's heart -- a rectangular shaft cut through the center of all three stories, open to the sky. Light fell through it in a solid column, so thick and golden it looked like something you could climb. It illuminated the interior courtyard below: potted ferns with leaves the size of dinner plates, a clothesline heavy with travelers' laundry -- underwear and sarongs and a pair of board shorts that might have been his -- and a mosaic tile bench, chipped and sun-bleached, where someone had left a paperback face-down and open. The walls around the air well were painted white, or had been once, but the tropics had softened them to a mottled cream, blooming with patches of green-grey mould that crept up from the ground floor like the building was slowly returning to jungle.

It was, Connor thought, reaching for the word -- *aesthetic*. His fingers twitched toward his phone before he remembered: three percent. He'd have to charge it before he could capture any of this. The thought caused a small, genuine pang, as though something didn't fully exist until he'd photographed it.

On the second-floor landing, between the bathroom and the stairwell, a section of the wall was different. The paint had peeled away in a rough rectangle, revealing something underneath: characters, painted directly onto the plaster in a faded red-brown. Japanese. Connor didn't read Japanese -- he didn't read anything that wasn't an Instagram caption -- but there was something about the precision of the brushstrokes that made him pause. They looked official. Military, maybe. A sign from the occupation era, from when this building had been something other than a hostel. Something with locked doors and sounds that didn't carry to the street.

He looked at the characters for three seconds, felt nothing he could identify, and went downstairs.

---

The kitchen was on the ground floor, tucked behind the common room, and Mama Siti was in it.

She was there the way a stove is there. Not waiting, not arriving, just *present* -- as though the kitchen had been built around her rather than the other way around. She stood at the counter in a floral housedress that looked older than Connor's parents, her grey hair tucked under a loose headscarf, stirring something in a blackened wok with the practiced economy of someone who had been making the same motion for longer than anyone still alive could confirm. The kitchen smelled extraordinary. Coconut and chili and something frying in hot oil, layered over the deeper base notes of rice steaming and pandan leaves and a sweetness he couldn't place.

Connor stood in the doorway. "Morning," he said, with what he considered charm.

Mama Siti didn't look up. She reached to her left, picked up a banana leaf that had already been arranged into a plate, and loaded it: a mound of rice so white it was almost blue, a splash of red sambal that glistened like lacquer, a scattering of tiny anchovies fried to bronze, a handful of peanuts, a wedge of hard-boiled egg, and a single slice of cucumber. She set it on the counter in front of Connor the way you'd set a bowl of water in front of a dog -- not with unkindness, but with the calm certainty that the creature would do exactly what you expected.

"Erm," Connor said. "How much is--"

"Lima ringgit." Five ringgit. She held up five fingers, then turned back to the wok. Her fingers were knotted and dark, the knuckles swollen in the way that hands get when they've been working for decades without rest.

Connor dug a crumpled blue note from his pocket and placed it on the counter. Mama Siti made it vanish without looking. He picked up the banana leaf plate -- it was warm, the rice still steaming -- and carried it to the communal table, a scarred wooden surface that looked like it had been repurposed from something larger. A dining table, maybe, or a door.

He sat down. He reached for his phone, remembered the battery, and swore under his breath. Three percent was enough for one photo if he was quick. He angled the banana leaf, tried to find the light from the air well, framed the shot --

"Makan dulu."

He looked up. Mama Siti was watching him from the kitchen doorway, arms folded. Her face was a landscape of lines, each one earned, and the expression on it was not quite disapproval and not quite pity. Somewhere between the two. A look that said she had seen this exact scene play out a hundred times, in this exact kitchen, and she already knew how it ended.

"Eat first," she said. "Phone later."

"Yeah, no, I was just going to--"

"*Makan.*"

Connor put the phone down.

He ate.

The nasi lemak was, without exaggeration, the best thing he had eaten in six countries of backpacking. The rice was impossibly fragrant, cooked in coconut milk until each grain was separate and slick and faintly sweet. The sambal hit him three seconds after the first bite -- a slow-building heat that started at the back of his tongue and crawled forward until his eyes watered. The anchovies were salty and crunchy, the peanuts grounding the whole thing with an earthy depth, and the egg was just an egg but somehow better than any egg he'd eaten before, as though Mama Siti had a personal arrangement with the chickens.

"This is incredible," he said, mouth full. "This is actually -- this is amazing."

Mama Siti said nothing. She stood in the kitchen doorway, watching him eat with an expression he couldn't read and wouldn't have tried to read even if he could. Something old and settled and final. The look of someone watching the tide come in, knowing what it would take when it went back out.

Connor didn't notice. He was thinking about how he'd describe the nasi lemak in an Instagram caption. *When the hostel auntie is a better chef than your whole country* with a fire emoji and a Malaysian flag. Something like that. Casual. Relatable. The kind of thing that got engagement.

He finished the plate, wiped the sambal from his lips with the back of his hand, and grinned at her. "Cheers, legend."

Mama Siti turned back to the kitchen. As she went, she said something in Malay, so quietly it might have been to herself, or to the building, or to no one at all.

Connor didn't ask for a translation.

---

Jake was waiting for him in the common room, sprawled across a wicker chair that creaked under his sunburned weight, scrolling his phone with the vacant attention of someone who had no destination and no urgency. He was wearing a backwards San Diego State cap and a shirt that said *I SURVIVED FULL MOON PARTY KOH PHANGAN* in neon lettering. His face lit up when he saw Connor.

"Dude! Finally. I've been waiting like an hour. Did you try the rice thing? The coconut rice?"

"Nasi lemak. And yeah, mate, it was unreal."

"Nah-see lem-ack," Jake repeated, getting it approximately right. "Dude, we should go explore. I heard Petaling Street is like, right outside. It's supposed to be this crazy market."

Connor looked at the common room. Mismatched furniture -- the wicker chair, a vinyl couch with a split down the middle leaking yellow foam, two plastic stools, a beanbag that had seen better decades. A bookshelf of abandoned novels, mostly thrillers and romance, their spines cracked and wavy from humidity. A wall-mounted TV showing CNN with the sound off, the ticker scrolling news that belonged to a world Connor had excused himself from. Above it all, ceiling fans rotated with the hypnotic slowness of things that have given up on urgency.

"Yeah," Connor said. "Let me charge my phone first. I need to film this."

He plugged in at the sole available outlet, the one near the reception desk that every guest in the hostel competed for like animals at a watering hole, and waited for the phone to climb to eleven percent. It would have to do. He had content to create.

---

Petaling Street hit them the way KL hit everyone who wasn't prepared for it: all at once, from every direction, with no mercy and no volume control.

They stepped out of the hostel's narrow doorway -- squeezed between the phone repair shop and the traditional Chinese medicine store, whose window displayed jars of dried things Connor didn't want to identify -- and into the street, and the street swallowed them whole.

The market ran the length of Petaling Street under a permanent canopy of green tarpaulins and corrugated metal that blocked the worst of the sun but trapped the heat like a greenhouse. Stalls lined both sides, stacked with goods that cascaded from tables onto the ground and up the walls: fake Louis Vuitton bags, fake Gucci wallets, fake Ray-Ban sunglasses, fake Beats headphones, fake everything, piled in bright cheap abundance. Between the stalls, in gaps that shouldn't have been wide enough for commerce, vendors had set up food carts -- woks hissing with oil, steamers billowing, grills smoking with satay sticks that sent plumes of charcoal-scented fog into the canopy. The smell was a wall: frying noodles, roasting peanuts, the sulfurous funk of open drains, incense from a temple somewhere nearby, diesel exhaust, and beneath it all, the sweet rot of overripe tropical fruit.

And the noise. Vendors calling out in Cantonese, Mandarin, Malay, English -- "Hey, you want watch? Good price!" "Best bag, real leather!" "Makan, makan, come eat!" -- layered over the rumble of traffic from the streets beyond, motorbike engines revving, a radio playing Cantopop from a hardware stall, the clatter of metal bowls and plastic chairs, the indecipherable hum of a thousand overlapping conversations. Bodies pressed in from all sides -- tourists with cameras, locals with shopping bags, children darting between legs, a man pushing a cart loaded with durian fruit that people stepped away from as if it were radioactive.

Connor raised his phone and pressed record.

"What's up, legends," he said to the camera, adopting the slightly louder, slightly more performative voice he used for content. "Day two in KL, and we're hitting up Petaling Street. This is the famous Chinatown market, and as you can see, it is absolutely *pumping*. Let's go find some bargains."

No one had asked for this. His 4,200 followers -- about five K, he'd tell you -- mostly scrolled past his stories without watching. But Connor filmed with the conviction of someone addressing a vast and hungry audience, panning the phone slowly across the market, zooming in on things that caught his eye, providing commentary that no one would hear.

"Look at this -- fake Rolexes, fake Nikes, fake everything. This is what I love about Asia, man. You can get anything for nothing."

Jake trailed behind him, equally awed but less inclined to narrate. He pointed at things and said "dude" and "no way" at intervals, which was his contribution to most conversations.

They stopped at a stall selling watches. The display was a glass case of imitation luxury, Rolexes and Omegas and Breitlings laid out on velvet in a way that was almost touching in its aspirational sincerity. The vendor, a Chinese Malaysian man in his fifties with reading glasses pushed up on his forehead and an expression of infinite patience, watched Connor approach.

"How much for this one?" Connor picked up a fake Submariner. It was surprisingly heavy.

"Eighty ringgit."

"Eighty? Mate, come on. I'll give you twenty."

The vendor's expression didn't change. "Sixty."

"Twenty-five."

"Fifty. Good price. Best quality."

Connor grinned the grin of someone who had watched three YouTube videos about haggling in Asian markets and now considered himself a master negotiator. "Thirty. Final offer. I'm doing you a favour, there's heaps of these stalls."

The vendor looked at Connor for a long moment. The glasses on his forehead caught the light. He said, in English so precise and clipped it could have cut glass: "Thirty ringgit. For a watch you'll lose in a swimming pool next week. Take it and please stop performing for your telephone."

Jake burst out laughing. Connor's grin faltered for exactly one second before reassembling itself. "Legend," he said, laying the thirty ringgit on the glass case. He strapped the watch to his wrist, held it up to the phone camera. "Just got a Rolex in KL for like seven bucks. This place is unreal."

They moved deeper into the market. Connor filmed everything. He filmed a woman making fresh popiah at her stall, her hands moving with mesmerizing speed, rolling the thin crepe around shredded jicama and peanuts. He didn't ask permission. The woman looked up, saw the phone, and turned her back. He filmed a display of traditional Chinese calligraphy brushes and asked the vendor, "Do you speak English?" The vendor, a woman in her thirties with a university lanyard still hanging from her bag, replied in English with a received pronunciation that made Connor's Australian drawl sound like he was speaking through a mouthful of gravel: "I have a degree in English literature from the University of Malaya. Would you like a recommendation? You seem like you'd enjoy Hemingway. He also mistook brevity for profundity."

Jake laughed so hard he choked on his own spit. Connor said "Sick burn, actually" and moved on, because nothing penetrated, nothing stuck, nothing altered the fundamental architecture of his certainty that the world was a playground built for his amusement.

They passed the Guan Di Temple. It rose from the street like something from a different century, which it was -- red pillars, gold trim, the deep green of glazed roof tiles, and above the entrance, a carved dragon that looked down at the market with an expression of magnificent indifference. Incense smoke drifted from the doorway, sweet and thick, and inside, Connor could see the dim glow of candles and the burnished gold of altar pieces.

"Sick," he said. "Let's check it out."

He walked straight for the entrance in his flip-flops. One foot was on the threshold when a hand caught his arm -- firm, not aggressive, but unmistakably a stop. An elderly Chinese man in a white undershirt, sitting on a plastic stool beside the entrance, shook his head and pointed at Connor's feet. Then at a rack of plastic sandal bags. Then at a sign, written in four languages, that said *PLEASE REMOVE SHOES BEFORE ENTERING*.

"Oh," Connor said. "Right. Yeah. Sorry, mate."

He kicked off his flip-flops, dropped them in a bag, and entered the temple barefoot. The stone floor was cool and smooth, worn by decades of feet that had entered with more reverence than his. The interior was dark after the market's glare, and the smoke from a forest of joss sticks turned the air into something you could almost chew. A massive statue of Guan Di -- the red-faced god of war and righteousness, though Connor didn't know that and wouldn't have been interested -- loomed at the far end, flanked by smaller figures and offerings of oranges and flowers.

Connor raised his phone and took a selfie. Flash on. In a temple.

Jake, to his credit, looked uncomfortable. "Dude, should you be doing that in here?"

"Relax, it's Asia. Everyone takes photos everywhere."

A woman praying at a side altar turned and looked at him. Her look was not the vendor's cutting wit or the calligraphy seller's dry dismissal. It was something quieter and harder to shrug off. Sadness, maybe. The sadness of watching someone walk through a sacred space without seeing it.

Connor didn't see it. He was checking the selfie. The lighting was good.

---

They emerged from the temple and followed their noses to a row of fruit stalls at the edge of the market, where the permanent canopy gave way to a strip of open sky and the sun fell on piles of rambutan, mangosteen, jackfruit, and -- unmistakable, even to someone who'd never encountered it before -- durian.

The smell arrived before the visual. It was a smell that seemed to have ambitions beyond the olfactory, reaching for something truly transcendent in its awfulness -- a concentrated essence of rotting onion, turpentine, old gym sock, and an indefinable sweetness that somehow made the whole thing worse. The durians sat in their spiky green husks, looking like medieval weapons designed by someone with a cruel sense of humour, and the vendor -- a wiry man in a singlet who clearly had no functioning sense of smell -- was hacking one open with a machete.

"Oh my god," Jake said, pulling his shirt over his nose. "What IS that?"

"Durian, bro," Connor said, already filming. "King of fruits. You've got to try it when you're in Southeast Asia. It's like a rite of passage."

He had never tried it. He had seen Instagram posts about trying it. This was functionally the same thing in Connor's epistemology.

"How much?" he asked the vendor, pointing at the open durian.

"Ten ringgit."

Connor paid without bargaining -- the smell had disabled his negotiation instincts -- and the vendor scooped out a segment of the custard-yellow flesh and placed it on a plastic plate. It sat there, glistening, looking like something that had already been eaten once. The smell, freed from the husk, intensified to the point where nearby shoppers visibly adjusted their trajectories.

"This is going to be content gold," Connor told Jake. "Film me."

He handed Jake his phone. Jake held it up with one hand, the other pinching his nose shut. Connor picked up the durian segment, mugged for the camera, and bit into it.

The first thing was the texture -- soft, almost gelatinous, with the consistency of a custard that had lost the will to live. It coated the inside of his mouth immediately, clinging to his teeth, his tongue, the roof of his mouth, as though it were trying to colonize him. Then the flavour arrived. It was not one flavour but several, in rapid and contradictory succession: sweet, then savory, then something that tasted like caramelized onion mixed with vanilla ice cream, then a garlicky aftertaste that had no business being in a fruit, and through all of it, the *smell*, which was now coming from inside him, rising through his sinuses and establishing a permanent camp behind his eyes.

Connor's face went through a full cycle of human emotion in about four seconds. Surprise. Confusion. Dawning horror. A brief, wild-eyed moment of wondering if this was poisonous. And then, inevitably, the gag.

He lurched forward, one hand on his knee, the other still holding the half-eaten durian segment, and produced a sound that was somewhere between a cough, a retch, and a prayer. He didn't actually vomit -- he would later insist on this, on his Instagram story, with the passion of someone defending a war record -- but it was a near thing. His body convulsed. His eyes streamed. A small, involuntary whimper escaped his lips.

Jake, filming, was laughing so hard that the footage would be unusable -- just shaking and wheezing and Jake's voice saying "dude -- dude -- DUDE --" between gasps.

The durian vendor watched with the detached amusement of a man who had seen this performance approximately eight thousand times. He leaned against his stall, arms crossed, and when Connor finally straightened up, red-faced and watery-eyed, the vendor offered him a single piece of practical advice.

"Next time, don't breathe through nose."

"Cheers," Connor croaked. He looked at the durian segment in his hand, looked at the camera, and -- because content was content -- took another bite. This time he chewed with his mouth open, breathing through his mouth like a drowning man, and managed to swallow. He gave the camera a thumbs-up with the expression of someone who has just been informed of a family death.

"That," he said, "is an acquired taste."

The vendor said nothing. He was already serving the next customer, a local woman who ate her durian with the relaxed pleasure of someone enjoying ice cream on a park bench.

---

The hawker center was two streets behind Petaling Street, down a narrow lane that smelled of drains and jasmine, in a covered open-air space filled with plastic tables and metal stools that had been welded together in configurations that discouraged comfort. The lunch rush was on. Every table was occupied by people eating with the focused intensity that Malaysians brought to food -- heads down, elbows out, the conversation secondary to the meal.

Connor and Jake found a table with two empty spots at the end, across from someone who was already sitting there. They sat down without asking, because that was how hawker centers worked -- Connor knew this from a YouTube travel channel, one of the few pieces of cultural research he'd ever conducted.

The person across from them was a woman. She was young -- mid-twenties, Connor estimated -- with dark skin and long black hair pulled into a practical braid that hung over one shoulder. She wore round glasses, the kind that looked like they'd been chosen for function rather than fashion, and a plain grey T-shirt and jeans. No jewelry. No visible brand logos. No effort, Connor thought, to project a curated identity -- which was, in his worldview, almost as baffling as the durian.

She was reading a book. Not a phone, not a Kindle -- an actual physical book, a Lonely Planet guide so battered it was held together with rubber bands. She was eating roti canai with one hand and turning pages with the other, her eyes tracking lines of text with the focused attention of someone used to processing large volumes of information. A cup of teh tarik sat at her elbow, milky and sweet-smelling, half-finished.

Connor noticed her immediately, because Connor always noticed women, the way a satellite dish always points at the sky. But there was something else -- something about the self-sufficiency of the scene, the completeness of a person who needed nothing beyond a book and a meal and a table. She looked like she belonged here, even though she clearly wasn't local. She looked like she'd done her homework.

"That any good?" Connor asked, nodding at the roti canai.

She looked up. Brown eyes behind the round glasses, sharp and assessing. She took him in -- the man-bun, the singlet, the fake Rolex, the flip-flops, the phone lying on the table like an extra organ -- and something moved behind her expression. Not interest. Not disinterest. Categorization.

"It's excellent," she said. London accent, precise, the vowels clipped in a way that made Connor's Australian sound like it was melting. "The dhal is particularly good here. They use fresh curry leaves."

"Sick. I'll get some. I'm Connor, by the way. This is Jake."

"Priya," she said, and went back to her book.

Connor was not deterred by disinterest. Connor was never deterred by disinterest. Disinterest was, in his experience, just interest that hadn't been properly introduced to his personality.

"What are you reading? Like, I know it's a Lonely Planet, but what section?"

Priya pushed her glasses up her nose. "The legal section. Malaysian civil and criminal law."

Connor stared at her. Then he laughed -- a genuine, full-bodied laugh that turned heads at the next table. "You're actually reading the *rules section*? That's like reading the terms and conditions. Nobody does that."

"Everybody should do that," Priya said, without smiling. "Especially in a country where the legal system is significantly different from whatever you're used to."

"What are they going to do, arrest me for being too good-looking?"

She did smile then, despite herself. Just a flicker at the corner of her mouth, barely enough to register, but Connor saw it and felt the small, warm hit of dopamine that came from making a pretty girl crack. He leaned back in his chair, arms behind his head, the fake Rolex catching the light.

"Where are you from?" he asked.

"London."

"Travelling long?"

"Six weeks. I'm a medical student. This is my break before final year."

"A doctor! Legend. So you're on holiday and you're doing *homework*." He gestured at the guidebook. "That's dedication."

"It's common sense," Priya said. She turned the guidebook toward him, tapping a section of text. "Did you know that Malaysia has a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking? Not just dealing -- even carrying above certain amounts. Fifty grams of methamphetamine, for instance. That's less than the weight of a candy bar."

Connor's expression didn't change. He heard the words -- *mandatory death penalty* -- the way he heard all words that didn't directly relate to his immediate comfort: they entered his ears, grazed the surface of his brain, and slid off without leaving a mark.

"Heavy," he said. "You might want to tell that to the actual drug dealers though, not the tourists."

"Tourists get caught too. That's rather the point."

"Yeah, but--" He waved a hand, the universal gesture of someone dismissing information they haven't processed. "That's like, big-time dealer stuff. Cartels and all that. They're not going to hang some backpacker for having a good time."

Priya looked at him for a long moment. "You might want to read this section," she said, pushing the book slightly closer.

"Why? Are they going to arrest me for being too good-looking?" He said it again, grinning, because in Connor's world, a line that worked once would work forever.

"You already used that one," Priya said, but she was smiling now, properly, the kind of smile that acknowledged the joke was terrible while conceding that the delivery had a certain brainless charm. She closed the guidebook and took a sip of her teh tarik. "Where are you staying?"

"The Lantern. In Chinatown. It's this old shophouse place, really cool."

"I know it. I'm staying there too. Dorm four."

"No way. I'm in three. We're practically neighbours."

"Practically."

Connor ordered roti canai from a passing hawker -- pointing at Priya's plate and holding up two fingers, because ordering by imitation was easier than learning words -- and when the food arrived, he ate it with the messy enthusiasm he brought to everything. Priya ate neatly, methodically, and asked him questions with the diagnostic precision of someone trained to take patient histories. Where was he from? (Melbourne.) How long had he been travelling? (Four years, on and off.) What did he do for work? (Digital consulting, very flexible, location-independent.) Had he been to KL before? (Nah, first time, just vibing.)

She didn't challenge his answers directly. She just listened with an attentiveness that Connor found flattering and slightly unnerving, as though she were running his responses through some internal diagnostic algorithm and noting the results without sharing them.

Jake, meanwhile, had ordered a plate of char kway teow and was eating it with the focused joy of a golden retriever encountering a steak. He contributed to the conversation at intervals -- "Dude, this is so good" and "Wait, you're going to be a doctor? That's sick" -- before returning to his noodles with the contentment of someone for whom the present moment was the only moment that existed.

"Your friend is having a good time," Priya observed.

"Jake's having the time of his life. Jake's always having the time of his life. It's his superpower."

"And yours?"

Connor thought about this for less than a second. "Being in the right place at the right time."

Priya said nothing to this, but she pushed her glasses up her nose -- the gesture Connor would come to learn meant she was filing something away for later examination -- and something in her expression shifted. Not suspicion. Not attraction. Something in between, something careful and curious and, beneath it all, concerned. As though she'd just heard a cough in a patient's chest and was deciding whether to order an X-ray.

---

They walked back toward the hostel in the early afternoon, the three of them, through the thinning market crowds and down the side streets where the tourist chaos of Petaling Street softened into something older and quieter. Here the shophouses leaned together over narrow lanes like old men sharing secrets, their facades layered with decades of paint and wire and air-conditioning units bolted to walls at precarious angles. Laundry hung from upper windows. A cat slept on a parked motorbike. The heat sat on everything like a physical weight.

It was in one of these side lanes, between a shuttered hardware store and a wall of peeling movie posters in Chinese, that Connor saw the graffiti.

It was written in black marker on a stretch of grey concrete wall, at about head height, in a hand that was neat and deliberate -- not a rushed tag, but something placed there with intention. Two words and a symbol:

**@HostelReaper**

Below the words, drawn with the same black marker, a small icon: a robed figure holding a scythe, rendered in a few simple lines but unmistakable. And beneath that, in smaller lettering:

*Check-in is optional. Check-out is not.*

Connor stopped. He raised his phone and photographed it. The composition was good -- the dark marker against the grey wall, the peeling posters in the background, the heat-shimmer in the air giving the whole thing a faintly hallucinatory quality.

"Sick street art," he said.

Jake leaned in. "What's a Hostel Reaper?"

Connor shrugged. "Probably some band or something. Or like, a travel account. There's heaps of these edgy backpacker brands."

Priya had stopped a few steps ahead and was looking back at them. She looked at the graffiti. She didn't take a photo. She adjusted her glasses and said nothing, but her eyes stayed on the words a beat longer than Connor's had.

They walked on. The graffiti stayed. The afternoon heat pressed down on the lane, and the small reaper figure stared out from the wall with the patient attention of something that had all the time in the world, because it did.

---

The common room of The Lantern Hostel was cooler than the street but not by much. The ceiling fans turned with their eternal reluctance, pushing the humid air around in slow circles that accomplished nothing but the illusion of effort. CNN murmured from the wall-mounted TV. The bookshelf of abandoned novels -- their spines warped, their pages thick with absorbed moisture -- stood against the far wall like a monument to every traveler who had ever left something behind.

Priya settled into the vinyl couch with her guidebook, folding her legs beneath her and propping the battered Lonely Planet against her knee. She was already lost in it before Connor and Jake had finished kicking off their flip-flops. She read the way some people meditate: fully, completely, as though the rest of the room had been dimmed to nothing.

Connor sat in the wicker chair, his phone charging at the outlet by reception, and scrolled through the photos from the day. The market stalls. The fake Rolex on his wrist. The durian selfie -- his face red, eyes streaming, a comedy of suffering that would get more engagement than anything genuine ever could. The calligraphy brushes. The temple. The roti canai. The graffiti.

He was curating the day into a story that bore an approximate relationship to the day he'd actually had. The vendors' cutting English became "hilarious locals." The temple became "incredible vibes." The durian became "I nearly died lol." The girl with the guidebook became -- he wasn't sure yet. He didn't post about girls he'd just met. That was a later move, a week-two move, when the story had developed enough to be captioned.

His phone buzzed. A text message, not a notification. From Felix.

*Free tonight? Got something fun planned.*

Connor looked at the message. He looked at Priya, who was curled on the couch with her guidebook, the afternoon light from the air well falling across her in a warm stripe, turning the pages gold. She was reading with her lips slightly parted, the way people do when they're genuinely absorbed, and her braid had come partially undone, dark hair falling across her face. She pushed it back absently. She didn't look up.

Connor looked at his phone.

He typed a thumbs-up emoji and hit send.

He put the phone down and leaned back in the wicker chair, which creaked under him like the building sighing. On the TV, CNN was showing something about trade agreements. The ceiling fans turned. From the kitchen, the distant sound of Mama Siti washing pans, a rhythmic clang that sounded almost like a bell, or a warning.

Priya looked up from her guidebook. She'd caught something -- not the text, she was too far away for that, but something in his posture, the small shift in his body language when the message arrived. The way he'd leaned forward, then leaned back. The way his thumb had moved with a decisiveness the rest of him rarely showed.

"Who's that?" she asked.

"Just a mate," Connor said. "The German."

Something crossed Priya's face. Not suspicion -- the architecture of suspicion hadn't been built yet, there were no foundations, no framework, just an empty lot where something would eventually be constructed. What crossed her face was something earlier and smaller: attention. The slight narrowing of the eyes, the fractional tilt of the head, the medical student's instinct for symptoms that didn't quite add up. She looked at Connor, and Connor looked back at her, and for a moment the common room was very quiet except for the fans and the TV and Mama Siti's pans.

Then Priya smiled. "Have fun," she said, and went back to her book.

Connor smiled too. He stretched, laced his fingers behind his head, and watched the ceiling fans turn. Through the air well above, the sky was clouding over -- the afternoon thunderstorm building, the light shifting from gold to grey, the humidity thickening toward the downpour that came every day at this hour in this city, as regular and as indifferent as the law.

His phone sat on the arm of the chair, screen dark, the thumbs-up emoji already delivered, already read, already part of a sequence that would not stop until it reached its conclusion.

Outside, thunder rolled across the Kuala Lumpur skyline like a door closing.
# Chapter 4: The Crew

The rooftop of The Lantern Hostel had no business being anyone's idea of a good time. Five plastic chairs arrayed around a plywood table held steady by a folded beer coaster. A clothesline sagged between two poles, heavy with the damp ghosts of traveler laundry: elephant-print harem pants, a sports bra faded to the color of dishwater, someone's cargo shorts pinned by a single clip and rotating slowly like a weathervane nobody needed. The railing was a waist-high strip of corrugated zinc that inspired confidence in absolutely no one.

But the view.

The Petronas Towers framed between shophouse roofs and a chaos of electrical wire so dense it looked like the city's nervous system turned inside out. The towers stood silver and alien against the dark, twin needles of money and ambition punching through the orange murk of light pollution. Below, Petaling Street hummed -- motorbike engines, hawker vendors, the bass-note vibrations from Changkat three blocks east. The air was warm and thick and smelled of exhaust and incense and, beneath that, the sulfurous breath of the open drains.

Connor leaned against the zinc railing with a Tiger beer sweating in his hand and thought: *This is going on the grid.*

He held up his phone and framed the shot -- the towers between the wires, the red glow of the hostel's lanterns bleeding up from below. He took four photos, selected the best, applied a filter that deepened the reds and cooled the sky to a moody indigo, and saved it to drafts. Caption later. Something about perspective. His 4,200 followers -- about five K, if anyone asked -- would eat it up.

"Connor! My man!"

Jake Porter emerged through the rooftop access door like a golden retriever who'd heard a treat bag rustle. Backwards cap, surf brand singlet stretched across his stocky sunburned frame, a grin so wide it was almost a medical condition. He was carrying two cans of Tiger in each hand, pressed against his chest like he was rescuing them from a building fire.

"Dude, Felix said drinks are on the roof. I brought supplies."

"Legend," Connor said. Jake was exactly the kind of person Connor understood on a cellular level: easygoing, up for anything, never asking difficult questions. They'd bonded in under twenty minutes on Connor's first night, and in the hostel economy of instant friendship, that was practically a blood oath.

Jake dropped into a plastic chair that screamed under his weight and cracked a Tiger with practiced ceremony. "So Felix organized this whole thing? Like, he just decided we're all going out?"

"That's Felix, mate. Man's a social architect."

"A what?"

"He just -- he makes things happen. You know? Some people talk about doing stuff, Felix just does it."

Jake nodded with the gravity of someone receiving wisdom. "Totally. He's like, the guy, you know? Every hostel has one."

They clinked cans. The beer was lukewarm but Connor didn't care. The night was happening. He could feel it the way you feel weather coming in -- a charge in the air, a loosening of constraints, the city below rearranging itself into possibility.

Priya arrived next, and Connor could tell from the way she climbed through the access door that she'd already had the argument with herself and lost.

She was dressed practically, as always -- jeans rolled at the ankle, a plain navy top, trainers that had actually been laced properly. Her battered Lonely Planet guide was not in evidence, which for Priya constituted going wild. She pushed her round glasses up her nose and surveyed the rooftop with the expression of someone inspecting a crime scene.

"I can only stay for one drink," she announced to no one in particular. "I have an early start tomorrow. I'm doing the Batu Caves at seven."

"Priya!" Connor stood, spread his arms. "You came! See, I told Jake you'd come."

"You said she wouldn't," Jake said.

"I said she *might* not, which is basically the same as saying she would. Sit down. Drink. The Batu Caves aren't going anywhere -- they've been there for, what, four hundred million years?"

"The limestone, yes. The temples are about a hundred and forty years old." She sat in the plastic chair Connor pulled out for her, accepted the beer he pressed into her hand with minimal resistance. "One drink."

"One drink," Connor agreed, already knowing it would be more.

A Swedish couple appeared -- Astrid and Erik, tall and blonde and so symmetrically attractive they looked like they'd been cast by a Scandinavian tourism board. Then Min-ho, a Korean guy from Dorm 1 who spoke minimal English but communicated entirely through enthusiastic thumbs-ups and an encyclopedic knowledge of drinking games. The rooftop filled with voices and the percussion of cracking cans and the warm, electric hum of people who'd known each other for less than forty-eight hours but were, by the transient mathematics of hostel life, already a family.

Connor noticed the woman sitting apart.

She was on the far side of the rooftop, perched on a plastic crate near the clothesline. Short. Athletic. Hair cropped close to her skull, the tips dyed a dark red that caught the lantern light like embers. Multiple piercings climbed the cartilage of her left ear -- silver studs and tiny hoops, precise as Morse code. In her hands was a camera that was not a tourist's camera. Heavy, black, professional-grade -- the kind of equipment that cost more than Connor's entire travel fund.

"Who's that?" he asked Jake.

"Oh, her? That's Tomoko. Japanese. She's in the premium dorm, I think. Keeps to herself."

Connor watched her for a moment. She moved the camera with an economy of motion that suggested thousands of hours of practice -- no wasted gestures, no fumbling with settings, just the smooth pivot of someone who saw the world through a viewfinder as naturally as breathing.

He walked over, beer in hand, smile deployed.

"Hey! I'm Connor. You're Tomoko, yeah?"

She lowered the camera. Her eyes were dark, steady, weighted -- the eyes of someone who had learned to see things other people chose not to see.

"Yes."

"Sick camera. You a photographer?"

"Photojournalist."

"Oh, rad. Like, for a magazine?"

"Sometimes."

Connor waited for her to elaborate. She didn't.

"Cool, well -- we're all heading out to Changkat tonight. You should come. Felix is organizing it. He knows all the spots."

At the name Felix, something shifted in her expression. Not quite a flinch. More like a door closing behind a window -- the light changed but you couldn't say exactly how.

"The German," she said.

"Yeah. You've met him?"

"Briefly."

"He's a legend. The guy knows everyone in KL."

Tomoko looked at him with an expression he couldn't read. "Have a good night, Connor."

She raised the camera back to her eye and turned toward the skyline. Connor stood there for a moment, dismissed, then walked back to the group with a shrug.

"She's a bit intense," he told Jake.

"Right? I tried to talk to her about surfing and she just, like, looked at me."

*Unfriendly,* Connor decided, and the word slotted neatly into his mental filing system. Friendly. Unfriendly. Useful. Not useful. Fun. Not fun. Tomoko: not fun. He put her away and opened another beer.

Felix arrived at nine o'clock, and it was like the volume on the rooftop went up.

He came through the access door with a bottle of duty-free Hendrick's gin in one hand and a bag of limes in the other, and the rooftop rearranged itself around him like metal filings around a magnet. White linen shirt that should have been wrinkled but wasn't. Dark linen shorts. Leather sandals. When the red lantern light hit the thin scar on his left eyebrow it gave him the faintest suggestion of danger, which is to say, exactly the right amount.

"Good evening, everyone," Felix said, and he said it the way he said everything -- calmly, warmly, with the soft German accent rounding the consonants into something musical. "Gin and tonics on me. Who has ice?"

Nobody had ice. This didn't matter. Felix produced a plastic bag of ice cubes from behind his back like a stage magician and the rooftop erupted -- the full-throated cheer of people who are already two beers in and have just been promised free spirits.

He made the drinks himself, slicing limes with a Swiss Army knife, remembering everyone's name as he handed them their glasses. "Priya, a little less tonic? Jake, extra lime for you. Astrid, Erik -- skol. Min-ho, I added some cucumber."

*He remembers everything,* Connor thought. *Everyone's name, everyone's preference. That's a superpower.*

When Felix reached Connor, he poured a generous gin with the ease of a man who had never checked a price tag. "Connor. Ready for tonight?"

"Born ready, mate."

"I know a place on Changkat. Rooftop bar, fourth floor, best view of the city. The owner owes me a favor." He said this casually, like it was nothing, like everyone had bar owners in Kuala Lumpur who owed them favors. "We start there. Then we see where the night takes us."

"That's the attitude."

Felix's smile widened fractionally. He leaned in, lowered his voice, though not low enough that it felt secretive -- just intimate. "I want you to have a good night, Connor. You deserve it. You've been working hard."

Connor had not been working hard at anything, unless drinking Tiger beers and filming Instagram stories qualified. But the flattery landed like a warm hand on his shoulder, and he felt -- genuinely felt -- that Felix saw something in him that other people missed. Something worth investing in.

From the far side of the rooftop, Tomoko watched over the top of her camera. The shutter clicked once, twice, and then she lowered the lens and watched with her own eyes. Her expression was unreadable.

Priya, near the clothesline, watched Felix too. She watched the way he distributed drinks and attention with the precision of someone dealing cards, the way each person leaned toward him, postures opening like flowers. She felt something she couldn't quite name: not jealousy, not suspicion exactly, but a dissonance, like a note played slightly flat in an otherwise perfect chord. Real generosity has friction -- awkwardness, miscalculation. Felix never miscalculated. Felix was frictionless.

She pushed her glasses up and took a sip of her drink, which was, in fact, exactly how she liked it.

---

Changkat Bukit Bintang hit Connor's senses like a slap.

The nightlife strip ran uphill through a corridor of converted shophouses, each one bleeding light and noise into the tropical night. Neon signs -- blue, pink, green, electric orange -- competed along facades draped with string lights. Bass lines from competing sound systems collided in the air, a dissonant heartbeat you felt in your sternum before you heard it. The smell was cocktail garnish and charcoal satay smoke and perfume and sweat. Bodies everywhere -- tourists, locals, expats -- all flowing in the same direction: further in, deeper, louder.

"This," Connor said, walking backward so he could film the street on his phone, "is absolutely mental."

He was already recording. The Instagram story would be iconic: neon-soaked street, bass thumping, Connor's face appearing in frame with a grin that said *are you seeing this?* He added a location tag and a caption: "Tuesday night in KL hits different." He didn't mention it was Wednesday.

Felix led them up the street like a man who owned it, past the first three bars without a glance, past the touts offering two-for-one cocktails, past a bouncer at a reggae bar who called out "Welcome, welcome!" to anyone with a pulse. At a narrow doorway between a Thai restaurant and a cocktail bar, he spoke to a man in a black polo shirt. The man looked at Felix, nodded, and unclipped the velvet rope.

"VIP entrance," Felix said. "Elevator to the roof."

They arrived at a rooftop bar that was everything The Lantern's rooftop was not. Real furniture. Actual cocktails. A DJ playing deep house. The Petronas Towers close enough that their spire-points seemed to scratch the low clouds, lit from within like the bones of something luminous.

"Oh my God," Priya said, and she said it without irony.

Felix guided them to the best table and ordered a round. The cocktails arrived with elaborate garnishes: kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass stalks, thin slices of torch ginger flower. This was RM45 a drink. Connor did the math and then immediately stopped doing the math.

"To the crew," Felix said, raising his glass. The group repeated it: the crew. Connor clinked his glass against Priya's and caught her eye and felt the night rearrange itself around them.

They moved through Changkat the way Felix moved through everything: smoothly, inevitably. A cocktail bar in a converted colonial house. A live music venue where a Filipino cover band played "Hotel California" with more conviction than the Eagles ever had. A hole-in-the-wall club where the DJ played Afrobeats and the dance floor was so packed you moved by consensus rather than choice.

At each stop, Felix knew someone. The bartender at the cocktail bar -- "Felix! Long time, brother!" -- poured extra-strong drinks and waved away his money (Felix left a crisp RM50 note under his glass anyway, precise and uncreased). The doorman at the club put them at the front of the line with a handshake that lingered. A waitress at the live music venue brought complimentary satay and whispered something in Felix's ear that made him smile.

Connor noticed. He noticed Felix paid for everything in cash -- crisp ringgit notes in denominations that suggested either a very good ATM or a very different source. Never a card. Never a bill. Never a hesitation. The man moved through the financial world the way water moves through rock: around every obstacle, leaving no trace.

*Where does his money come from?*

The thought surfaced and submerged, drowned by the next drink, the bass drop, Jake attempting to moonwalk and wiping out into a group of German tourists who turned out to be from Felix's hometown and suddenly there were shots being ordered and Connor was filming it all, phone held high, capturing chaos for the grid.

His Instagram story by midnight was nine slides long. A neon sign. A cocktail close-up. Connor and Jake with their arms around each other, mouths open in a synchronised shout. The Petronas Towers from the rooftop bar. A blurred dance floor. Each one captioned with performative casualness: "KL nightlife is no joke," "This crew tho," "If you know, you know."

Nobody back home knew. That was the point. The stories existed to create envy in people who would never be here, doing this, living like this. Connor was curating a life, frame by frame, and the fact that he was three months behind on his credit card and his "digital nomad" income last month totaled $47 AUD was a detail that existed in a different file, one he kept closed.

Priya loosened up around the third bar. The gin had softened the edges of her caution and the music had found its way past her resistance. She danced -- self-conscious at first, then less so, then not at all. On the packed floor of the Afrobeats club she moved with a natural rhythm that surprised Connor, and when he danced toward her she didn't move away. They danced together in the crush of bodies, laughing at nothing, at the absurdity of being here, at the heat that prickled their skin, at the sheer volume of being alive in a city that didn't know their names.

There was a moment -- brief, genuine -- where their faces were close and the laughter stopped and something else was there. Not lust, not yet, but recognition. Priya's eyes behind her glasses, dark and clear and seeing him.

Then Jake crashed between them with a bucket of beer from a street vendor and the moment dissolved, and Connor thought: *This is the content. This is the story I came here to live.*

At the bar, Felix watched them. His gin and tonic was barely touched. His face, when the strobe lights caught it, was difficult to categorize. Not happiness, though it neighbored happiness. Not predatory, though it bordered on assessment. The expression of a chess player watching pieces move to positions he'd anticipated three moves ago.

He caught the bartender's eye. Another round. The crisp RM50 notes appeared and disappeared.

---

By one-thirty, Connor had spent RM250.

He knew this because he'd checked his banking app in the bathroom of the third or fourth bar, forehead against cool tile while the room performed a slow rotation around him. The number was smaller than it should have been, and for a moment the pleasant fog of alcohol thinned and he saw the mathematics of his life with horrible clarity.

Current balance: RM1,847. Roughly $580 AUD. His parents' next deposit was ten days away. At this rate he'd be broke in less than two weeks.

He closed the app. Opened Instagram. Forty-three likes on his stories. Three new followers, two of them bots.

*She'll be right. Something will come up.*

The night fractured after two AM. The Swedes peeled away with polite European goodbyes, their arms around each other's waists. Min-ho had vanished into a group of Korean travelers. Jake was at the end of the bar, deep in conversation with a British girl named Gemma or Jemma who was traveling alone and had the bright, open face of someone who hadn't yet learned that Jake's stories about surfing Pipeline were exaggerated by a factor of roughly ten.

Priya had found Connor in the crowd, put her hand on his arm, leaned close to his ear: "I'm going. Early start. Don't do anything stupid." She'd lingered long enough for him to feel the warmth of her breath, the faint trace of her perfume cutting through the smoke and sweat, and then she was gone, and the space she'd occupied felt briefly colder.

Which left Connor and Felix.

They ended up at a rooftop bar four stories above Changkat, a place you had to know existed. Unmarked door, staircase that smelled of concrete dust. But the bar was open-air, low couches and candles in glass jars, the Petronas Towers close enough to see the skybridge connecting them, lit from within, a bridge between two pillars of money.

Felix ordered two whiskeys. They arrived in heavy tumblers with a single ice sphere.

"You had a good night, Connor," Felix said. It wasn't a question.

"Mate, that was one of the best nights of my life. And I've had some big ones. There was this one time in Koh Phangan--"

"But you're not really here for parties, are you?"

Connor paused, his drink halfway to his mouth. "What do you mean?"

Felix gazed out at the towers. "Most backpackers come to Asia to escape," he said. "But they bring their whole world with them. Their rules. Their fears. Their need to turn everything into a photograph." He glanced at Connor's phone. "They never actually leave home."

"I mean, yeah. I've seen that. Definitely."

"The ones who sit in Western cafes, eating Western food, talking to other Western people. They fly ten thousand kilometers to re-create the life they had. They change the backdrop but they keep the frame."

Connor nodded, though he wasn't entirely sure which side of that equation he was on. "Totally. That's what I always say."

Felix turned to look at him. The scar on his eyebrow caught the light. "You're different, Connor. You're adaptable. Most people say they want freedom but what they really want is permission. You don't need that. I noticed it the first night we talked."

The whiskey was warm in Connor's chest and the compliment was warmer. Felix had a way of articulating things Connor felt about himself but couldn't quite express. It was like having a mirror that showed not your reflection but your best self.

"I've been on the road for four years," Connor said. "Not a gap year. Four actual years. The only way to do it is to let go. Stop planning. Just let the next thing happen."

"Exactly." Felix's voice was soft. "And the next thing always happens, doesn't it?"

"Always."

They drank. The city below was a river of light and exhaust and the distant sound of a hundred different musics playing simultaneously. Somewhere a motorcycle engine whined. A siren rose and fell. The humidity sat on Connor's skin like a second shirt.

"I should head back," Connor said, and reached for his phone. He opened the banking app out of the automatic masochism of someone who already knew what the number would say. The screen glowed in the dark. The number stared at him.

RM1,847. And he'd been drinking since eight.

No. He refreshed. RM1,597. The pending transactions had posted. RM250 gone in a single night. A night that had felt like freedom and looked, on his banking app, like a countdown.

He must have made a face, because Felix said: "Money problems?"

Connor locked his phone. "Nah. All good, mate. Just -- doing the maths."

"The maths are never kind at this hour."

"She'll be right. I've got some freelance stuff coming in."

He didn't have any freelance stuff coming in. His one client -- a surf shop in Torquay that paid him $150 a month to manage their Instagram -- had emailed last week asking if he could "do more for the same rate." He hadn't replied. He wasn't going to reply.

Felix sipped his whiskey. He let the silence do its work -- and Felix was good at silence, Connor noticed, the way some people are good at music. He wielded it. The candle between them flickered in a breeze that carried the smell of charcoal and jasmine from the street below.

"I meant what I said about the logistics work," Felix said, his tone conversational, the same tone he'd use to recommend a restaurant. "RM200 for twenty minutes. That was a real offer, Connor."

"Yeah, no, I remember. What exactly--"

"Simple courier work. Import consulting. Documents, electronics samples. I have a driver but some contacts prefer a friendly face." He smiled. "You have a very friendly face."

"RM200 for twenty minutes."

"Sometimes less. You could do it every day. That's twelve hundred a week, more than your hostel costs."

The numbers arranged themselves with the seductive clarity of alcohol and desperation. RM1,200 a week. More than his parents sent him monthly. Staying in KL for months. Never checking his banking app at two AM and feeling the floor tilt.

"I mean," Connor said, "that sounds..."

"Think about it." Felix stood, left two RM50 notes on the table -- more than the bill required -- and buttoned his linen shirt at the cuff with the precision of a man who attended to details the way other people attended to breathing. "No pressure. But you know where to find me."

He offered his hand. Connor shook it. Felix's grip was dry and firm and lasted exactly the right amount of time.

"Good night, Connor."

"Night, mate."

Felix left. Connor finished his whiskey and watched the Petronas Towers standing in the dark like a challenge, or a promise, or a headstone for something that hadn't died yet.

---

The common room of The Lantern Hostel at three AM was a place of residual warmth and abandoned intention. Mismatched furniture casting crooked shadows under the single fluorescent tube Razak kept on all night. The bookshelf of abandoned novels -- dog-eared Lonely Planets, water-damaged thrillers, a copy of *Shantaram* so swollen with humidity it looked pregnant. The ancient Dell humming in the corner like something dreaming.

Tomoko Sato sat cross-legged on the couch with her laptop, uploading photographs. The Nikon D850's SD card held 847 images, already culled to sixty-three in her head. Tomoko did not take photographs indiscriminately. Every frame was a decision.

The images scrolled: the rooftop, the lantern glow, Changkat in neon excess. Good images. Professional. The kind that would make her editor at The Guardian nod.

But she wasn't looking for those.

She scrolled past landscapes and street scenes until she found the sequence from the first bar. She'd been at the edge of the group, camera on the table, shooting through the gap between a candle and a drink menu.

She found the frame.

Felix and Connor. Felix's hand on Connor's shoulder -- a casual gesture, the kind that said *I'm your friend.* But to Tomoko's eye, not casual at all. Guiding. Directing. The way a handler touches an asset.

In the foreground, Connor leaned in, mouth open, his expression the open enthusiasm of a man who has found his favourite person in the room. Over Connor's shoulder, Felix was looking at him. And the expression on Felix's face was not friendship.

It was assessment.

The clinical attention of someone evaluating a tool. What is this person worth? What can this person carry? How far can this person be pushed before they break?

Tomoko zoomed in. Felix's eyes, caught by strobe light, were perfectly steady. No alcohol blur. Stone sober in a bar full of drunk people, watching Connor the way a spider watches a fly that has just touched the web.

She saved the photo to a separate folder on her desktop. The folder was labeled, in Japanese, with two characters that translated roughly to "watch closely." She opened a text file inside the folder. Three entries already -- notes from previous nights, logged with the precision of field reportage.

She typed:

*Night 4. The German. Changkat. Cash only, high denominations. Knows staff at multiple venues. Avoids cameras. Hand-on-shoulder with the Australian -- guided conversation, controlled body language. Expression when unobserved: evaluative, not social.*

She paused. Added:

*The Australian trusts him completely.*

She closed the laptop. Through the air well, the hostel breathed -- creaking wood, a cough from an upper-floor dorm.

She thought about saying something to Connor. She could show him the photograph. She could say: look at the way this man looks at you. Look at his eyes. But she had tried, on the rooftop, in the way she tried things -- economically, without force. She'd offered a door. He'd walked away and called her unfriendly, or something equivalent. She'd heard the dismissal in his tone the way she heard most things people tried to hide: clearly.

Tomoko had been a journalist long enough to know that people who don't want to see will not be shown. They will look at evidence and see coincidence. They will look at a man measuring them for a coffin and see a friend buying drinks.

She saved the file. Created a backup on her phone.

Then she went to bed.

---

Dorm 3 was dark and close and smelled of Tiger Balm and damp and the particular musk of six strangers sleeping in a room designed for two. The ceiling fan turned with its metronomic click -- *tick, tick, tick* -- stirring the air without cooling it. Through the narrow opening to the air well, the sounds of KL filtered in as a distant murmur: the city's breathing, its three AM pulse.

Connor climbed into Bed 7 with the careful deliberation of a man drunker than he wants to admit. Flip-flops and singlet removed; the board shorts stayed because the coordination required exceeded his operational capacity. The thin mattress -- vinyl-covered foam, body-temperature, sticky against his bare back -- received him with indifferent resignation.

The room spun. Not violently, not the full carousel of real drunkenness, but the slow tilt of a ship in a mild swell. He closed his eyes and opened them again. The underside of the bunk above him was covered in stickers -- surf brands, band logos, a peeling Che Guevara, a scratched-off Hostelworld badge. In the dark they were just shapes, hieroglyphics left by previous occupants in a language of allegiance and memory.

*Tick, tick, tick.* The ceiling fan.

He picked up his phone. The screen brightness hit his eyes like a flash and he fumbled to dim it. Three seventeen AM. A WhatsApp from Jake: "dude gemma is so cool we're at some after party where are you." A missed call from his sister Megan. He would not return it.

He opened his banking app.

RM1,597.

The number sat on the screen with the blunt authority of a verdict. He stared at it. Eleven days until his parents' deposit. Eleven days of hostel fees (RM495), food (RM300 minimum, more if he kept eating out), transport, water, the occasional beer. He was RM200 short at a minimum, and that was if he ate instant noodles and drank nothing and went nowhere and became, effectively, the kind of traveler he despised: the one counting coins and choosing between lunch and a museum ticket.

He thought about Felix's offer.

RM200. Twenty minutes. The framing made sense in the way things make sense at three AM when you're drunk and broke and the alternative is admitting that the entire architecture of your life is built on parental subsidy and willful ignorance.

He could do that every day and never worry about money again. He could stay in KL for months. Self-funded, self-sufficient, free in the way that mattered. Free in the way that his parents' monthly deposit, with its invisible string of guilt, could never make him.

He opened WhatsApp. Found Felix's name. Typed:

*That logistics thing.*

Three dots blinked. The cursor waited.

He looked at the words. They sat in the text field like a dare.

It was an opening, not a commitment. He could send it and see what Felix said and then decide. No pressure. Just information gathering. The kind of thing a smart person would do.

He put his phone down.

He picked it up again.

*That logistics thing.*

His thumb hovered over the send arrow. The blue triangle pointed right, pointing forward, pointing toward something that had no name yet but already had momentum.

He didn't send it.

But he didn't delete it either.

He put the phone face-down on the mattress. His hand found the edge of his travel towel, bunched at the foot of the bed -- the bright blue Sea to Summit microfiber he'd bought four years ago on Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, two days before his first flight to Bali. Twelve countries. It smelled of sunscreen and the South China Sea. He pulled it over his chest like a thin, inadequate blanket.

The ceiling fan clicked. *Tick, tick, tick.*

Through the air well, Kuala Lumpur hummed: distant, patient, indifferent. A city that would not notice if Connor James Briggs stayed or left or lived or died.

He closed his eyes. The room swayed. The unsent message waited.

The decision was already made. He just hadn't admitted it yet.
# Chapter 5: Content Creator

---

The laptop screen had gone to sleep again. Connor tapped the trackpad, watched the login prompt bloom to life, and typed his password -- *balivibes69* -- with the grim efficiency of a man performing surgery on his own ambitions. The screen unlocked to reveal exactly what he'd left twenty minutes ago: an open Google Doc with three lines of text, an Instagram scheduling dashboard, and seventeen browser tabs he would never revisit.

The cafe was called Grind Culture. Of course it was. It occupied the ground floor of a pre-war shophouse on Jalan Sultan, two streets over from The Lantern, and it had been gutted and rebuilt in the image of every third-wave coffee temple from Brooklyn to Byron Bay. Exposed brick. Edison bulbs. A chalkboard menu in deliberately imperfect handwriting. Pour-over stations gleaming like laboratory equipment. The whole place smelled of single-origin Sumatran and the unspoken agreement that everyone here was doing something important on their MacBooks.

He adjusted his man-bun, sipped his flat white -- RM14, which his brain helpfully converted to about five Australian dollars, which his bank balance helpfully pointed out he didn't have -- and surveyed the room.

Six other laptops open. Three looked like genuine developers, deep in code, headphones on, the thousand-yard stare of people wrestling with something that would actually compile. One was a girl with a ring light clipped to her screen, recording a whispered podcast into her AirPods. One was typing what appeared to be an actual manuscript. And one -- the only one who met Connor's gaze -- was watching a cooking video with the sound off.

*Probably actually working*, Connor thought, casting his eyes over the developers. *Mugs.*

He returned to the Google Doc. The three lines read:

> Hey legends!! Your weekend vibes are about to get INSANE. New boards dropping next week from our mates at Pacific Soul -- crafted by shapers who live and breathe the Byron break. Link in bio for 10% off. Catch the wave or watch it from shore. Your call.

That was Caption One. For Pacific Soul Surf Co. of Byron Bay, New South Wales, Australia. His one client. His single, solitary source of earned income. One hundred and fifty American dollars a month for three Instagram posts a week, scheduled in advance, each one requiring approximately four minutes of effort and a stock photo Connor pulled from Unsplash with "surf lifestyle" in the search bar.

He'd told Pacific Soul he was a "content strategist" with "a network of over five thousand engaged followers." Three lies wrapped in marketing jargon, offered with a confidence that functioned exactly like competence until someone checked. No one ever checked. The whole infrastructure ran on trust and vibes.

Connor copied Caption One into the scheduling dashboard, assigned it a stock photo of a blonde woman holding a surfboard at sunset, and set the publish time for 7 AM AEST.

Caption Two came faster:

> Monday doesn't have to be a wipeout. Grab your board, grab your crew, and ride into the new week like you mean it. Pacific Soul -- where every day is a swell day. #surflife #byronbay #pacificsoul #mondaymotivation

*Where every day is a swell day.* Christ. He was writing puns for a surf shop while the humidity of equatorial Southeast Asia liquefied his will to live. But it was technically work, in a technical sense, if you squinted.

Caption Three: something about life being too short, riding bad boards, chasing dreams. He didn't think about it. He published all three, closed the tab, and felt the warm glow of accomplishment that a man feels when he has performed the absolute minimum required to justify his existence. Three captions. Fifteen minutes. That was his work for the day.

Now came the real work. The Work of Connor.

He turned the laptop sideways, pulled his phone from his pocket, and photographed his flat white from above. Not right. The foam pattern -- some vaguely leaf-shaped thing the barista had scratched out -- was off-centre in the frame. He adjusted the cup a quarter turn. Shot again. Better. But the light was wrong. He shifted the laptop to create a negative space in the background, a clean wooden surface with the cafe's logo just visible on a napkin. Third shot.

That was the one.

He opened VSCO, applied a preset -- *C1, always C1, the thinking man's filter* -- and pulled the exposure up a touch. Warmed the tones. The flat white now looked like an artifact from a better life than the one he was actually living. He switched to Instagram, typed a caption:

> Office for the day. No walls, no ceiling, no limits. Just me, my laptop, and the best flat white in KL. This is what they don't tell you about the digital nomad life -- every day is different, every cafe is a new perspective.
>
> #digitalnomad #remotework #laptoplifestyle #kualalumpur #KL #coffeeshop #livingmybestlife #nooffice #workfromanywhere #flatwhite #cafecrawl #contentcreator

Twelve hashtags. Connor considered this restrained. He'd read somewhere that the algorithm preferred under fifteen. He posted.

Then he sat back and watched the likes trickle in. One. Two. A pause. Three. The dopamine was barely perceptible, the serotonin equivalent of licking the foil lid of a yoghurt container. But it was something. A pulse. A proof of life.

He checked his follower count: 4,207. Down three from yesterday. That was about five K, give or take. If anyone asked. Some of them were bots, and some of them were his mum's friends, and some of them were other digital nomads following him purely so he'd follow back, a daisy chain of mutual delusion stretching around the globe. But five K sounded like a man with a brand.

He opened LinkedIn on a whim. Scrolled past posts from people his age in Melbourne -- someone promoted to Associate Director, someone launching a startup, a girl from school celebrating her third anniversary at Google. Connor's own profile listed him as "Digital Nomad | Content Strategist | Global Citizen" and hadn't been updated in eleven months. He began drafting a thought-leadership post:

> The future of remote work isn't an office without walls. It's a mindset without borders. For the last four years, I've been living proof that you don't need a corner office or a zip code to build something meaningful. You just need wifi, a willingness to embrace uncertainty, and the

He stopped. The sentence had nowhere to go. He didn't know what you needed. He didn't know if he'd built anything meaningful. He didn't even know what the wifi password was this week. He closed LinkedIn and reopened Instagram and scrolled through other people's curated lives until the flat white went cold and the guilt became load-bearing.

The walk back to The Lantern took four minutes down Jalan Sultan to Petaling Street, past the textile shops and the traditional medicine stores. The heat had settled into its midday configuration -- not the morning heat, which was merely uncomfortable, but the lunchtime heat, which was a statement of intent. His singlet was soaked through before he'd gone half a block.

He passed Wei's shop. Phone repairs. A narrow glass frontage crammed with charging cables and screen protectors and handwritten signs in Mandarin and English: REPAIR 30 MIN, UNLOCK ANY PHONE, WE FIX WATER DAMAGE. A man sat behind the counter, head down, soldering something under a magnifying lamp. Connor walked past it the way he walked past everything in KL that didn't photograph well: without seeing it.

Back at the hostel, Connor climbed the narrow staircase to Dorm 3, the third step squeaking under his flip-flop, and dropped onto Bed 7. The ceiling fan rotated above him with the weary commitment of something that had given up on making a difference but hadn't technically stopped trying.

He opened his banking app.

The number sat there on the screen, small and plain and devastating. RM 847.23. He stared at it the way a man stares at a medical result that confirms his suspicions. Then he closed the app. Then he opened it again, as if the number might have changed in the interim -- a digital miracle, a banking glitch in his favour, a misplaced decimal that would reveal he actually had RM 8,472.30 and everything was fine.

RM 847.23.

His parents' next deposit was ten days away. Two thousand Australian dollars, which converted to roughly RM 5,800 at current rates. That money would land in his account on the twenty-first and he would feel the hot relief of reprieve, the way a drowning man feels when the wave recedes and leaves him gasping on the sand. But the twenty-first was ten days away. And RM 847 divided by ten days was RM 84.70 per day.

Connor did the maths, which was not a thing Connor typically did, which was itself a measure of how serious this had become. RM 84.70 a day. His hostel bed was RM 35. That left RM 49.70 for food, transport, and everything else.

RM 49.70 per day was survivable if he ate exclusively at hawker stalls. Nasi lemak from the aunty on Jalan Tun H.S. Lee, RM 5. Roti canai from the mamak stall on the corner, RM 2.50. Rice and a curry from any of the twenty places within stumbling distance of The Lantern, RM 8. He could eat three meals a day for under RM 20 if he abandoned every pretence of the lifestyle he photographed for Instagram.

No more RM 14 flat whites at Grind Culture. No more RM 18 avocado toast. No more RM 30 cocktails at the rooftop bar on Changkat where Felix had taken them two nights ago. No going out. The thought arrived with the weight of a prison sentence -- sitting in the hostel every evening while everyone else disappeared into the neon maze of the city and came back at 2 AM with stories and hangovers and the flushed contentment of people who could afford to be young.

Connor rolled over on the thin mattress and considered his options. There were four. There were always four.

Option A: Ask his parents for more money. His thumb hovered over his mother's contact. He could hear the conversation already. "Of course, darling, I'll talk to your father." And she would. And David Briggs would transfer the money, because David Briggs loved his son in the helpless, exasperated way of a man who understood that cutting the cord would require a conversation neither of them was ready for. But Megan would find out. Megan always found out. His sister had a forensic accountant's attention to the family finances and a prosecutor's enthusiasm for cross-examination. "He's twenty-seven, Mum. I was supporting myself at twenty-three. He's taking the piss." Connor could hear Megan's voice as clearly as if she were in the dorm. He put his phone down.

Option B: Get a real remote job. He'd considered this before, usually at 3 AM after three beers. He would learn web development. Or graphic design. Or real copywriting. He'd sign up for a course, build a portfolio, join the ranks of the genuinely location-independent.

The problem was sequential. To get a remote job, he needed a portfolio. To build a portfolio, he needed skills. To acquire skills, he needed discipline. And discipline was the one resource Connor had never possessed, not in twenty-seven years of life.

Option C: Go home.

The thought entered his mind the way a kidney stone enters the urinary tract -- unwelcome, excruciating, and impossible to ignore once it had arrived. Go home. Back to Melbourne. Back to Hawthorn. Back to his old bedroom with the posters of bands he didn't listen to anymore, back to his father's careful questions about "next steps," back to the brunch circuit with his parents' friends asking "So what are you up to now, Connor?" with the gentle concern of people addressing a terminal patient. Back to watching Megan and his mates continue their march through the milestones of adult life -- promotions, mortgages, engagements, babies -- while he stood on the platform wondering which train he was supposed to catch.

Going home meant admitting that the last four years had been an extended holiday funded by his parents. Going home meant admitting that "digital nomad" was a costume, not an identity.

The thought was physically revolting, like swallowing broken glass. He felt his chest tighten and his jaw clench, and he knew, with the certainty of a man who has confused cowardice for freedom, that he would rather starve in Southeast Asia than prosper in Melbourne.

Which left Option D.

Felix's offer. RM 200 for twenty minutes. Logistics. He'd done it twice already -- the envelope, the package to Brickfields -- and both times had been smooth, easy, weightless. If he did it once a day, that was RM 6,000 a month. More than his parents gave him. Enough to stay. Enough to live, properly, the way he pretended to on Instagram. Enough to buy Priya dinner at that Japanese place she'd mentioned.

He caught himself calculating. The numbers tumbled through his mind with the frictionless ease of a slot machine. RM 200 a day, seven days a week, RM 1,400 a week, enough for a private room, enough for flights to the next country, enough for --

He put his phone face-down on the mattress. The fan turned above him. Someone in the next dorm was playing lo-fi beats from a tinny speaker, the universal soundtrack of people pretending to be relaxed.

*She'll be right*, Connor thought. Then, less certainly: *She'll be right.*

He ordered another coffee at Grind Culture. RM 14. Because the cafe had aircon and the alternative was the hostel's common room, where the ceiling fan stirred the humidity into a warm soup. The barista made a better leaf pattern this time. Connor didn't photograph it. Progress, or exhaustion. Hard to tell.

---

Priya was already at the Pasar Seni LRT station when Connor arrived, forty minutes late, wearing the same board shorts from yesterday and a singlet that said GOOD VIBES ONLY in a font that suggested the vibes were, in fact, compulsory.

"You're late," she said, pushing her round glasses up her nose in the way that Connor found annoyingly endearing.

"I'm on island time."

"We're not on an island."

"It's a state of mind, Priya."

She looked at him with the expression she reserved for his more philosophical contributions -- part amusement, part despair, the face of a woman who was attracted to a man she couldn't fully respect and was negotiating the distance between the two.

"Come on," she said. "It's this way."

The train to Batu Caves took thirty minutes. Connor had never heard of the place until Priya mentioned it that morning in the hostel kitchen, while he was failing to operate the rice cooker and she was reading her battered Lonely Planet.

"Hindu temple complex in a limestone cave. Two hundred and seventy-two steps. Monkeys. A massive golden statue."

"Is there wifi?"

"Connor."

"Joking. Mostly. Yeah, sounds sick. Let's do it."

He'd agreed partly because she'd asked, and partly because he had nothing else to do that didn't cost money, and partly because there was a quality to Priya's enthusiasm that made resistance feel churlish.

The train deposited them at a station that opened directly onto the base of the caves, and Connor's first thought was that his phone camera was not going to be enough for this.

The limestone cliff rose up from the earth like the jawbone of something impossibly ancient, grey-white and sheer, jungle-draped at its crown. At its base, a golden statue stood guard -- Lord Murugan, Priya told him, the Hindu god of war, forty-two metres tall, its surface blazing in the afternoon sun so intensely that Connor had to squint.

"Forty-two metres," Priya said, tilting her head back. "Tallest Murugan statue in the world. Three hundred litres of gold paint."

"Where do you even buy three hundred litres of gold paint?"

She laughed. She had a good laugh -- unstudied, a little too loud, the laugh of someone who hadn't yet learned to perform her own amusement. He found himself smiling back in a way that felt genuine and slightly dangerous.

The 272 steps were painted in the colours of a rainbow -- red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, repeating in bands up the face of the cliff, as though someone had dropped a paintbox from the top and let gravity do the work. Tourists and pilgrims streamed up and down in a mixed current of devotion and breathlessness, pausing to photograph each other, to pray, to gasp, to buy water from the vendors stationed at strategic intervals like aid stations on a marathon course.

The monkeys were everywhere. Long-tailed macaques with the confidence of old-money aristocrats and the morals of pickpockets, perched on railings and tourists' shoulders, watching the procession with amber eyes that missed nothing. Connor saw one steal a water bottle from an elderly woman's bag with surgical precision. Another sat on the rainbow steps eating a mango, regarding the humans below with the tolerant contempt of a creature that had never needed to invent the concept of a job.

"Don't show them your phone," Priya warned, grabbing his wrist as he raised it for a photo. "They'll take it."

"What, the monkeys?"

"They grab shiny things. There are signs everywhere, Connor."

There were signs everywhere. Connor hadn't read them.

They climbed. The heat was a living thing on the exposed staircase -- direct equatorial sun on painted concrete, no shade until the cave mouth above. Connor's flip-flops slapped on the steps. Priya, in sensible trainers, kept a steady pace, her braid swinging against her back like a metronome. He watched her climb and thought about things he hadn't thought about in a while -- not sex, which he thought about constantly, but something quieter. Something that didn't have a hashtag.

The cave mouth swallowed them like a throat.

Inside, the temperature dropped -- the limestone breathing its stored chill into the trapped air. The cavern opened up and Connor stopped walking because his brain needed a moment to accommodate the scale. The cave chamber was the size of a cathedral, the ceiling a hundred feet overhead, stalactites hanging like the pipes of an organ, light pouring in through gaps in the rock in dusty golden shafts that illuminated a Hindu shrine -- draped in garlands of marigolds and jasmine, attended by priests in white, surrounded by incense smoke and the quiet murmur of prayer.

"Bloody hell," Connor said.

Priya didn't correct his language. She was looking up, her glasses reflecting the shafts of light, and her face had the openness of someone standing in the presence of something they took seriously.

They sat on a low wall at the edge of the chamber. Below them, the stairs cascaded down to the green suburban sprawl of Selangor. Above them, the cave ceiling dripped with mineral deposits that had taken a hundred million years to form. The air smelled of wet stone and incense and the faint green rot of jungle. A priest chanted somewhere nearby, the words rising and falling in a cadence that felt older than the rock itself.

Connor's phone was in his pocket. He didn't take it out. He wasn't sure why. The light was good. The content was exceptional. But something about the cave -- the scale, the silence, the weight of all that time frozen in limestone -- made performing his own experience feel small.

"It's nice here," he said, and then winced at the inadequacy of the word.

"It's been a sacred site for thousands of years," Priya said. "People have been climbing those steps to pray for longer than most countries have existed."

"And now there's a bloke in board shorts sitting in the middle of it wondering if his flat white was tax-deductible."

She looked at him. "Is that what you're wondering?"

"No." He picked at the leather bracelet on his wrist. The full moon party bracelet. He'd had it so long it was part of his body now, a second skin he'd grown in Thailand and never shed. "I don't know what I'm wondering. That's sort of the problem."

Priya waited. She was good at waiting. It was a quality that Connor found unnerving -- the patience of someone who listened not to respond but to understand. Most people Connor talked to were just waiting for their turn to speak. Priya waited like a doctor waits for a patient to describe the pain.

"Everyone back home has a job," he said. "A mortgage. A plan. Megan -- my sister -- she's an accountant. My mates are buying houses. Dave got engaged last month. Simmo's having a kid. And I'm..." He gestured vaguely at the cave, at the stairs, at the general concept of Southeast Asia. "I'm here. I'm twenty-seven and I'm here."

"What's wrong with here?"

"Nothing. Everything. I don't know." He laughed, but there was nothing behind it. A laugh without fuel. "Here is amazing. Here is a cave with a temple in it and monkeys that steal your phone. Here is incredible. But here isn't a plan, is it? Here isn't something you put on a CV. Here isn't..." He trailed off. The incense drifted past them. A child ran by, chasing a macaque, both of them shrieking. "Here isn't real life. That's what my dad says, anyway. 'When are you going to start your real life, Con?' Like this is the rehearsal."

"Maybe it is," Priya said. Not unkindly.

"Yeah. Maybe." He stared at his hands. The compass tattoo on his inner forearm -- the one he'd got in Bali, the one that was supposed to mean *I go where the wind takes me* but actually meant *I was drunk in Kuta and the tattoo parlor was open* -- stared back at him, permanently pointing nowhere in particular. "The thing is, right, I left uni after a year. Business degree at Monash. Hated it. Not because it was hard -- I don't know if it was hard, I never actually tried. I just hated what it represented. The conveyor belt. Go to school, go to uni, get a graduate job, buy a house, retire, die. I thought, sod this, I'm going to live. And I did. For four years I've lived more than anyone I know."

"Have you, though?"

The question landed softly but precisely, like a surgeon's scalpel touching the nerve. Connor looked at her.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, living more -- what does that look like? Not the Instagram version. The actual version. Are you learning things? Growing? Or are you just... in a different place, doing the same nothing?"

He should have been offended. A week ago he would have been. He would have hit her with the standard defence -- *at least I'm not a slave to the system, at least I'm experiencing the world, at least I'm not going to look back at forty and wish I'd taken the risk.* But something about the cave, or the incense, or the fact that he'd spent the morning photographing coffee he couldn't afford while calculating how many days he had until he was broke, had worn a hole in his armour, and Priya's question went right through it.

"I don't know," he said. And for once, he meant it.

They sat in the cave for a long time after that. The light shifted as the sun moved, the shafts turning from gold to amber to a deep honeyed orange that made the chamber look like the inside of a lantern. Priya told him about her degree -- the impossibility of fourth-year medicine, the patients she'd already lost on placement. She told him about her parents in Ealing -- her father the cardiologist at St Thomas' who was never home before nine, her mother who ran a GP practice in Wembley and had channelled her own medical ambition into Priya with a ferocity that was sometimes love and sometimes something harder.

"So you're running from something too," Connor said.

"I suppose. But I'm running toward something as well. The two aren't mutually exclusive."

He wanted to kiss her. The desire arrived fully formed, not as lust but as something closer to gratitude -- the need to close the gap between his loneliness and her attention. He leaned slightly. She was close enough that he could see the tiny scar on her upper lip. Her eyes, behind the round glasses, were dark and serious and very still.

He didn't kiss her. The moment held, balanced on its point like a coin on edge, and then a macaque screamed somewhere above them and a child laughed and the moment fell on its side and was just a moment, one of many, unremarkable except for the fact that Connor would remember it for the rest of his life, which would not be as long as either of them expected.

"We should head back," Priya said. "There's a thunderstorm coming."

She was right. By the time they descended the 272 rainbow steps, the sky had darkened to that particular equatorial purple that meant the clouds had been holding their breath all day and were about to exhale. The first drops fell as they reached the station, fat and warm. Then the sky opened and the world became water.

They stood under the station awning and watched the rain -- a wall of water descending vertically, turning the road into a river, the noise a sustained roar like standing inside a drum. The temperature dropped ten degrees in as many seconds, and the relief was physical, the city exhaling after a day of holding itself in.

"I like KL," Connor said, watching the rain.

"I know," Priya said. "That's what makes it dangerous for you."

He looked at her. She was looking at the rain.

---

Felix was on the rooftop when Connor got back to The Lantern that evening, sitting in one of the plastic chairs with a Tiger beer sweating in his hand, looking at the Petronas Towers as they did their nightly transformation from architectural achievement to jewellery. He looked, as always, like a man who never sweated, even in a city that was basically a sauna with traffic lights.

"Connor." He raised his beer. "Sit down."

Connor sat. Felix produced a second Tiger from somewhere -- he always had beer, the way other people always had anxiety -- and handed it over. Connor drank and felt the first sip spread through his chest like an argument he was losing.

"Good day?" Felix asked.

"Yeah. Went to Batu Caves with Priya."

"Ah, the caves. Beautiful place. I went when I first arrived in KL. Three years ago now." He sipped his beer. "You and Priya, you're spending a lot of time together."

"She's cool."

"She is cool. Smart, too. That's rare in hostels." Felix looked at him sideways, the scar on his eyebrow catching the last of the light. "She'll leave though. They always do, the smart ones. They have somewhere to go back to."

The sentence landed in the silence between them like a stone in still water. Connor felt the ripples but didn't acknowledge them. He drank his beer instead.

"How's the work going?" Felix asked. The question was casual. Everything Felix did was casual. It was his native register, the key in which he played every note.

"Yeah, good. Smashing it."

"The social media thing."

"Content strategy. Yeah."

"Pays well?"

Connor hesitated. The hesitation was microscopic -- a quarter-second pause before the breezy facade reassembled itself -- but Felix caught it. He'd been watching Connor for days, watching the way his eyes flickered to his phone screen and away, watching the quiet arithmetic of a man dividing dwindling resources against remaining time. Felix had seen this before. This was the shape of the trap -- not a trap he set, exactly, but a trap that already existed, a trap made of currency exchange rates and the cost of staying abroad. All Felix had to do was wait.

"It pays," Connor said. "Enough to keep me going."

"Going where?"

Connor laughed. "Here. There. Wherever." He drank. The beer was almost gone. The city spread out below them, a carpet of light, and above them the stars were appearing one by one through the gaps in the clouds, and the air smelled of rain and exhaust and the jasmine plant that someone had left in a pot by the rooftop railing.

"Can I be honest with you?" Felix said.

"Always, mate."

"The system is designed to make you go home." The speech was polished, rehearsed -- a script he'd delivered in hostels across Asia to broke, proud, afraid young travellers who looked exactly like Connor. "Rent. Bills. Visa restrictions. It's all engineered to force you back into the machine. But there are ways around it. If you know the right people."

He let the silence sit. A gecko chirped somewhere on the wall behind them, its small voice absurdly loud in the quiet.

"That offer's still open, mate," Felix said. "Nothing illegal. Just... logistics. Delivering documents, picking up packages. Import-export business. RM 200 per run, sometimes more."

The way he said it. That was the thing. The way he said *nothing illegal* with the relaxed authority of a man stating a fact. The way he said *RM 200* like it was a casual figure, not the difference between staying and going home, between freedom and defeat.

Connor thought about the maths. RM 200 a day. No more counting. No more photographing coffee he couldn't afford. RM 200 a day was staying. RM 200 a day was not going home.

"I'll think about it," Connor said.

"Of course." Felix leaned back. "No pressure. Ever. I just hate seeing good people go home because the system's rigged against them."

He finished his beer, stood, clapped Connor on the shoulder with the easy affection of a man who had just placed a bet and knew, with quiet certainty, that the house always wins.

"Goodnight, Connor. Think about it."

He disappeared down the staircase. Connor sat alone on the rooftop. The Petronas Towers watched him back.

---

The common room was nearly empty when Connor came downstairs. The red lanterns cast their permanent warm glow across the mismatched furniture and the bookshelf of abandoned novels.

Priya was in the corner, curled into an armchair, reading her Lonely Planet by the amber light of the nearest lantern. A pen in her hand, marking the margins. Planning. Always planning. She looked up when Connor entered and smiled, and he thought about the cave, the light through the gap in the rock, the conversation he couldn't quite believe had come out of his mouth.

He sat on the sofa across from her. Checked his phone. His Instagram post from that morning -- the flat white, the twelve hashtags, the lie about the digital nomad life -- had accumulated forty-one likes and two comments. One was from his mum: "Looks lovely darling! Stay safe xx." The other was from Pacific Soul's official account: a surfboard emoji, algorithmically deployed.

His phone buzzed.

A text from Felix: *No pressure. But if you're interested, I have something tomorrow. Easy. Quick. Think about it.*

Connor looked at the message. He looked at Priya, absorbed in her guidebook, lips moving slightly as she formed Malay words she was teaching herself. Because Priya learned the languages and read the signs and researched the laws. Because Priya did not assume that the world would rearrange itself around her convenience.

He thought about the afternoon. The vulnerability that had leaked out of him in the cave like blood from a wound he hadn't known he had. The way she'd looked at him when he said *I don't know* -- not with pity, not with judgment, but with something that felt like being seen for the first time in four years.

He thought about his bank balance. RM 847.23. Minus the two coffees today. Minus the train fare. Minus whatever tomorrow would cost. The number dropping like a countdown.

He texted Felix back: *Tell me more.*

He put his phone face-down on the armrest.

Priya looked up from her guidebook. "Everything okay?"

"Yeah," Connor said. He smiled -- the Instagram smile, confident, easy, bulletproof. The one he'd perfected over four years of pretending everything was fine.

"Everything's sweet."

Priya looked at him a moment longer. Then she nodded and returned to her book, and the pen resumed its quiet marking, and the red lanterns glowed, and somewhere outside a motorbike engine coughed to life and faded into the distance, and Connor sat in the warm amber light of The Lantern Hostel with his phone face-down and his future face-up and the word *logistics* turning over and over in his mind like a coin he couldn't stop flipping.

The smile didn't reach his eyes. But nobody was looking at his eyes. Nobody ever was.
# Chapter 6: The Envelope

Felix found him in the common room at half nine in the morning, which was early for Felix and obscene for Connor. The German was showered, shaved, and wearing a fresh linen shirt the colour of cream, looking less like a man who lived in a backpacker hostel and more like a man who had stepped out of a cologne advertisement to temporarily grace one with his presence. He was carrying two coffees from somewhere outside -- not the instant Nescafe that the hostel kitchen offered in a jar with a rusted lid, but real coffee, in paper cups with sleeves and lids and a logo that looked expensive. Felix always had good coffee. Felix always had good everything.

Connor was on the corduroy sofa, horizontal, one arm draped over his eyes. He was wearing the board shorts he'd slept in and a singlet with a faded Corona logo that had been through enough wash cycles to achieve a transparency that bordered on the conceptual. His phone was on his chest, playing a podcast about cryptocurrency investing he wasn't listening to.

"Morning," Felix said, and placed one of the coffees on the jigsaw table. The jigsaw had not progressed since Connor's arrival. The Petronas Towers remained headless.

Connor peeled his arm from his face and squinted up. "What time is it?"

"Nine-thirty."

"Jesus." He sat up, rubbed his face, and reached for the coffee. Flat white. Perfect. The caffeine began its repair work on the damage done by last night's beers -- four Tigers on the rooftop with Jake, followed by two rum-and-Cokes at a karaoke bar on Changkat where a group of Korean tourists had performed a genuinely moving rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody."

"You're a legend," Connor said, meaning the coffee, meaning Felix, meaning the simple fact that someone in this city knew what he wanted before he did.

Felix sat in the armchair opposite, arranging himself with his usual studied ease. "How's the bank account?"

Connor's jaw worked. Seven hundred and twelve ringgit. Roughly two hundred and thirty Australian dollars. His parents' monthly deposit wasn't due for another eight days. He could survive on hostel noodles and free toast, but surviving wasn't the point. You couldn't curate the digital nomad life on seven hundred ringgit.

"It's fine," Connor said, because he said this about everything.

"I have something for you."

Felix reached into his canvas messenger bag and produced a Manila envelope. Standard size. Sealed. The kind of envelope you'd see in any office -- the universal container of boring adult things. He placed it on the jigsaw table.

"What's that?"

"A favour. A small one. Twenty minutes, maybe."

Connor picked it up. Light -- the weight of a few sheets of paper. He turned it over. No markings. The seal was firm, gummed flap and brass clasp.

"I do some work for an import-export company," Felix said. "Photography, mostly -- product shots for their catalogue. Boring stuff, but it pays. They need these documents delivered to one of their associates. Physical copies. Their courier service in KL is --" he grinned -- "*scheisse*. Unreliable. These are contracts, invoices, sensitive business documents. They need a human being to walk them from A to B."

"Why can't you do it?" Connor asked, and later -- much later -- he would recognise this as the only sensible question he'd asked in the entire conversation, and how easily Felix had navigated around it.

"I have a meeting. A gallery in Bangsar wants to exhibit some of my Malaysia series. The meeting is at eleven and I can't be in Bukit Bintang and Bangsar at the same time."

It made sense. That was the thing about Felix's explanations -- they always made sense. Not the aggressive sense of a lie trying too hard, but the easy sense of a truth that had nothing to prove.

"Two hundred ringgit," Felix said. "For twenty minutes of walking."

Connor did the math. Not the real math -- not *why would anyone pay two hundred ringgit for a twenty-minute walk*, or *what kind of business documents can't be emailed*. He did the other math. Two hundred ringgit was almost a third of his remaining funds, materialised from thin air. Four nights at the hostel. Ten plates of Mama Siti's nasi lemak. The difference between anxiety and comfort.

"Where am I going?"

"A cafe in Bukit Bintang. Brickhouse -- exposed brick, minimalist, charges fifteen ringgit for a flat white." He smiled. "You'll meet a man sitting alone. Blue polo shirt, reading a newspaper. Hand him the envelope. He won't say much. I'll send the money via GrabPay as soon as you confirm."

"That's it?"

"That's it."

Connor turned the envelope over. His thumb found the seal. He could open it. The thought arrived and departed in the same instant, the way a fish surfaces and vanishes -- visible for a fraction of a second, gone before the brain can form the word *fish*. He could open the envelope and make an informed decision about carrying it across the city for a man he'd known for six days, in a country where the drug laws were printed in red on signs the size of doors.

Connor did not open the envelope.

"One thing," Felix said, his voice shifting by a degree -- not colder, just more precise. "Don't open it. Sensitive business documents -- invoices, client details. Confidentiality is a big deal. If the seal is broken, they won't accept delivery and neither of us gets paid."

"Easy as," Connor said.

He put the envelope in the back pocket of his board shorts. Felix finished his coffee, stood, and adjusted his messenger bag.

"Text me when it's done." At the archway, he paused. "And Connor? Thanks, mate."

He said *mate* with the German accent, the *a* wider and flatter than an Australian would make it, and this small linguistic mimicry made the whole thing feel like a favour between friends.

Felix's footsteps climbed the narrow staircase -- the third step from the top squeaked -- and his door opened and closed with a soft click.

Connor sat in the common room with the envelope in his pocket and the morning light falling through the air well onto the mosaic tiles. From the kitchen, the clatter of Mama Siti's pans. The smell of coconut rice and sambal. He finished his coffee, checked his phone -- 10:07 -- and walked out into the heat.

---

The walk from Chinatown to Bukit Bintang was a transit through layers of Kuala Lumpur, each one thinner and more polished than the last, as if the city were shedding its history block by block and emerging into something chrome and air-conditioned and new.

Connor stepped out of the hostel's narrow door -- the phone repair shop on his left humming its fluorescent hum, the Chinese medicine store on his right dark and aromatic -- and into the late-morning chaos of Petaling Street. The market was in full throat: vendors unfolding trestle tables, hanging counterfeit handbags from wire frames, stacking bootleg sneakers in their boxes. A man was grilling satay over a portable charcoal grill, the smoke rising in a column that caught the light and turned it amber. Cantonese clattered above the traffic noise. A motorbike threaded through the pedestrian flow with the casual disregard for physics that Malaysian motorbikes treated as a religious principle.

He filmed, of course. Phone up, one-handed grip, low confessional voice.

"Morning walk through KL. Chinatown first thing -- the energy here is unreal. No itinerary, just stepping out the door and letting the city happen to you."

He turned the camera on himself. Grin. The market a blur behind him.

"Day six in Malaysia. Six days of no plan and everything's working out."

Past the Guan Di Temple, its red facade glowing like an ember, joss stick smoke curling from the open door. Past the dried goods shops and the old men playing Chinese chess on an upturned crate. Jalan Sultan widened. Shophouses gave way to commercial buildings. A 7-Eleven. A bank. Traffic thickened in a three-way negotiation that Connor couldn't parse but which never resulted in collision.

The humidity was building toward its daily crescendo. Connor's singlet darkened between his shoulder blades. His Havaianas slapped against the pavement. The envelope sat in his back pocket. He didn't think about it. He thought about the money, about extending his stay, about buying Priya dinner at that place Jake had mentioned on Jalan Alor.

He passed a police officer.

The officer was standing on the corner of Jalan Sultan and Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, a young Malay man in the light blue uniform of the Polis Diraja Malaysia, his cap pulled low against the sun, a walkie-talkie crackling on his hip. He was watching the traffic with the practised boredom of a man on a routine post. Connor walked past him -- two meters from a uniformed officer, a sealed envelope of unverified contents in his back pocket, given to him by a man he'd known for six days, to be delivered to a stranger across the city. He felt nothing. No spike of adrenaline, no flutter of conscience, no whisper of *maybe you should think about what you're doing*. He was carrying business documents. Boring stuff. A mate's favour.

He was invisible in the way that privilege makes you invisible -- not hidden, but beneath notice, unworthy of suspicion, because people who looked like Connor didn't do things that warranted suspicion. That was for other people. Connor knew this without knowing it, the way a fish knows water -- it was the medium he moved through, and he had never once been asked to name it.

Jalan Sultan became Jalan Bukit Bintang by degrees. Shophouses vanished. Glass-fronted malls appeared -- Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, the same brands in every city. The sidewalks widened. He stopped filming. Modernity didn't play well on Instagram. Nobody double-tapped a Zara storefront.

He followed Felix's directions: past the intersection, left at the Starbucks, down a side street of gentrified shophouses -- a barber shop with exposed bulbs, a boutique selling "curated" handicrafts, a yoga studio. And there: Brickhouse Cafe.

It was exactly the kind of place Felix had described. Exposed brick walls -- the original shophouse brickwork, cleaned and sealed and turned from functional material into aesthetic statement. Blonde wood tables, black metal chairs, the kind of Scandinavian-Japanese hybrid aesthetic Connor had seen in a hundred cafes across Southeast Asia. An enormous Italian coffee machine gleamed like a surgical instrument behind the counter. The menu was written in chalk: *Flat White RM15. Pour Over RM18. Matcha Latte RM16.* A single monstera plant in a ceramic pot guarded the entrance.

Air conditioning hit him like a wall of cold, the sudden shift from tropical humidity to controlled coolness that was, in its way, as much a feature of KL as the heat itself.

The cafe was half-full. A young woman with a laptop and the focused expression of someone meeting a deadline. Two men in business shirts having a meeting over espressos. A mother with a toddler in a highchair, the toddler systematically disassembling a croissant. And at the back, alone, reading a newspaper, wearing a blue polo shirt: the man.

Malaysian, maybe Chinese-Malaysian. Middle-aged. Nondescript. The kind of face you'd forget before you'd finished looking at it. His newspaper was the *New Straits Times*, folded to the business section. He read with the absorption of a man who had been told to look like he was reading.

Connor approached. "Hey, mate. I've got something from Felix."

The man looked up. His eyes met Connor's for a fraction of a second, then swept the cafe -- door, windows, other customers. Then his eyes dropped to Connor's chest -- specifically the area where a wire might be taped -- then to the envelope Connor was pulling from his pocket.

He did not speak. He did not smile. He reached out and took the envelope with a motion closer to extraction than acceptance, his fingers closing around it in a single fluid movement.

The envelope disappeared below the table. The soft tear of the clasp opening. Rustle of paper. Silence. The man's eyes were lowered, his face a mask of professional blankness, his hands invisible beneath the tabletop.

"So... we're good?" Connor said.

The man nodded once. A single, minimal dip of the chin. There was nothing in his eyes. Not hostility, not warmth. The eyes of a man who had trained himself to be a surface with nothing behind it.

Connor got the social cue -- the conversation was over -- without getting the actual hint: normal business associates make eye contact. They say hello. They do not scan rooms for surveillance before accepting envelopes, and they do not open them under tables. These were not the behaviours of a man receiving invoices.

Connor noticed none of this. He noticed that the man was rude, and that the cafe had good natural light.

"Right. Cool."

He walked out. Three steps along the pavement. His phone buzzed. GrabPay: *You have received RM200.00 from F. Decker.*

The hit was immediate and chemical, a flush of warmth that started in his chest and radiated outward to his extremities. It was not unlike the feeling of the first beer of the day, or the feeling of a post getting more likes than expected, or the feeling of a pretty girl laughing at something he'd said. It was the feeling of the world confirming that you were doing it right, that your instincts were correct, that the approach of just going with it and saying yes and not overthinking things was, in fact, the superior way to live. Two hundred ringgit for twenty minutes of walking. The hourly rate was -- Connor calculated with the only mathematics he respected -- approximately six hundred ringgit per hour, which was more than most people in this city earned in a day, and he'd earned it by putting one foot in front of the other.

He grinned. He grinned at the street, at the shopping malls, at the taxis lined up outside Lot 10, at a pair of girls in hijabs who walked past and did not grin back.

He texted Felix: *Done. Smooth as. Cheers legend.*

Felix's reply came within thirty seconds: *Perfect. Told you - easy money. Enjoy your day.*

---

He stopped at a street stall two blocks from the hostel and ordered a teh tarik. The stall was one of his discoveries -- a narrow counter under a zinc awning, run by an Indian-Malaysian man in his sixties who made pulled tea with the theatrical flair of a bartender and the precision of a chemist. The man held two metal cups at arm's length -- one high, one low -- and poured the milky tea between them in a long, frothy arc, the liquid streaming down in a golden rope that never broke, never splashed. It was a performance. It was a skill refined over decades. It was exactly the kind of thing Connor would have filmed if he hadn't already filmed it twice.

The teh tarik was sweet and milky and perfect. Connor drank it standing at the counter, two hundred ringgit richer, savouring not just the money but the sense of capability -- that he, Connor Briggs, had a skill the world would pay for. Granted, the skill was walking, but still. Felix had needed someone reliable. Felix had chosen him. There was something flattering in that, something that confirmed what Connor had always believed about himself: that he was a person who attracted opportunity because he was open to it in a way that planners and worriers simply weren't.

He left a five-ringgit note on the counter -- a generous tip, the generosity of the newly flush -- and walked back to the hostel.

The common room was occupied. Jake was sprawled on the corduroy sofa like a golden retriever that had been asked to sit and had interpreted the instruction liberally. He was wearing a backwards cap, a Quiksilver T-shirt, eating a banana, and watching surfing wipeouts on his phone without headphones.

"Dude! Where you been?"

Connor dropped into the armchair. "Side hustle," he said, and grinned. He was already constructing the narrative -- converting the morning into anecdote, shaping experience into content, which was what he did with everything. "You know that import-export company Felix does photography for? They needed someone to run some documents across town. Business papers, contracts, that kind of thing. Twenty minutes of walking. Two hundred ringgit."

Jake's eyebrows rose above the frame of his sunglasses, which were perched on his forehead despite being indoors. "Dude. Two hundred ringgit for *walking*? That's sick."

"For walking."

"That's like fifty bucks for doing nothing."

"Right?" Connor leaned back. The armchair smelled of dust and Tiger Balm and the collective exhaustion of a thousand backpackers. "Felix reckons there might be more. Regular thing."

"You're, like, living the dream, man. Side hustle in KL. That's content right there. You should post about it."

Connor considered this. An Instagram story: *Making money while making memories. The digital nomad life isn't just laptops and lattes. #sidehustle #KLlife #makingitwork.* He could see the likes accumulating, the comments from people back home who worked nine-to-five and scrolled through his feed thinking *how does he afford this?* Now he'd have an answer.

Neither of them heard the footsteps. Neither noticed Priya until she was already there, standing in the archway, her battered Lonely Planet under one arm, her round glasses pushed up her nose, her hair in its single long braid. She had heard the last two minutes.

"What kind of company?" she asked.

Connor straightened. He liked Priya. More than liked. She was smart and sharp and looked at him like she could see something in him that he couldn't see himself.

"Import-export. Photography equipment, I think. Felix's thing."

Her expression changed in a way Connor didn't have the resolution to detect -- a tightening at the corners of her mouth, the face of a fourth-year medical student registering a symptom. She held it for half a second.

"Hm. Right." She pushed her glasses up. "What were you delivering?"

"An envelope. Business documents. Invoices, contracts, boring stuff."

"Did you look at them?"

"Nah, they're sealed. Confidential."

Priya looked at Connor for a long moment. Then at Jake, who wasn't looking at either of them. Then at the floor.

"Be careful," she said.

"Of what?" Connor laughed -- his reflex against seriousness. "It's an envelope, Priya. Business papers. Felix is a mate."

"You've known him for six days."

"And they've been a great six days." The grin was a wall, and behind it, nothing. "Relax. It's all good."

Priya said "Okay" in a voice that communicated the opposite, and walked out the front door into Petaling Street.

Connor watched her go. He felt something -- not guilt, not concern, but a vague irritation, the itchy displeasure that arrived whenever someone introduced friction into the smooth narrative of his life. Priya was doing the thing that careful people did: worrying about things that didn't need worrying about. She was a planner. A Googler. A reader of guidebooks and fine print. He liked her, genuinely, but sometimes being around her was like wearing a seatbelt in a parked car. Necessary, she'd argue. Unnecessary, he'd counter. And he was right. He was always right about these things.

"She's cool," Jake said, not looking up. "Kind of intense though."

"She's great," Connor said, and went upstairs.

---

Dorm 3 was empty except for the ceiling fan, which turned with patient indifference, and the smell of old wood and damp cotton. The afternoon light came through the air well in a shaft of grey-white -- clouds gathering for the daily storm.

Connor climbed into Bed 7. The mattress squeaked. He lay on his back, scrolled Instagram, liked photos, the mechanical rhythm soothing in its mindlessness. He was buzzing with the teh tarik and the two hundred ringgit and the residual irritation from Priya's concern.

A noise in the doorway.

Aziz was standing at the entrance to Dorm 3, filling the frame the way a boulder fills a streambed -- wide shoulders touching both sides of the doorway, the air rerouting around him. He was holding a toolbox and a replacement motor for the ceiling fan, and he was looking at Connor.

In six days, Connor had heard Aziz say exactly four words: "Fan. Tomorrow. Morning." and, on a separate occasion, "No." He was in his fifties, broad-shouldered, with the kind of forearms that suggested a lifetime of physical work and the kind of eyes that suggested a lifetime of things he'd rather not have seen. He chain-smoked Gudang Garam kretek cigarettes in the alley. He fixed things. He checked IDs. He was, in Connor's taxonomy, a background character.

But Aziz was looking at him now with an expression that was something closer to grief -- the look of a person watching a thing happen that they have seen happen before and will see happen again and cannot stop.

Aziz set down his toolbox. He set down the motor. He stood in the doorway and opened his mouth.

The silence that followed was not empty. It was full of the words Aziz was not saying, words he had said once before in a different life and the saying of which had cost him his badge, his pension, his marriage, and very nearly his life. *I know what the envelope was. I know who Felix is. I have seen this play out before, with someone who slept in that exact bed, and she is in prison now.* The words were behind his teeth. He could feel them the way you feel a sneeze building.

Aziz's jaw worked. The muscles in his face shifted, rearranged, settled.

He had been a police officer once. Twenty-two years with the Polis Diraja Malaysia, twelve as a narcotics detective. He had been good at it. He had, on one occasion in 2014, followed the evidence to a place his superiors didn't want him to go and filed a report about connections between a trafficking ring and certain officers. The report had ended his career. Not violently -- just a transfer, then a redundancy, then a pension that evaporated in an administrative error never corrected. His wife left six months later. Aziz had taken the handyman job because Razak was his cousin and because the building needed things fixed and because speaking up was a luxury for people with nothing to lose, and he had discovered, too late, that he had everything to lose.

He had watched Lena. The Swedish girl. Bed 7. He had watched her carry envelopes, then packages, then a backpack. He had watched Felix build around her the same architecture closing now around Connor. He had said nothing, and Lena was in Kajang Prison, and Aziz fixed ceiling fans and smoked kretek cigarettes in the alley and said nothing.

He closed his mouth.

He picked up his toolbox. Picked up the motor. Stood in the doorway one more second, his eyes meeting Connor's -- a transmission of something not quite information, a frequency of human distress that required, on the receiver's part, a sensitivity Connor did not possess.

"You right, mate?" Connor said.

Aziz turned and walked down the corridor. His footsteps receded -- the third step from the top squeaked -- and then he was gone.

Connor shrugged. The physical gesture, shoulders up and down, a one-second dismissal. A weird bloke having a weird moment. Hostel people. You got all types.

He opened Instagram.

---

The storm came at 2:14 PM, as it always did, with a rumble of thunder that vibrated through the old building's bones and then the sudden, percussive fury of tropical rain on zinc roofs and tile courtyards and the open throat of the air well. The dorm darkened. The air cooled. Connor spent the afternoon in the common room -- the storm had driven the hostel's population inside, filling the space with the restless, stir-crazy energy of travellers trapped by weather. The French couple were there, and the guitar player who had located a fourth string. Jake was teaching a Japanese girl a card game he was inventing as he went. Mama Siti shuffled through the kitchen and produced a pot of curry that filled the ground floor with the smell of turmeric and coconut milk and lemongrass.

Connor ate the curry. He ate seconds. He told Mama Siti it was "insane, restaurant-quality," and she looked at him with the expression of a woman who had been cooking since before he was born and did not require his assessment. He posted a photo to his stories: *When the hostel cook is better than any restaurant in the city. #KLfood #hostellife.*

When Priya came back from the Islamic Arts Museum, she showed him photos on her phone -- geometric patterns, illuminated manuscripts, ceramic tiles in shades of blue. He listened. He asked questions. She was surprised. He was surprised by himself. For twenty minutes on the bench by the air well they talked about art and the weight of time, and Connor was, for those twenty minutes, a better version of himself -- curious, attentive, almost wise. It didn't last. It couldn't. But Priya saw it, and filed it in the part of her mind where she kept the evidence that Connor might be worth saving.

Night. The hostel quieted. The rooftop drinkers drank. The snorers snored. The ceiling fan turned.

He was in his bunk, Bed 7, Dorm 3. The room was dark except for the blue-white glow of phone screens -- the universal nightlight of the modern hostel, the scattered constellations of people lying in the dark, connected to everywhere except where they were. Someone above him watching a video, the volume barely audible -- a woman's voice, Korean, rhythmic and soothing. A gentle snore across the room. The air well letting in the city's deep-night sounds -- a motorbike, a cat, the long low moan of a cargo truck on Jalan Sultan.

Connor was scrolling. He'd posted the photo from his walk -- the KL skyline, slightly blurred in a way he'd decided was "intentional." Filter to deepen the shadows, add grain. The caption had taken twelve minutes:

*The city reveals itself to those who walk it. No map. No destination. Just motion and the faith that the next corner holds something worth seeing. #KL #kualalumpur #digitalnomad #streetphotography #noplan #livingmybestlife #malaysia*

Forty-seven likes. His mother: *Love this! Dad says hi xx.* A girl from Chiang Mai: *Omg KL is on my list!* A bot offering collab opportunities.

He rolled onto his side. The bunk creaked. His hand slid off the mattress and brushed the wooden frame -- dark, old wood, warm from the room's trapped heat. His fingers trailed along the surface, idle, sensing without seeking.

His fingertips found the grooves.

Letters. Carved small and shallow, someone pressing a point into the grain, letter by letter. The grooves were smooth with age. His fingers passed over them, reading the name in Braille, in the dark, without his eyes.

L. E. N. A.

If he turned on his phone flashlight and looked, he would see it. If he asked, someone might tell him about the Swedish girl who'd slept in this bed, who'd met a charming European man in the common room, who was now in Kajang Prison, four hundred and seven days into a wait for a trial that would almost certainly end with a judge pronouncing the words *gantung sampai mati* -- hanged until dead.

But Connor did not look. His hand was already back under his pillow, his eyes already closing, and the name was already forgotten -- not forgotten, because it had never been known. It was a texture. A roughness in wood. An imperfection he slept against every night and had never examined, because examining things was not what Connor did.

---

His phone screen lit up.

White light cutting through the dark. Connor's eyes opened. His thumb unlocked the screen before his brain had surfaced from sleep.

A text from Felix. 12:47 AM.

*See? Easy. Got another one tomorrow if you're keen. Same deal.*

Connor read the message. *See? Easy.* Yes. *Got another one tomorrow.* Another envelope. Another walk. Another two hundred ringgit. *If you're keen.* If. As if there were a version of Connor who would think *I'd like to know what I'm carrying and who I'm carrying it to and why a man I've known for six days is paying me to do something he could do himself*. As if there were a version of Connor who would lie in the dark and think, really think, about what it means when someone pays you not to ask questions.

His thumb hovered over the keyboard. The cursor blinked. The dorm was silent except for the breathing of seven people and the fan and the rain on the air well -- the particular, charged quiet of a moment that is, though the person living it does not know, a hinge.

Connor typed four letters.

*Keen.*

He sent it without thinking. Because why wouldn't he? It was just envelopes. It was just paper. Easy money in a city where money was the difference between the life he was living and the life he was afraid of. She'll be right. She'll always be right. Tomorrow another envelope, another walk, another two hundred ringgit, each one just as easy and just as harmless and just as light in his back pocket.

He put the phone face-down on the mattress. The screen went dark.

Connor closed his eyes. In two minutes he was asleep.

In the wooden frame of Bed 7, four letters held their shape in the dark, and the name they spelled belonged to a woman who had typed the same word -- *keen* -- on the same bed, to the same man, thirteen months ago, and who was now in a cell three hours south of this city, counting the days until a judge decided whether she would live or die.

The ceiling fan turned.

The rain fell.

The city did not care.
# Chapter 7: The Law You Don't Know

The toaster was trying to kill him.

Not in the Malaysian way -- not with the slow, systemic patience of a country whose legal code contained provisions that Connor Briggs had never read and would never read until the provisions were being read to him in a courtroom. No, this was more immediate. The toaster in the communal kitchen of The Lantern Hostel was a chrome relic of indeterminate origin, its brand name worn to a smear by years of backpacker abuse, and it had two settings: nothing, and inferno. Connor had inserted two slices of the hostel's complimentary white bread -- the kind of bread that existed in a quantum state between food and packing material -- and pressed the lever. The lever had refused to stay down. He'd pressed it again, harder. It had sprung back with a metallic complaint. He'd pressed it a third time, holding it with his thumb, and the element had glowed orange with a suddenness that suggested it had been waiting to do this, that the toaster had opinions about the people who used it and had chosen violence.

"Come on, you piece of--"

"Tekan sini."

The voice came from behind him, low and unhurried, and accompanied by a hand that reached past his elbow and pressed a small button on the side of the toaster he hadn't noticed. The lever clicked and held. The element settled into a steady glow. Toast commenced.

Connor turned. Mama Siti stood at the counter behind him, already back to her own station, already in motion, as if helping him with the toaster had been a thing that happened between moments rather than within one. She was small -- not just short but condensed, as if time had been slowly pressing her down toward the earth and she had responded by becoming denser rather than smaller. Her headscarf was white, clean, wrapped in a style that Connor couldn't have described but that looked deliberate and ancient, like a piece of origami that had been folded the same way for centuries. Her face was a landscape of lines -- deep grooves around her mouth, crow's feet that radiated from her eyes like the spokes of a wheel, the particular weathering of skin that has been exposed to tropical humidity and cooking steam for longer than most of the hostel's guests had been alive. She claimed to be sixty-eight. The building's foundations believed otherwise.

She was making nasi lemak, and the kitchen was her temple.

The hostel kitchen was a galley-sized strip of countertop, tile, and compromise, wedged between the common room and the air well courtyard. It contained one stove (gas, temperamental), one rice cooker (industrial, the only appliance that functioned without argument), a microwave that smelled permanently of someone's leftover curry, and a refrigerator whose interior represented a kind of archaeological dig through the dietary habits of a dozen nations -- jars of kimchi next to tubes of Vegemite next to plastic containers of something that might have been hummus or might have been a biohazard, all of it sweating in the tropical air whenever the fridge door opened, which was constantly. The kitchen was cramped, warm, perpetually crowded with backpackers trying to boil water for instant noodles or assemble sandwiches from ingredients they'd optimistically purchased at the 7-Eleven on the corner. It smelled of cooking oil and chilli and the ghost of a thousand meals.

But at 6 AM, before the backpackers stirred, the kitchen belonged to Mama Siti.

She had been there when Connor came downstairs, bleary-eyed, his hair a disaster, wearing the board shorts he'd slept in and a singlet that read CANGGU SURF CO. She was always there. She arrived at five, or she never left, or she materialised from the building's fabric like a spirit of the hearth -- the specifics were unclear and no one asked. What was clear was the food. The coconut rice was already steaming in the rice cooker, the sambal was bubbling in a small pot that seemed to be as old as she was, and the ikan bilis -- the tiny dried anchovies -- were frying in a shallow pan of oil, their bodies curling in the heat, filling the ground floor with a smell that was simultaneously fishy, nutty, and addictive. Roasted peanuts sat in a bowl. Hard-boiled eggs, halved, waited on a plate. Cucumber slices, cool and green, were arranged in a neat row on a cutting board.

She assembled a plate without being asked. She always knew who needed feeding. It was, Connor had decided during his seven days at The Lantern, one of the small miracles of hostel life -- that this ancient woman appeared every morning and produced food that was, objectively and without exaggeration, the best thing he'd eaten in any country, and that this food cost five ringgit, which was about a dollar fifty Australian, which was less than he'd pay for a bad coffee in Hawthorn.

She placed the plate in front of him. The nasi lemak was perfect: the coconut rice in a tight mound, glossy and fragrant, flanked by the sambal -- deep red, volcanic, flecked with dried shrimp and chilli seeds -- the anchovies crisp and golden, the peanuts scattered like small brown stones, the egg halved to show its pale yellow heart, the cucumber as an afterthought of freshness. It was beautiful in the way that food prepared by someone who has made the same dish ten thousand times is beautiful -- not arranged but inevitable, each element finding its correct position through the muscle memory of decades.

Connor ate. He made the sounds that the nasi lemak demanded -- small involuntary noises of gratitude that bypassed his brain entirely and came from somewhere deeper, somewhere that understood food in a way his conscious mind, with its Instagram filters and its #foodie hashtags, never would.

"Mama Siti," he said, mouth full, fork raised in a gesture of reverence, "this is unreal. Seriously. You could open a restaurant. You'd make a killing."

She didn't turn from the stove. She made a sound -- a soft exhalation through the nose -- that could have been acknowledgment or dismissal or both.

"I'm serious," Connor pressed. "Back in Melbourne, people pay thirty bucks for brunch that's half as good as this. You could charge whatever you wanted."

Now she turned. She looked at him with those dark eyes -- eyes that were not unkind but were very, very old, the kind of old that comes not from years alone but from having watched years pass over and over and over again, each one carrying away someone who sat where Connor sat now, eating what Connor ate now, saying what Connor said now.

"Ini bukan tentang wang," she said quietly. This is not about money.

"Yeah, nah, I know, but--"

"Orang yang tak tahu undang-undang," she said, and her voice changed. Not louder -- softer, actually, as if the words were being spoken from a distance, from a place behind her eyes where the kitchen and the hostel and the present moment were thin layers over something deeper. "Undang-undang tak tahu dia."

Connor paused, a forkful of sambal-drenched rice halfway to his mouth. "What's that mean?"

Mama Siti turned the stove down. The sambal stopped bubbling. In the sudden quiet, Connor could hear the morning call to prayer from Masjid Jamek, faint but clear through the air well, a human voice rising over the city in a melody that was simultaneously alien and familiar, like a memory from a life he hadn't lived.

She considered the question. Not the way people consider questions when they're translating -- she spoke English perfectly well, everyone knew that. She considered it the way a doctor considers how much to tell a patient.

"The man who does not know the law," she said, "the law does not know him."

Connor chewed. Swallowed. "Is that a good thing or a bad thing?"

She wiped her hands on the cloth that hung from her waistband, a slow and deliberate motion. "When the law comes," she said, "it does not ask if you know its name."

The words settled between them like something dropped into water, sending out ripples that Connor couldn't see and wouldn't feel until they reached the shore of a moment he hadn't arrived at yet. He blinked. The nasi lemak was getting cold. The call to prayer was fading. Mama Siti was looking at him -- really looking, the way you look at someone standing at the edge of a cliff who thinks they're standing on flat ground. Her eyes held something that wasn't warning, exactly, and wasn't pity, exactly, but sat in the unnamed space between the two where the old women of the world keep their most terrible knowledge.

"Hey," Connor said, "do you have any hot sauce?"

The look lingered. It lingered for one full second longer than was comfortable, long enough that a more attentive person might have felt the hairs rise on the back of their neck, might have put down the fork and said *What do you mean? What law? Why are you looking at me like that?* A second that contained, compressed within it, the full weight of everything Mama Siti knew and could not say directly, because prophecy, like cooking, had rules -- you could not force someone to taste what they refused to put in their mouth.

Then she reached behind her and produced a bottle of sambal from the shelf. She set it in front of him.

"You already have all the fire you need," she said.

She turned back to the stove. The sambal began to bubble again. The moment closed over itself like water, leaving no visible trace.

Connor upended the bottle over his nasi lemak, dousing it in additional chilli, and ate with the uncomplicated pleasure of a man who had been handed a prophecy and mistaken it for condiment advice. He finished the plate, left five ringgit on the counter, and headed upstairs to shower.

Mama Siti stood at the stove and watched the sambal turn in the pot, the same slow red circles it had been making since before this building was a hostel, since before the boy upstairs was born, since before the law he did not know was written on the paper he would never read.

She picked up his plate and washed it. She washed all the plates eventually.

---

Priya was waiting for him in the common room at nine, her battered Lonely Planet held against her chest like a shield, her round glasses pushed up on her forehead, her long braid swinging as she turned to face him. She was wearing jeans and a loose cotton shirt and trainers -- practical, appropriate, researched. She looked like she was going somewhere specific, which she was.

"I want to visit Masjid Jamek," she said.

"The what?"

"Masjid Jamek. One of the oldest mosques in KL. It's at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers." She said this the way she said most things -- with the quiet authority of someone who had read the relevant chapter. "It's beautiful. Mughal-style architecture. I've been wanting to see it all week."

Connor rubbed his wet hair with the sleeve of his singlet. "A mosque?"

"A mosque."

"Like a... praying mosque?"

Priya's expression performed a complex operation -- the smile that wanted to happen was intercepted by the eye-roll that deserved to happen, and the result was something in between: an expression of fond exasperation that Connor had become increasingly familiar with over the past seven days. It was the look she gave him when he said things that were not quite stupid enough to be offensive but not quite smart enough to let pass.

"Yes, Connor. A praying mosque. As opposed to the other kind."

"I just meant -- I'm not really a mosque guy. I'm more of a... beach guy."

"We're in Kuala Lumpur. There are no beaches."

"There might be."

"There are not." She tucked the guidebook under her arm. "Come with me. You'll like it. And you need to see something in this city that isn't a bar or a night market."

He should have said no. He had no interest in mosques, in architecture, in the history of a city he'd been in for a week and still thought of primarily as a backdrop for content. But Priya was standing there in the warm light of the common room, her dark skin luminous against the white of her shirt, her eyes bright behind the glasses that had slipped back down to the bridge of her nose, and she was asking him to spend the morning with her, and Connor Briggs was many things -- ignorant, reckless, dangerously incurious about the world he moved through -- but he was not immune to Priya Sharma.

"Yeah, go on then," he said.

They walked.

KL in the morning was a different beast from KL at night -- shopkeepers hosing down pavements, roti canai frying at corner stalls, the particular golden quality of equatorial morning light hitting old plaster. They followed the river past colonial-era buildings and through the edges of the financial district.

"KL means 'muddy confluence,'" Priya said, gesturing at the brown river below the bridge they were crossing. "It was literally named for the mud where these two rivers meet."

"That's sick," Connor said. "Like, literally muddy? Gross."

She rolled her eyes but smiled, and the smile was the thing he was after -- the crack in her composure, the moment where her curated intelligence gave way to something warmer. He collected those smiles the way he collected everything: casually, greedily, without understanding their value.

They approached Masjid Jamek from the south. The mosque sat at the actual confluence, the two rivers meeting at its feet -- white stone and onion domes and arched colonnades, salmon pink stripes catching the morning light.

"Wow," Connor said, and meant it.

"Built in 1909," Priya said. "Mughal and Moorish style."

"You memorised that?"

"I read a book, Connor. You should try it sometime."

They crossed to the entrance, where signs in Malay and English explained the rules for visitors. Priya had already read them. Connor had not.

He was two steps from the entrance when she caught his arm.

"Connor."

"What?"

She looked at him. Then she looked at his outfit. He followed her gaze. Board shorts. The Bintang Beer singlet. Flip-flops. The compass tattoo visible on his forearm. He looked like what he was: an Australian backpacker who had rolled out of a hostel and into a sacred space with all the preparation of a man stumbling into the wrong room at a party.

"You can't go in like that," Priya said. Her voice was patient but firm -- the voice of a medical student explaining to a patient why, no, they couldn't just take the bandage off because it itched.

"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?"

"Everything. Shoulders need to be covered. Legs need to be covered. No shoes inside. This is a mosque, not a beach bar."

"Seriously?"

"Seriously."

He looked at the entrance. A rack stood to one side, hung with folded garments -- robes for men, longer coverings for women -- provided by the mosque for visitors who hadn't come prepared. A sign above the rack, in English: PLEASE DRESS RESPECTFULLY. COVERINGS PROVIDED. Connor looked at the sign. For once, he actually read it.

"So I wear one of those?"

"They're sarongs and robes. Yes."

"Like a skirt?"

"Like a sarong. And you're a guest in their sacred space, Connor."

The words landed with a weight that Connor didn't expect. *A guest in their sacred space.* He thought about that for a moment. He was always a guest, everywhere -- that was the point of travel, wasn't it, being a guest in places that weren't yours? But he'd never thought about what that word actually meant. A guest had obligations. A guest behaved. A guest didn't walk into someone's house in flip-flops and a beer singlet and expect the house to accommodate them.

He was not, by nature, a man who was chastened. But Priya had a way of framing things that got through -- not by lecturing, not by shaming, but by presenting the reality so simply that even Connor's defenses couldn't find a way to deflect it.

"Right," he said. "Yeah. Fair enough."

He selected a robe from the rack -- pale green, long, lightweight cotton -- and pulled it on over his singlet and shorts. He removed his flip-flops and placed them on the shoe rack, where they sat among dozens of other pairs: leather sandals, trainers, delicate women's shoes, and his battered Havaianas, the most disreputable items in the collection by a considerable margin. Priya had already wrapped a scarf around her hair, borrowed from the women's section, and was adjusting it in the reflection of the glass door.

"How do I look?" Connor asked, holding out his arms. The robe hung to his shins, and with his sun-bleached hair and stubbled jaw and the green fabric draping loosely over his board shorts, he looked like a surfer who'd been press-ganged into a nativity play.

"You look appropriate," Priya said. "For once."

"Harsh."

"Accurate."

They stepped inside.

---

The interior of Masjid Jamek was cool -- not air-conditioned but the coolness of marble and shade and water, a building designed to shelter people from equatorial heat. After the furnace of the street, it was a physical relief.

Connor stood in the main prayer hall and felt something shift.

White marble columns rose to pointed arches, the geometry repeating in a rhythm that drew the eye upward toward the dome, where light entered through small windows and fell in soft shafts to the floor. Against one wall, the mihrab -- Priya murmured the word, indicating the direction of Mecca -- was decorated with geometric patterns in gold and blue, the kind of design that rewarded attention in a way that Connor's attention was almost never rewarded.

But the sound. From somewhere outside, ablution fountains were running -- a gentle splash of water on stone that entered the prayer hall as a presence rather than a noise. And woven through it: silence. Not the absence of sound, but the particular hush of a space consecrated for listening to something beyond human speech.

Connor stood still. This was rare. Stillness was not his natural state. But here, in the cool marble silence, something in him stopped. The constant, exhausting performance of being Connor Briggs fell away, and what was left was just a person in a beautiful building, breathing cool air, not filming anything.

Priya was watching him. Her borrowed scarf framed her face, and her expression was softer than the fond exasperation he was used to. She was seeing something in him that he rarely showed -- a capacity for genuine experience, for being present without trying to extract content from it.

The moment lasted perhaps thirty seconds.

Then Connor took out his phone, turned the camera on himself, and took a selfie with the dome behind him, angling his jaw to catch the light, deploying the travel-selfie face he'd perfected over four years and twelve countries: slightly squinted eyes, half-smile, chin tilted up. The prayer hall became a backdrop. The awe became content.

"Delete that," Priya said.

"What? Why?"

"Because this is a mosque, not a photo studio. And because the moment you had just then -- that real one, before the phone came out -- was worth more than anything you'll ever post."

Connor looked at her. She was serious. Not angry, not lecturing -- serious in the way that people are serious when they've seen something valuable being discarded.

He looked at the selfie on his screen. He looked good. The light was incredible. The dome behind him was perfectly framed. It would do well on the grid, definitely break a hundred likes, maybe more with the right hashtags -- #malaysia #mosque #travel #culture --

He deleted it.

He didn't know why. Something about Priya's face, something about the quality of the silence. He put his phone in his pocket and stood there, empty-handed, in a sacred space, genuinely present.

"Good," Priya said softly.

They stayed for another twenty minutes. Connor listened while Priya read the plaques and explained the architecture. He didn't retain much, but he listened, and listening was enough.

When they left, stepping back into the assault of heat and noise, he put his flip-flops on and hung the robe back on the rack and became, once again, a backpacker in board shorts squinting in the sun.

"Thanks," he said.

"For what?"

"I dunno. That was... yeah. That was something."

She took his hand briefly and squeezed it, and they walked back toward Petaling Street, and Connor did not film any of it, which was, by his standards, an act of extraordinary restraint.

He would not visit another mosque. The moment in the prayer hall would sink below the surface of his days, joining the other moments of genuine experience that accumulated beneath the performance of his life like coins at the bottom of a pool -- visible if you looked, unreachable if you didn't dive. But it had happened. And Priya had seen it.

---

The common room was full by eight o'clock, and someone had turned on the TV.

The screen -- perpetually smeared with fingerprints, its remote held together with tape -- was showing a documentary. Someone had been flipping channels and landed here by accident or inertia.

The documentary was about drug trafficking in Southeast Asia.

Connor was on the sofa, a Tiger in his hand, Priya beside him reading her guidebook, Jake on the floor scrolling his phone. Two Swedish girls occupied the armchairs. A solo Korean traveler sat cross-legged on the beanbag.

The documentary was well-made. The camera work was careful, the narration measured, the kind of production that had been funded by a European public broadcaster and took its subject seriously. It opened with aerial footage of the Golden Triangle -- where Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar meet -- the green hills and brown rivers filmed from above with a drone, beautiful and ominous. Then it moved south. Malaysia. Indonesia. The Philippines. The supply chains. The couriers. The arrests.

A map appeared on screen, red lines tracing drug routes through Southeast Asia. The narrator's voice -- British, female, steady -- explained: "Malaysia remains one of the world's strictest jurisdictions for drug offenses. Under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952, trafficking in certain quantities of controlled substances carries a mandatory sentence."

Cut to a courtroom. Malaysian. High-ceilinged, wood-panelled, a judge in robes, the formality of the setting absolute. A defendant in a dock. The camera didn't show his face yet -- just his hands, cuffed, resting on the wood in front of him. The narrator continued:

"The mandatory sentence for drug trafficking above threshold amounts -- as little as fifteen grams of heroin, or fifty grams of methamphetamine -- is death."

The common room was quiet. Not the comfortable quiet of before, but the tight, attentive quiet of people receiving information they didn't want. The Swedish girls had stopped talking. Jake's thumb had paused on his phone screen. The Korean traveler looked up from his beanbag.

The camera moved to the defendant's face.

He was young. Western. Maybe twenty-five, maybe younger -- hard to tell because his face had the collapsed quality of a person who has not slept in a very long time and has been crying and has stopped. His hair was light brown, overgrown. His eyes were fixed on something beyond the courtroom walls, something internal and unimaginable.

He looked like someone Connor might meet in a hostel.

The judge spoke. The subtitles translated: "This court finds the accused guilty under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. The sentence of this court is that you shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead."

The screen cut to exterior footage of a prison -- high walls, barbed wire, the Malaysian flag hanging limp.

Something cold moved through Connor's gut. Pre-thought. The body's own intelligence recognising threat before the conscious mind had finished constructing its denial. The young man on screen had blue eyes. Not quite the same blue as Connor's, but close enough.

For a synapse-thin fraction of a second, Connor saw himself in the dock.

The fraction passed.

Connor reached for the remote. It was on the sofa cushion beside him, half-buried under Priya's guidebook. He picked it up and changed the channel.

A football match appeared. Manchester City versus somebody. Green grass, running figures, the roar of a crowd. The screen flooded with colour and motion and the comfortable, comprehensible drama of sport.

"That's heavy, man," Connor said. His voice was light. His voice was always light. "Can we not?"

Jake, from the floor: "Yeah. Yeah, put the game on. Who's playing?"

"City, looks like."

"Sick."

The common room exhaled. Shoulders dropped. Someone reached for their beer. The two Swedish girls resumed their conversation. The Korean traveler returned to his book. The French couple drifted away. The documentary was gone, replaced by football, and the cold thing in Connor's gut receded, pushed down by the beer and the noise and the comfortable fiction that the screen now provided -- a world where the stakes were points and trophies and where nothing permanent ever happened.

Priya did not resume reading her guidebook.

She sat very still, looking at the side of Connor's face. Her expression was complicated -- layers of emotion stacked like geological strata, each one partially visible through the one above. Concern. Frustration. Something deeper and sadder that she couldn't quite name, the feeling you get when you watch someone walk toward an edge they can't see and you know that shouting will only make them walk faster.

She didn't say anything. Not yet. She turned back to the screen, where Manchester City was pushing forward on the counterattack, and she held her guidebook in her lap -- open, still, to the page about Malaysian law, the section about the Dangerous Drugs Act, the paragraph about the mandatory death penalty that Connor had never read and would never read and that was, at this moment, four inches from his right thigh.

He didn't look down. He watched the football. He drank his beer.

The documentary was gone. The young man in the courtroom was gone. The cold feeling was gone. Connor Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian, had been shown the truth -- clearly, directly, on a screen three meters from his face, in a language he understood, with subtitles -- and he had picked up the remote and changed the channel.

The thing about changing the channel is that it only changes what you see. It doesn't change what's there.

---

Connor and Priya sat on the mosaic bench in the air well courtyard at half past eleven, the red lantern casting its warm glow above them. The hostel was quiet -- that particular deep quiet of midnight, the layered breathing of dozens of sleeping strangers. Through the open rectangle of sky above, the faint suggestion of stars through KL's orange haze.

Priya was close beside him. Not touching, but close -- the careful proximity of two people who have been circling each other for a week. Her glasses were off, folded in her lap, and without them her face looked softer, younger. She was looking up at the sky.

"Connor," she said. "Have you looked into Malaysian laws? At all?"

"What, like jaywalking?"

Her eyes, without the glasses, were large and serious. "Like drug laws."

"Oh, come on--"

"They have the death penalty here, Connor. For trafficking. Mandatory. As little as fifty grams."

He sighed -- the defence mechanism, the sound that said *we're not doing this.* "Yeah, but that's for actual drug dealers. Kingpins. Not backpackers."

"That's not how the law works. It doesn't matter who you are."

"I'm not carrying any drugs," he said.

"I know. I'm just saying. Be careful. This isn't Australia."

"You worry too much."

She looked at him -- a long, searching look, the medical student's diagnostic eye at work. She wanted to ask about Felix. About the envelopes, the "side hustle," the RM200 deposits. But the evidence was circumstantial, and she didn't want to accuse, and she didn't want to ruin the moment.

Connor kissed her.

Partly because he'd wanted to for days. And partly to stop the conversation -- the questions getting closer to something he didn't want to examine, something that lived in the same territory as the cold feeling from the documentary, as Mama Siti's eyes across the kitchen counter. A kiss was a channel change.

She tasted of teh tarik and spearmint gum and herself, warm and alive in the red lantern light. She kissed him back with a tenderness that was also, underneath, a kind of grief, though he couldn't have known that and she might not have known it either.

They pulled apart.

Priya smiled. The smile was small and genuine and more complicated than any selfie could capture.

Connor smiled. His smile was larger, more confident, the smile of a man who had gotten what he wanted, which was both the kiss and the end of the conversation.

His phone buzzed in his pocket.

The vibration was a single pulse against his thigh -- short, insistent, unmistakably a text. He pulled the phone out, angled the screen away from Priya -- a reflex, automatic, the muscle memory of a man who'd been reading his phone privately for long enough that the gesture was invisible to him even when it shouldn't have been.

The screen lit up. A message from Felix:

*Morning job tomorrow. RM300 this time. Package, not envelope. Same deal. You in?*

Connor read the message twice. RM300. Nearly a hundred Australian dollars for a single delivery. That was more than his monthly social media client paid. That was breathing room.

The other thing -- *package, not envelope* -- sat in the message like a step on a staircase that was noticeably higher than the one before it. He did not examine the progression. He did not think about the young man in the courtroom documentary.

He looked at Priya, her face soft in the lantern light. She was trying to save him, and he didn't know it.

He texted back, holding the phone under the bench where she couldn't see:

*In.*

"Who was that?" Priya asked.

"Just Mum," Connor said. "Checking in."

The lie came easy. They always did. But this one was slightly larger, because it was told to someone looking at him with trust, in the warm dark, after a kiss that had meant something.

"That's sweet," Priya said. "Tell her you're being safe."

"I will."

He put his arm around her. She leaned into him. And somewhere on the third floor, Felix Decker watched the *In* message arrive on his screen and smiled the smile of a man whose machinery was working exactly as designed.
# Chapter 8: The Package

The box was on the table between the toast and the Vegemite.

Connor almost didn't see it. Felix had arranged the scene with the casual precision that characterized everything he did -- a plate of white bread toast, a knife, an open jar of Vegemite that he must have bought from an import store somewhere in the city because it damn well didn't come from the hostel kitchen, and there, slightly to the left, in a plastic bag from a 7-Eleven, a brown paper package about the size of a shoebox. Wrapped neatly. Taped shut. Unremarkable. The kind of thing you'd walk past in a post office without a second thought.

"Morning," Felix said.

He was sitting in the wicker chair by the common room window, where the morning light fell in a flat white sheet through the glass and made everything look like a photograph of itself. He was eating toast with the methodical, unhurried attention he brought to everything -- small bites, clean fingers, the knife wiped on a napkin between spreads. His linen shirt was fresh, his leather sandals clean. He looked like someone in an advertisement for a lifestyle that didn't exist.

It was just past nine. The common room of The Lantern Hostel had the drowsy, half-assembled feeling of a Tuesday morning in a backpacker hostel -- a French girl on the vinyl couch scrolling her phone, the ceiling fans turning with their eternal, futile patience, CNN murmuring from the wall-mounted TV about something happening in a country that was not this one. Through the arched doorway to the air well, the sound of Mama Siti's pans. The smell of coconut rice and sambal, threading through the humid air like a summons.

Connor had come downstairs in his board shorts and a singlet that said *GOOD VIBES ONLY* in faded block letters. His hair was still damp from the shower -- the one that ran lukewarm if you caught it before eight-thirty and cold after. His phone was at forty-seven percent. He'd checked Instagram before his eyes were fully open: eleven likes on last night's sunset photo from the pedestrian bridge, a comment from Jake that said "DUDE sick shot" with three fire emojis, and a DM request from a bot pretending to be a swimwear model. Standard morning.

"Is that Vegemite?" Connor said.

"I remembered you mentioned it. Found some at a specialty store in Bangsar." Felix pushed the jar toward him. "Consider it a professional courtesy."

"Mate. Legend. You absolute legend."

Connor sat down, reached for the bread, and began assembling toast with the focused pleasure of a man reunited with his national condiment. He spread the Vegemite thin -- he wasn't an animal -- and took a bite, and the salty, yeasty, deeply specific taste of home hit him with a force that was briefly, unexpectedly emotional. He thought of his mum's kitchen in Hawthorn, the white Formica bench, the jar of Vegemite that was always there, that was as fixed a part of the house as the walls. He swallowed.

Felix watched him eat. He had the patience for it. He had the patience for everything.

"So," Felix said, after Connor's third bite. "I've got a job for you."

Connor's eyes went to the plastic bag on the table. The brown paper package inside it.

"Same deal as before," Felix continued, as if he were describing the weather. "Delivery. Brickfields this time. Near KL Sentral." He nodded at the package. "Phone accessories. Chargers, cables, screen protectors. There's a distributor in Little India who sells them -- small electronics shop, wholesale operation. He orders in bulk from a supplier here in Chinatown, but the shipping takes forever and the couriers are unreliable. I've been helping him cut out the middleman."

The explanation arrived fully formed, pre-assembled, with the seamless logic of a story that had been told many times. Felix delivered it while buttering another piece of toast, his voice level, his eyes on the bread, the whole performance communicating one thing: *this is boring. This is mundane. This is beneath our attention.*

"Three hundred ringgit," Felix added. "Shouldn't take more than an hour."

Connor swallowed his toast. Three hundred ringgit. Ninety-something Australian dollars. For walking a box from Chinatown to Brickfields -- a distance he could have covered in twenty minutes on the LRT. He'd done two envelope deliveries for Felix already over the past few days, both smooth, both quick, both followed by the little buzz of a GrabPay notification that felt like the world tipping in his favor. RM200 each time. This was more. This was a raise.

"Three hundred?" he said. "For phone chargers?"

"Portable chargers. Power banks. Screen protectors in bulk. The box is heavier than you'd think." Felix smiled. The scar through his eyebrow caught the light. "The markup on accessories is insane. The distributor makes good money, so he pays good money to keep his supply chain moving. Simple economics."

"Yeah," Connor said. "No, yeah, that makes sense."

He reached across the table and pulled the plastic bag toward him. The package inside was wrapped in brown paper, the kind you'd find at any stationery store, sealed with clear packing tape in neat horizontal strips. No labels, no address, no return sender. Just a box, wrapped, anonymous. He picked it up.

The weight was wrong.

He knew it immediately, in the way the body knows things before the mind catches up -- the same way your hand pulls back from a hot surface before the pain signal arrives. The package was heavy. Not impossibly heavy, not suspicious-on-its-own heavy, but heavier than a shoebox of phone chargers and cables should be. He was holding maybe a kilo and a half, possibly more. The weight sat in his hands with a density that spoke of something packed tight, something compressed, something that occupied less space than its mass suggested.

"This is heavier than I expected," he said.

He said it casually. He heard it casually. But somewhere deep in the machinery of his nervous system, in the reptile brain where survival instincts lived, a wire tripped. A small electrical pulse, smaller than a thought, more like the shadow of one: *wrong*.

Felix didn't miss a beat. He never missed beats. Missing beats was for amateurs and the guilty.

"Power banks," he said. "Those things are basically bricks. Lithium batteries, yeah? Dense as anything." He took a sip of his instant coffee, holding the cup with both hands, unhurried. "I had to carry a box of twenty from Sim Lim Square in Singapore once. Nearly threw my back out."

Connor nodded. Of course. Power banks. Lithium batteries. Dense. He knew this -- he'd owned a power bank once, briefly, before leaving it at a guesthouse in Hoi An. Those things were heavy. Everyone knew that.

The wire in his reptile brain went slack. The shadow of the thought dissolved. The package was just a package, heavy because power banks were heavy, sealed because that's how you shipped things, anonymous because Felix's supplier was a wholesale operation and wholesale operations didn't bother with fancy labeling. The logic was clean, airtight, self-reinforcing. It was also a construction, built piece by piece over nine days of carefully dispensed trust, free beers, and Vegemite.

Connor put the package in his daypack. It sat at the bottom like ballast, adding weight, pulling the straps taut against his shoulders. He zipped the bag shut.

"Address?" he said.

Felix produced his phone, typed something, and sent it. Connor's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and read the message: a street name in Brickfields, a building number, and a single instruction.

*Back entrance. Metal door. Knock twice.*

"His name's Mr. Tan," Felix said. "He doesn't talk much. Don't take it personally -- he's just busy. Hand over the package, he'll check it, and you're done. I'll send the payment as soon as he confirms."

"Easy."

"Easy," Felix agreed. He raised his coffee cup in a small salute. "You're good at this, Connor. Some people overthink it. You just do it."

Connor grinned. The compliment landed where Felix intended it -- in the part of Connor that was hungry for validation, for the sense that he was good at something, that his casual, untethered approach to life was not a deficit but a talent. *You just do it.* Felix made it sound like a philosophy. Like something you'd put on a motivational poster, or a singlet.

"Back in an hour," Connor said, and headed for the door.

He passed through the narrow entrance corridor with the daypack riding heavy on his shoulders, the red paper lanterns glowing overhead in their perpetual amber procession. The phone repair shop on his left was already open -- the fluorescent light buzzing, the window display of cracked screens and coiled cables, and behind the counter, a man Connor had never properly looked at, sorting through components with quick, precise fingers. Wei. Not that Connor knew his name.

He stepped onto Petaling Street, and the city took him.

The walk from Chinatown to Brickfields was a lesson in KL's layers, though Connor wasn't the type to learn lessons that didn't come with likes and engagement.

He headed south along Jalan Sultan, past morning market stragglers packing up stalls -- vendors folding tarpaulins, hosing down pavement with water that ran brown into the storm drains. The air was already thick with heat, the humidity doing that thing it did in KL where you stepped outside and your body immediately began losing a fight it hadn't agreed to participate in. The daypack straps bit into his shoulders. The package sat at the bottom of the bag, a dense weight against his lower spine.

He passed the Guan Di Temple on the corner, incense drifting from its open doors. He passed a man drinking kopi-o at a marble-topped table outside a kopitiam, and for a moment Connor saw Felix in the posture -- the same unhurried confidence, the same sense of a man who knew exactly where he was.

He was filming. Phone in his right hand, narrating in the low, conspiratorial voice of his content persona: "Morning walk through Chinatown, KL. Day nine. This is what travel's about, guys. The real streets."

He was carrying a package of unknown contents toward a delivery address specified by a man he'd met nine days ago, and he was filming it for content. Connor's mind was a room with all the lights on and all the doors locked.

He turned onto Jalan Tun Sambanthan and the world changed. Chinatown fell away in the space of a single block.

Brickfields. Little India.

The transition was total. Chinatown's red-and-gold palette gave way to saffron and magenta and the electric blue of Hindu temple gopurams rising above rooftops like frozen fireworks. Sari shops lined both sides of the street, their storefronts hung with silk in every colour the eye could register -- emerald, vermillion, violet, a gold so bright it looked like it should be warm to the touch. Between them, garland sellers sat behind cascading displays of jasmine and marigold, the flowers strung on thread in thick ropes, the scent so sweet and dense it was almost narcotic. Tamil replaced Cantonese -- rapid, musical, a whole new frequency. A Hindi film song blared from a speaker above a sari shop with a volume that suggested the owner had confused music with a military offensive. Two women in salwar kameez walked past, their conversation a bright, overlapping duet that Connor couldn't parse but instinctively understood was gossip of the highest order.

And the food -- curry leaves frying in oil, the deep warmth of a biryani pot simmering since dawn, cardamom-laced chai steam rising from a streetside stall. Banana leaf rice restaurants were opening, long tables covered in fresh green leaves like place settings.

Connor filmed it all, turning in a slow circle on the pavement.

"Okay, this is insane," he said to his phone. "We've basically left one country and entered another. This is what I mean about KL, guys. Layers."

He walked deeper into the neighborhood, following Felix's GPS pin. Past a roti canai stall where dough stretched and spun in the air like a thin, wheaten planet.

He stopped at the garland sellers -- three stalls in a row, three women on low stools, their hands working with a speed that made the process invisible. Flowers in, garland out. Connor took a photo: brown hands against white jasmine, marigold garlands hanging in thick orange ropes behind. He'd caption it something about "the art of everyday life" or some other borrowed profundity.

"For the temple," one seller said, holding up a finished garland. "For prayer. You want?"

"Oh, nah, I'm not really--"

"Five ringgit."

Connor bought one. He had no temple to bring it to, no prayer to offer. But the garland was beautiful, and the jasmine smelled like something he couldn't name but wanted to be near. He draped it over his daypack strap, where it hung against the bag's grey fabric like a bright and fragrant rebuke.

Inside the bag, beneath the garland, the package sat dense and anonymous, waiting.

---

The address was on a side street off the main Brickfields drag, where the sari shops and restaurants thinned out and the buildings became more industrial -- low concrete structures with roller shutters, wholesale operations dealing in textiles, electronics, cleaning supplies. The street was quieter here. The Hindi music from the speakers didn't reach this far. A lorry was unloading boxes at a warehouse entrance, two men in work clothes passing cardboard cartons hand-to-hand with the rhythm of an assembly line.

Connor found the building. It was a narrow, two-story concrete structure with a roller shutter at the front -- currently down -- and a sign above it in English and Chinese: **GLOBAL TECH WHOLESALE SDN BHD**. An electronics wholesaler. Just as Felix had described. The sign was faded and the building was unremarkable, the kind of place you'd walk past without seeing, which was, of course, part of the arrangement.

He walked around to the back, as instructed.

The alley behind the building was narrow and shaded, the kind of space that existed between buildings in KL by accident rather than design -- a gap where rubbish bins sat and air-conditioning units dripped condensation and cats investigated things in the shadows. The ground was uneven concrete, cracked and stained. A steel door was set into the back wall of the building, painted grey, no handle on the outside. No window. No signage. Just a door, in a wall, in an alley.

Connor knocked twice.

He waited. The alley was quiet. He could hear the lorry at the warehouse a few doors down, the distant hum of traffic on the main road, a bird somewhere above him producing a sound like a squeaky hinge. The jasmine garland on his daypack strap was wilting already in the heat, the petals browning at the edges.

The door opened.

A man stood in the doorway. Middle-aged, Chinese-Malaysian, with close-cropped grey hair and a face that gave nothing away. He wore a white polo shirt and dark trousers and he looked at Connor the way you'd look at a package on your doorstep -- noting its presence without welcoming it.

"Hi," Connor said. "I'm here from Felix? I've got a delivery."

The man said nothing. His eyes dropped to Connor's daypack.

Connor swung the bag off his shoulder, unzipped it, and pulled out the brown paper package. He held it out. The man took it with both hands -- quickly, smoothly, the way you'd receive something you'd been expecting. He didn't thank Connor. He didn't make eye contact. He didn't step aside to reveal the interior of the building, which remained a dark rectangle behind him, lit by the blue-white glow of fluorescent tubes. Connor caught a glimpse of shelves, of cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling, of something that might have been a counter or a desk, and then the man stepped back and the door began to close.

The whole exchange took fifteen seconds.

The door shut with a click that was softer than Connor expected -- not a slam, not a statement, just a quiet, mechanical sealing of one space from another. Like an airlock. Like a mouth closing around something it didn't want to show you.

Connor stood in the alley for a moment.

Something bothered him.

He couldn't identify it. It wasn't the man's silence -- some people were quiet. It wasn't the back door -- wholesale operations often used rear entrances for deliveries. It wasn't the steel door itself, or the lack of signage, or the fluorescent light. It was something about the totality. The silence, the speed, the avoidance of eye contact, the door closing before he could see inside. It was the feeling you get when you're watching a movie and the music changes key and you know something is about to happen even though nothing on screen has changed. A tonal shift. An atmospheric pressure drop.

*That was weird,* Connor thought.

And then his phone buzzed.

He pulled it from his pocket. A GrabPay notification.

**RM300 received from F. DECKER**

Three hundred ringgit. The number sat on his screen in the clean sans-serif font of financial apps, simple and undeniable. Ninety-something dollars. For walking a box through a colorful neighborhood and handing it to a man through a steel door. The discomfort in his chest -- the tonal shift, the atmospheric pressure drop -- receded like a tide going out. Not disappeared. Receded. The difference was important, because disappeared would have meant it was resolved, and receded meant it was still there, under the surface, waiting for the next thing to bring it back.

But Connor didn't do subtext. Connor didn't do undercurrents. Connor lived on the surface of his life the way a water strider lives on the surface of a pond -- entirely, confidently, and with no understanding whatsoever of the depth beneath him.

He pocketed his phone, walked out of the alley, and stopped for a teh tarik at a streetside cart, drinking it in three long gulps. He paid with a five and told the vendor to keep the change, feeling generous and expansive -- an identity he could afford now.

The garland on his daypack had given up entirely, jasmine petals browning and dropping from the string. He plucked it off and draped it over a bollard. A small offering, left by a man who didn't know he was praying.

---

He walked back through Brickfields toward Chinatown, passing KL Sentral where commuters streamed in and out in office clothes and reusable coffee cups. Connor moved through them like a different species -- board shorts, flip-flops, daypack, man-bun. Two worlds, occupying the same pavement, going in opposite directions.

He was feeling good. Better than good. Seven hundred ringgit total now, from three deliveries over four days. That was more than his parents sent him in a week. That was financial independence, or something close to it.

He crossed a main road and on the far side, a police officer was standing on the corner.

He was standing the way Malaysian police officers stand -- feet apart, hands behind his back, the posture of a man who has been given a post and intends to occupy it with maximum visibility. He wore the dark blue uniform of the Royal Malaysia Police, peaked cap pulled low, and he was speaking on his phone, his free hand resting on his belt near the holstered baton. He was not looking at Connor. He was looking at nothing in particular. He was just *present* -- a uniform, an authority, a representative of a system that Connor did not understand and had never tried to.

The officer glanced up as Connor passed.

Connor's stomach dropped.

It was instant, involuntary, and total -- a flash of fear so pure and primal it bypassed every cognitive filter he'd built and hit him in the gut like a physical blow. His hand tightened on his daypack strap. His pace quickened by a half-step. His vision narrowed for a fraction of a second, tunneling, the officer's blue uniform becoming the only thing in his visual field, everything else -- the traffic, the pedestrians, the bus, the orange-sticky kid -- falling away into peripheral noise.

His body knew. Without language, without logic -- adrenal glands firing, heart rate spiking, muscles tensing along the flight pathway. The ancient mammalian hardware preparing to run from a predator it had identified before the thinking brain registered the threat.

Then the thinking brain caught up: *I'm not carrying anything.* The package was delivered. The bag was empty. He was clean.

Connor's hand loosened on the strap. He smiled at the officer. The officer didn't smile back -- his eyes lingered a moment and moved on. A non-event.

Connor walked on. He didn't explore the connection between the flash of fear and the package he'd just delivered, between the adrenal spike and the brown paper and packing tape and the weight that was wrong. He didn't ask himself the question his nervous system had just asked and answered in the space of a heartbeat: *Why would an innocent man be afraid of a police officer?*

He walked on, because Connor Briggs walked on from everything -- from warning signs and proverbs and guidebook sections and women who tried to tell him things -- and the walking on was not a conscious strategy but a reflex, as automatic and as doomed as the rabbit that freezes in headlights and then bolts too late.

Two blocks later, the fear was gone. Not resolved -- gone. Overwritten by the smell of satay, the brightness of the sky, the pleasant weight of RM300 in his digital wallet.

He stopped on a pedestrian bridge and leaned against the railing. The Towers caught the late morning light to the east. Below him, traffic poured through an intersection in streams of color and noise. He was absolutely certain he was winning at life -- the certainty of a man who had never once stopped moving long enough to check whether the ground beneath his feet was solid.

---

That evening, Connor was on the vinyl couch, phone in hand, scrolling Instagram.

He'd showered, eaten Mama Siti's nasi lemak (she'd looked at him again with that expression he couldn't read, the one that seemed to come from a long way away), and settled in with the comfortable heaviness of a man who'd earned his evening. Priya was in the kitchen making tea. They hadn't talked about last night's kiss yet. Everything was later with Connor.

His thumb moved through the feed on autopilot -- swipe, pause, double-tap. Sunsets, flat-lays, hostel memes. He drifted into the Explore page, Instagram's algorithmic underworld, where the app served you content based on your pauses and taps and the things you looked at two seconds longer than other things.

A post caught his eye.

The account was @HostelReaper.

Connor's thumb stopped. He recognized the name -- the graffiti on the wall in Chinatown, the day he'd arrived with Jake and Priya. The black marker, the small reaper icon, the words *Check-in is optional. Check-out is not.* He'd photographed it. Called it "sick street art." Hadn't thought about it since.

The profile picture was a black square. No bio, no highlights. Just a grid of posts -- backpacker gear in empty spaces.

The post in his Explore feed was a photo of a backpack sitting on an empty bus seat. Blue and grey, medium-sized, centered in the frame as if someone had placed it there and then ceased to exist. Flat fluorescent light. No people. No reflections. Just the bag, alone.

The caption: *Another one packed for the journey. #NoReturn #101Ways*

The discomfort from the delivery -- the steel door, the weight, the police officer -- flickered in Connor's chest. A pilot light of anxiety.

He looked at the photo for three more seconds. Then he scrolled.

The next post was a girl in a bikini on a beach in Bali. Connor double-tapped. A red heart bloomed.

The @HostelReaper post was already gone -- scrolled past, pushed down by algorithms and the devastating efficiency of a thumb on glass. Gone, like a proverb spoken in a kitchen. Like a name carved in wood.

---

The dorm was dark.

Connor lay in Bed 7, bottom bunk, the mattress foam thin enough to feel the wooden slats beneath. The ceiling fan clicked overhead -- the off-balance blade, the irregular metronome, counting out the night in its broken rhythm. The room smelled of insect repellent and damp wood and the faintly sweet rot of an old building in a wet climate. Through the air well opening at the far end of the room, the sounds of the city settling: a motorcycle, distant, fading. A television in another dorm, volume low. The breathing of other sleepers in other bunks, the private sounds of unconscious bodies, undisturbed. The tick of the building cooling, contracting, doing whatever old buildings do when the humans inside them sleep.

His phone buzzed.

The screen lit up in the darkness, painting his face blue-white, illuminating the wooden bed frame above him, the slats, the underside of the mattress, the graffiti carved and written by travelers past. He held the phone close to his face, squinting.

Felix.

*Good work today. You're a natural, Connor. I've got something bigger coming up -- more money. Let me know when you're ready.*

Connor read the message twice. *Good work. Natural. More money. Ready.* Each word a compliment, a validation, a small brick in the edifice of a version of himself that he wanted to believe in. Felix saw potential in him that his parents didn't, that his sister didn't, that the yoga studio in Northcote that paid him $150 a month to run their Instagram certainly didn't.

The screen's glow caught the wooden bed frame inches from his pillow. There, in the grain of the dark wood, five letters had been carved with something sharp -- a key, a knife, a fingernail pressed hard enough to leave a mark in the soft timber. The letters were small and careful, the work of someone who had been trying to be quiet, who had carved in the dark, in this bed, in this room, while the ceiling fan clicked above them the way it clicked above Connor now.

**LENA**

The light from his phone fell across the name for two full seconds. The L and the E and the N and the A were illuminated in blue-white, each letter distinct, each groove visible. The name of a twenty-two-year-old Swedish girl who had slept in this bed, who had met a charming European man in this common room, who had carried packages for that man through these streets, who was now in Kajang Prison waiting for a trial that would not go well. The name was right there. It was inches from Connor's face. All he had to do was turn his head slightly to the left. All he had to do was look.

Connor did not look. He was looking at his phone. He was composing a reply.

He typed a thumbs-up emoji and hit send.

The screen went dark. The room went dark. The name went dark, sinking back into the wood grain, invisible, patient, carved into the architecture of the bed frame like a footnote in a book no one was reading.

Somewhere on the third floor, in the private room he paid triple for, Felix Decker noted the thumbs-up emoji and updated a spreadsheet on his laptop. The spreadsheet had columns for names, dates, amounts, and reliability ratings. Connor's reliability rating had just been upgraded from 3 to 4. The scale went to 5. No one had ever reached 5. Lena had been a 4 when they arrested her.

Connor put his phone on the mattress beside his pillow, rolled onto his right side, and closed his eyes.

Sleep came quickly, as it always did for Connor. He had the gift of the unburdened mind -- the ability to pass from wakefulness to sleep without the intermediate purgatory of reflection that kept so many people staring at ceilings in the dark. No review of the day, no accounting of choices, no inventory of things that might have been done differently. Consciousness to unconsciousness in sixty seconds, like a light switch being flipped. Like a door closing.

In his sleep, Connor dreamed. A grey room, windowless, fluorescent. His blue travel towel in his hands, wrapped tight around something dense. He couldn't see what. Someone behind him he couldn't turn to see -- not wouldn't, couldn't, the dream's logic walling off the action like a locked door. The towel constricting, the microfiber pulling taut. The light buzzing louder. The presence closer. His fingers white-knuckled and unable to let go.

He woke gasping, heart hammering, sheets damp. The ceiling fan clicked its broken rhythm. The dream was already dissolving -- grey walls, a buzzing light, something in his hands, someone behind him -- falling apart even as he tried to hold the images. Within thirty seconds the dream was just a feeling. Within a minute the feeling was just a heartbeat. Within two minutes, nothing.

He reached for his phone by reflex, then stopped. The screen would light up and the blue-white glow would find Lena's name in the wood grain, though Connor didn't know this and would never know it, because he had never looked at the bed frame closely enough to see.

He closed his eyes. The fan clicked.

By morning, the dream would be gone. Only his body would carry it -- a bruise below thought, pulsing once before it too faded.

The law doesn't require your belief. That's what makes it the law.

Connor slept. The name waited in the wood.
# Chapter 9: The Map of the Dead

The door was behind reception, and Connor had walked past it every day for eleven days without seeing it.

This was not difficult. The door was the same colour as the wall -- a mottled cream that had once been white, softened by decades of tropical damp into something organic, something that looked less like paint and more like skin. There was no sign on it, no handle visible from the common room side, just a thin vertical line where the door met the frame, hairline-thin, barely distinguishable from the cracks that ran through the plaster like the building's own nervous system. If you didn't know it was there, it was a wall. If you did know, it was a door. This was the kind of detail that said something about Uncle Razak, though Connor would never work out exactly what.

It was mid-morning on Day 11, and Connor was in the common room eating Mama Siti's nasi lemak with the reverent focus of a man who had discovered religion through coconut rice. His phone was propped against a water bottle, filming the plate at an angle that made the banana leaf look like an artifact from an undiscovered civilisation. He was composing the caption in his head -- *When the hostel aunty's cooking is so good you consider permanent residency* -- when Uncle Razak appeared.

"Appeared" was the right word. Razak had a way of being in a room that bypassed the conventional mechanics of arrival. One moment the common room contained Connor, his nasi lemak, and the background furniture of hostel life -- the bookshelf, the jigsaw puzzle, the TV showing a cooking competition in Mandarin. The next moment there was also a man of approximately sixty-three years standing beside the reception desk, as though the building had generated him from its own substance.

Uncle Razak bin Omar was a large man made small by posture -- broad-shouldered, barrel-chested, his thick scarred hands hanging at his sides like tools he no longer quite needed. His face was round and deeply creased, the skin darkened to mahogany by six decades of equatorial sun, and when he smiled the creases deepened into something that looked genuinely warm. He wore a batik shirt in blues and browns, loose cotton trousers, and plastic sandals. Reading glasses hung from a cord around his neck.

"Connor!" He said everyone's name like that -- with the exclamation mark audible. "Come, come. You have finished eating? I want to show you something interesting."

He reached behind the reception counter, found a point on the wall that looked like wall, and pushed. The door opened inward on silent hinges, revealing a narrow corridor lit by a single bulb, and beyond it, a room. "My office."

Connor followed. The corridor was barely two metres long, the air different here -- cooler, drier, carrying the particular smell of newsprint ageing in a humid climate. Not quite mould, not quite dust. The olfactory equivalent of sepia.

Razak's office was small. A wooden desk scarred by decades of use, piled with papers and ledgers and a laptop so old it might have been the communal Dell's grandfather. A leather chair, cracked, the stuffing leaking from one arm. A reading lamp with a green glass shade casting amber across the desk. A shelf of books lined up with a collector's neatness: *The Backpacker Murders*, *Death Abroad*, *Hostel: The True Stories*, *Missing Persons of Southeast Asia*. All true crime.

But it was the walls that stopped him.

Every surface that wasn't shelf or door was covered. Newspaper clippings, dozens of them, pinned directly to the plaster in overlapping layers -- some yellowed to the colour of old teeth, some recent enough that the ink was still sharp. Different languages: English, Malay, Thai, German, French, Indonesian. Headlines visible even in the low light:

*FIRE IN BUDAPEST HOSTEL KILLS 4 -- FAULTY WIRING BLAMED*

*BACKPACKER DIES IN BARCELONA BALCONY FALL -- RAILING FOUND DEFECTIVE*

*METHANOL POISONING IN VANG VIENG: 5 TOURISTS HOSPITALISED, 3 DEAD*

*CAPE TOWN BACKPACKERS' MURDER: SUSPECT ARRESTED*

Some clippings had handwritten notes in the margins -- dates, names, annotations in Razak's cramped script. Some were circled in red pen. Some had single words: *avoidable*, *covered up*, *no investigation*.

And on the wall behind the desk, dominating the room the way the Petronas Towers dominated the skyline: a map.

Large -- at least a metre wide -- a standard Mercator projection stuck with red pins, small and round-headed. Connor's eyes moved across the continents: three pins in Western Europe, two in Eastern, five across South America, one in Australia, two in Africa. And Southeast Asia -- Southeast Asia was a constellation. The pins there were so dense they overlapped, a cluster of red dots marking Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Thirty pins in that region alone. Maybe forty. Each pin had a small paper tag dangling from it by thread: a name, a year, a cause.

*Bangkok 2014 -- CO. Quito 2017 -- Fall. Phnom Penh 2019 -- Methanol. Siem Reap 2016 -- Drowning. Pai 2012 -- Motorbike.*

Connor stood in the doorway and stared. The map covered the entire wall. The red pins were like a disease, spreading outward from a central mass in Southeast Asia, thinning at the edges of the world but never disappearing entirely. There were pins in Alaska. There were pins in New Zealand. Wherever people slept in shared rooms in foreign countries, the red pins followed.

"Sit, sit," Razak said, squeezing past to his desk. He lowered himself into the leather chair with the deliberate care of a man whose knees had opinions. "I'll make tea."

From a shelf hidden behind papers, he produced two metal cups and a warm kettle and performed a trick Connor had seen in hawker stalls but never in an office. He raised one cup above his head and poured the tea in a long, arcing stream into the cup held at waist height -- the liquid falling in a smooth amber rope, foaming as it hit the surface. He switched hands, pouring back, the stream longer this time, a full arm's length of liquid suspended in air, catching the desk lamp's light like a thread of gold. Back and forth, three times, four, the foam building on the surface.

"Teh tarik," Razak said, setting a cup in front of Connor. "Pulled tea. The secret is the height. The higher you pour, the better the foam." He smiled. "In the old days, the tea stall operators on Petaling Street would compete to see who could pull the highest. Two metres, three metres. The champion was a man named Ah Beng who could pour from a stepladder and not spill a drop. He's dead now. Heart attack. But the tea lives on."

The teh tarik was sweet, milky, rich -- condensed milk and strong black tea, the foam on top thick enough to leave a moustache.

"This," Razak said, nodding at the walls, "is my collection."

He sipped. He let the word settle.

"Fifteen years ago, a boy died in a hostel in Chiang Mai. Carbon monoxide from a faulty water heater. He went to sleep in the shower and never woke up." Razak pointed to a pin in northern Thailand. "The hostel covered it up. Filed it as a heart attack. The family never knew the truth. Nobody else records them, Connor. The hostels cover them up. The police file them away. But I remember."

His finger moved across the map. "Bangkok, 2014. Three dead -- carbon monoxide, faulty heater. A whole dorm. An American, a Briton, a Canadian. The hostel changed its name and reopened three months later." Another pin. "Quito, 2017 -- a girl, Swedish, twenty-two. Fell from a fourth-floor balcony. The railing had been loose for months. Guests had complained." Another. "Phnom Penh, 2019 -- methanol in the rice wine. Five backpackers poisoned, two survived. The bar closed. Another opened in the same location six weeks later, different name."

Connor leaned forward, both hands around the teh tarik, eyes moving between Razak's face and the map. He was fascinated. Not with the weight of it, not with the accumulation of preventable death. Connor was fascinated the way he was fascinated by anything with narrative potential. He was seeing content. He was seeing posts. He was seeing a thread, a series, a story that his 4,200 followers would find darkly compelling.

"Uncle," he said, "this is sick."

Razak looked at him.

"Like, in a good way. How many pins are on there?"

"Sixty-seven. That I know of. The real number is higher. Hotels keep records. Hostels keep secrets."

"Can I photograph the map?"

He was already reaching for his phone, already framing the shot -- the red pins catching the desk lamp's light, the handwritten tags like tiny epitaphs. He'd caption it: *The death map. Uncle Razak at The Lantern Hostel has been tracking backpacker deaths for 15 years. Every red pin is someone who didn't come home.* The hashtags wrote themselves.

Razak hesitated. Then he waved his hand. "Sure, sure."

Connor took six photos from different angles. Close-ups of the Southeast Asian pins. A wide shot of the whole map. Detail shots of the tags.

"You should start a podcast, Uncle. Seriously. 'Deaths in Hostels.' True crime is massive right now. You'd get a huge following."

Razak sat behind his desk, watching Connor photograph the dead the way you'd photograph street art. "These are real people, Connor."

"No, yeah, totally. That's what makes it so powerful. Every pin is a story. You could do an episode per death. That's a Netflix series right there."

Razak looked at him for a long time. The expression on his face was difficult to categorise -- something between pity and disgust, with recognition underneath. He'd seen this type before. The bright, confident young traveler who walks through the world seeing everything as raw material, every human experience as something to be captured and captioned and posted for strangers who will scroll past it in three seconds.

He offered more tea. He changed the subject.

---

"The building has been many things," Razak said, refilling Connor's cup with the theatrical pour.

"Built in 1928. A Hokkien textile warehouse. Then the Japanese came." The word settled in the room the way a heavy stone settles in water. "1942 to 1945. This building was used as an administrative office. That's the official record." He paused. "Unofficially, people went in and did not come out. The old neighbours call it *rumah tangisan*. The house of crying. You've seen the Japanese characters on the second-floor landing? Under the paint?"

Connor had. He'd walked past them every day without thinking about what they said.

"After the war, the Lim family reclaimed the building, but they didn't live here. Nobody wanted to live here. They rented the ground floor to a businessman who ran a gambling den through the fifties and sixties. Mahjong, mostly. Illegal, of course, but this was Chinatown in the old days -- the police came for tea and left with their pockets full." He chuckled, but the chuckle was thin. "Then a brothel in the seventies. Women from Indonesia, the Philippines, some local." He touched the desk. "This was the madam's room. The blue tiles in the hallway -- she chose those. After the brothel closed, the building sat empty for twenty years. When I renovated, we found things in the walls. Japanese military buttons. Old mahjong tiles. A woman's shoe." He tapped the desk. "Every use leaves something behind. The building doesn't forget."

Connor's phone was in his hand, filming. "That's content gold, Uncle. Seriously. You could do ghost tours. 'The Haunted Hostel of Petaling Street.' Charge fifty ringgit a head."

Something moved in Razak's expression -- something tired and faintly nauseated. The expression of a man watching someone use a gravestone as a selfie stick.

"The building has seen enough commerce. It doesn't need to sell its dead."

He poured more tea. Changed the subject with the practised redirection of a man who had been a host for seventeen years. Then he set down his cup and said, very quietly:

"Be careful who you trust in this city, Connor. Not everyone who smiles at you is your friend."

The words sat between them. The desk lamp flickered -- a momentary brownout in the old wiring -- and the newspaper clippings on the walls seemed to shift.

Connor smiled. "You're alright, Uncle. Everyone here is awesome."

Razak watched him go. He didn't finish his tea. He didn't stand. He sat behind his desk in the amber light, in his small room papered with the dead, and looked at the map. His eyes found a pin in Kuala Lumpur -- one among many, unremarkable, positioned right where they were sitting. The tag read: *KL 2025 -- Custody.* A girl. Swedish. Twenty-two. The name he never said aloud. Lena. The name that was also scratched into the wooden frame of Bed 7, where Connor slept every night without seeing it.

Razak had known about the trafficking network for years. He had known about Felix -- not this Felix specifically, but the Felixes, the succession of charming Europeans who passed through Chinatown with too much cash and too little luggage, who befriended the lonely and the broke. He had made his arrangement: they don't recruit from his hostel, he doesn't call the police. The arrangement had protected him. It had protected his guests. It had worked, in the way that all bargains with the dark work -- as long as nobody looked at it too closely.

Felix had broken the arrangement. Felix had recruited Connor from inside the hostel, from the common room, from under the red lanterns that Razak had hung with his own hands. And Razak had told Connor to be careful, and Connor had smiled, and the arrangement was broken and there was nothing left to do but sit in the amber light and know what was coming and not stop it.

He reached for his tea. It was cold.

---

The Petaling Street night market was a different creature after dark.

The harsh daytime fluorescents were supplemented by strings of LED lights -- white, blue, orange -- that turned the canopy into a low-slung galaxy. Food stalls dominated: charcoal smoke rose through the lights like fog, carrying the smell of satay and char kway teow and the caramelised edges of frying popiah. Chinese opera music drifted from a tinny speaker, the falsetto wail rising and falling over the crowd noise like a bird circling above a forest.

Connor walked through it with Priya on his left and Jake on his right, and for a suspended half-hour, nothing else existed. The press of the crowd was warm and chaotic -- tourists with cameras, locals with shopping bags, children darting between legs. The calls of vendors layered over each other in Cantonese and Mandarin and English: "Hey, you want bag? Good price!" "Best watch, real leather!" "Makan, makan, come eat!" The air was thick with charcoal smoke and frying oil and the sugary tang of shaved ice being drizzled with syrup at a dessert stall.

He was generous with his money -- Felix's money. The RM700 from three deliveries sat in his account like a small promotion, lifting him from anxiety to ease. Two envelopes and a package, delivered without incident, without a single question about what he was carrying or for whom. The money changed who he was. It made him the person he wanted to be: the one with his hand in his pocket, the one who said "I've got this."

At the clothing stalls, he pulled a fake Supreme t-shirt from a rack -- white, with the familiar red box logo across the chest. The lettering was slightly too thick and the tag said SUPPREME if you looked closely, which no one would.

"How much?"

"Thirty."

"Twenty-five."

The vendor, a young woman scrolling her phone, didn't look up. "Fine."

Connor dropped the money on the counter. "There you go, mate. Early Christmas present."

Jake held the shirt up against his sunburned chest. "Dude. You didn't have to do that."

"I know. I'm a legend. Put it on."

Jake pulled his old shirt off right there in the market and pulled on the fake Supreme, and several vendors watched this display with the practised indifference of people who had seen far stranger things on Petaling Street.

At a jade stall near the temple end, Connor stopped. Small table, green velvet, trays of jade jewelry in shades from nearly black to the pale translucent colour of new leaves. He pointed at a bracelet -- thin, delicate, deep forest green.

"How much?"

The vendor held up three fingers.

"Try it on," he told Priya.

"Connor, no--"

"Just try it."

She picked it up. The jade was cool against her dark skin, vivid green against brown. She turned her hand, watching the light move across the stone's surface. The bracelet was slightly too large, sliding toward her knuckles, and she pushed it back -- a small, unconscious gesture, the gesture of a woman who has already imagined owning this thing.

"Done." Connor handed the vendor fifty ringgit. "Keep the change."

"You don't need to buy me things," Priya said, in the tone of someone simultaneously touched and annoyed.

"I know. I want to."

She looked at the bracelet on her wrist. She pushed her glasses up -- the diagnostic gesture. Then: "Thank you." Her voice was different. Simpler. The irony stripped away.

The bracelet cost thirty ringgit -- about ten Australian dollars. A sum that had come from an envelope delivered to a man in Bukit Bintang whose name Connor didn't know, on behalf of a German whose business Connor didn't question. The jade sat on Priya's wrist like a small, green promise, and it was beautiful, and it was paid for with money that was not clean, and neither of them knew this.

They ate satay. A vendor at the market's edge was working a charcoal grill, the coals glowing orange-red, plumes of smoke spiralling into the LED lights above. Thirty sticks of marinated chicken, peanut sauce thick enough to stand a skewer in, compressed rice cake, cucumber wedges. They stood at the counter and ate with their hands and didn't speak because speaking would have been an interruption. They drank fresh coconut water from green coconuts hacked open with machetes -- the juice cool and faintly sweet, cutting through the richness of the satay.

Then Jake announced he needed a watch.

At the stall, he pointed at a gold Rolex Submariner.

"Eighty ringgit," the vendor said.

Jake straightened up, his face set in borrowed seriousness. "I watched a TED Talk about negotiation. You say eighty, I say twenty, we meet in the middle." He paused. "So. I'll give you a hundred."

The vendor blinked. Looked at Connor. Connor shook his head. The vendor looked back at Jake.

"One hundred ringgit," he said. "For a watch I was selling for eighty. Deal."

He took the note with the delicate speed of a man pocketing a miracle.

Priya laughed. Not the measured, ironic half-laugh she deployed for Connor's jokes, but a real laugh -- full and sudden and surprised out of her, her head tipping back, her hand going to her mouth, her glasses sliding down her nose. Jake started laughing because Priya was laughing, and Connor started laughing because the night was warm and the market was beautiful and Priya's laugh was the best sound he'd heard in twelve countries.

For a moment -- brief, specific, unrepeatable -- everything was perfect. The three of them stood under a canopy of LED lights and charcoal smoke, laughing about a fake watch, and the Guan Di Temple glowed red and gold at the end of the market with incense smoke rising from its open doors, and somewhere a speaker played Chinese opera in a high, wavering voice that sounded like it was singing about something that had happened a long time ago and would happen again.

Connor reached for Priya's hand. She let him take it. Her fingers were cool from the coconut water, and the jade bracelet slid against his wrist as their hands interlocked. She was watching Jake try to take a selfie with his new watch -- an operation requiring both hands, which Jake was solving by holding the phone in his teeth. She was smiling. Not the diagnostic smile. Just smiling.

Connor held her hand and felt, with a clarity that surprised him, happy. Not content. Not performing happiness for an audience. Just happy, the way a glass is full, the way a room is warm.

He would think about this moment later. In a room without windows, under a light that never turned off, he would close his eyes and try to find his way back to this market, this smoke, this hand in his hand. He would try, and he would almost succeed, and then the door would open and the trying would stop.

But that was later. Now the night was young, and Priya's hand was in his, and the red and gold glow of the temple lit the smoke above the market like something sacred.

---

They walked home through the darkening streets after eleven.

The night market was contracting -- a galaxy collapsing back into ordinary matter. Metal shutters rolled down with bangs and clatters that echoed off the shophouse facades. Vendors packed fake designer goods into cardboard boxes with the practised speed of people who did this every night. The food stalls were the last to close, their grills still smoking, their fluorescent tubes still buzzing, a few last customers eating standing up with the hurried focus of people aware that the night was ending. The LED light strings went dark section by section, and the market's galaxy collapsed back into a corridor of shuttered stalls and swept pavement and the lingering smell of charcoal and peanut oil.

Jake walked ahead, filming a TikTok of himself in slow motion with his fake Rolex extended toward the camera, his narration audible from ten metres away: "When you're balling on a budget in KL. Link in bio for discount designer watches. Not sponsored but should be."

Connor and Priya walked behind, still holding hands. The street was quieter now, reduced to its nighttime essentials: a motorcycle parked at an angle, its engine ticking as it cooled; a cat picking through a rubbish bag; the distant bass of a club on Changkat, felt more than heard.

They turned the corner onto the hostel's street. The Guan Di Temple was closed, its red doors shut, but incense still leaked from the gaps, sweet and lingering. The traditional Chinese medicine store was dark, its jars of dried things invisible behind the glass. And next to it, Wei's phone repair shop.

The light was on.

The fluorescent tube cast a flat, blue-white light onto the pavement -- the kind of light that made everything it touched look slightly ill. Through the cluttered window display -- cracked screens, coiled USB cables, a handwritten sign reading REPAIR CHEAP FAST -- two figures were standing at the counter inside. One was Wei, the quiet Chinese-Malaysian man in his forties Connor had seen every day, always bent over a phone with a magnifying glass. The other was Felix.

Connor stopped walking. Felix was leaning forward, hands flat on the counter. Wei was opposite, also leaning forward. Between them, on the surface, something Connor couldn't quite make out through the glass -- a shape. It could have been a phone. It could have been a box. Their body language was not customer and shopkeeper. It was the tense, focused intensity of a negotiation, or a briefing -- two men discussing something that mattered.

Connor raised his hand and waved.

Felix looked up.

For one second -- too brief for analysis, too long for comfort -- Felix's face was not the face Connor knew. The warm smile was absent. The easy charm was absent. What remained was something Connor had never seen on Felix's features: flat, still, and cold. Not angry. Not surprised. Just empty. The way a shop window is empty after closing, the displays removed, the lights still on but illuminating nothing.

Then the second passed. Felix raised a hand -- not a wave, a half-gesture, an acknowledgement -- and his mouth moved in something that stopped short of a smile. He turned back to Wei. He did not come to the door. He did not call out. He did not do any of the things Felix always did when he saw Connor.

Connor's hand was still raised. He lowered it.

"What's Felix doing in there?" Jake asked, appearing beside them.

"Probably getting his phone fixed. His screen's been cracked for weeks."

Felix's phone screen was not cracked. Connor had seen him using it that morning, the screen perfectly intact. He knew this, and he said the other thing, and the lie came out smooth and easy, because lying about something you don't want to think about isn't lying -- it's management. The management of a reality you haven't decided to examine yet.

Priya said nothing. She'd looked at the phone shop when Connor stopped. She'd looked at Felix through the glass, at the counter between them, at the posture of two men who were not discussing phone repairs. She'd looked at Connor's face when Felix didn't wave back -- the brief confusion, the quick smoothing-over, the lie that came too easily. She saw something, or the beginning of something, or the shadow of something that hadn't fully formed. But she didn't say it. She held Connor's hand, and she walked, and the jade bracelet was cool on her wrist.

---

Bed 7 in Dorm 3 at midnight was a coffin of foam and vinyl and the breathing of strangers.

Connor lay on his back, staring at the underside of the bunk above him -- the stickers, the carved graffiti, the ghost of a Che Guevara someone had tried to scrape off. The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.* Through the air well, a motorcycle in the distance. Then silence. Then a cat. Then silence again.

He thought about the night market. Priya's hand in his, warm and then cool. Her laugh -- real, unguarded, the kind of laugh that breaks out of a person rather than being performed by one. The jade bracelet, green against brown, sliding on her wrist. Jake's face, guileless and happy, strapping on his overpaid watch with the satisfaction of a man who believed he'd won.

He thought about Uncle Razak's map. Sixty-seven red pins. He could still see the Southeast Asian constellation, thick as a rash. He thought about the pin in Kuala Lumpur -- Razak tapping it with his thick finger, saying quietly: "This one is nearby. A girl. Swedish. Last year." He hadn't elaborated. Connor hadn't asked. The Swedish girl. The pin. The cause of death -- *Custody* -- a word he hadn't thought about, hadn't connected to anything, hadn't allowed to mean what it meant.

He thought about Felix.

The thought arrived clearly, like a bubble rising from deep water. It broke the surface of his mind and sat there, perfectly formed: *What if Felix isn't what he says he is?*

He examined it. He turned it over. He held it up to the light.

Then he popped it.

*Felix is a legend. Felix is my mate. Felix gave me RM700 for basically nothing. That's not sketchy, that's generous.* Felix paying cash for everything? He's European; Europeans use cash. Felix's private room for two months? He values his space. Felix's too-good stories? He's been travelling for years. Felix's cold expression through the phone shop glass? Connor caught him off-guard. Everyone looks weird when they're caught off-guard.

*It means nothing. It all means nothing.*

The rationalisation was smooth and fast and complete, a machine of self-deception so well-oiled it ran without friction. Each doubt was met by a counter-doubt. Each shadow was chased by a spotlight. The machine hummed, and the doubt dissolved, and Connor was left with the warm residue of certainty.

He turned over. The mattress squeaked under him. He thought about Priya's hand because that was warm and good, and the other thing -- the thought about Felix, the cold expression, the phone shop at eleven PM -- was cold and uncertain and would, if he let it grow, threaten everything warm and good.

So he didn't let it grow. He did what he always did with uncomfortable information. He changed the channel. He swiped left on the truth and right on the story he preferred, and the algorithm of his own mind delivered exactly what he wanted: reassurance, comfort, the conviction that everything was fine.

Everything was fine. Everything was absolutely fine.

He closed his eyes. Sleep came slowly, then all at once. He didn't dream. The building dreamed for him -- its old wood creaking, its pipes humming, its ghosts walking corridors that had been corridors for a century, past the Japanese characters on the second-floor landing, past the blue tiles the brothel madam had chosen, past the hidden door to Razak's office where sixty-seven red pins marked sixty-seven stories that had ended badly.

At seven-fifteen the next morning, his phone buzzed on the mattress beside his head. He reached for it with his eyes still closed.

A text from Felix.

*Big day tomorrow. Come find me.*

Connor read it. He smiled. He put the phone down. He rolled over.

Outside, the call to prayer rose from Masjid Jamek, long and wavering, reaching for something above the rooftops and the wires and the heat. It washed over the building and asked the same question it asked every morning, five times a day, a question that had been asked in this city for centuries:

*Are you awake? Are you listening? Do you know where you are?*

Connor was not listening. He was already asleep again, dreaming of night markets and jade bracelets and the faces of people who smiled at him, and not one of those faces, not one, belonged to the man who was going to get him killed.
# Chapter 10: Comfortable

---

The call to prayer came at 5:32 AM, as it always did, rising from the minarets of Masjid Jamek in a long, wavering note that threaded through the pre-dawn dark and found its way up the air well and through the walls of Dorm 3 and into the shallows of Connor's sleep. He heard it the way you hear rain on a window when you're warm in bed -- not as information, not as meaning, but as texture. Background. Part of the room. Part of the city. Part of what KL sounded like when you'd been there long enough that the unfamiliar had become furniture.

He rolled over, pulled the pillow across his ear, and sank back down.

When he woke again it was ten fifteen, and the heat had already settled into the dorm like something that paid rent. The ceiling fan turned overhead -- *tick, tick, tick* -- stirring the air without conviction. Through the air well, the sounds of the city rose in the familiar sequence: motorbike engines, the rattle of metal shutters going up on Petaling Street, Mama Siti's wok hitting flame in the kitchen below, and somewhere, a mynah bird making its single-note declaration into the wet morning air.

Connor lay in Bed 7 and let the sounds wash over him. He didn't reach for his phone. Not immediately. Not the way he had in the first week, when the notifications were the first pulse of the day, the proof that the outside world still knew his name. Now his phone was just there, face-down on the thin mattress beside him, and the notifications could wait because the morning could wait because everything, for the first time in four years of movement, could wait.

He was comfortable. That was the word. Not happy, exactly -- happiness was too active, too demanding. This was something more dangerous: the feeling of a man who has stopped running and found that nothing was chasing him. The panic of the first week -- the money panic, the 3 AM arithmetic on the ceiling -- had receded like a tide pulling back from shore. He was settled. He had a routine. The routine had its own gravity, and gravity doesn't feel like a trap. Gravity feels like the ground.

He swung his legs off the bunk. Dressed in the order he always dressed: board shorts, singlet -- today's read SUNSET CHASER in a font manufactured in Guangzhou -- flip-flops, leather bracelet, phone in left pocket. He splashed water on his face in the second-floor bathroom where the shower head dripped its permanent percussion onto tiles the colour of old teeth.

By the time he reached the kitchen, Mama Siti had his nasi lemak waiting.

She didn't greet him. She hadn't greeted him since day three. The banana leaf was already plated -- rice, sambal, anchovies, peanuts -- assembled with the offhand precision of someone who had made this particular constellation ten thousand times. Connor placed a five-ringgit note on the counter. It vanished. He ate with his fingers the way she'd silently taught him by the fourth morning, and thought about nothing at all.

Out the front door. Past the phone repair shop -- Wei's shop -- where the fluorescent light was on and a figure hunched over the soldering bench inside. Connor walked past without looking. He'd stopped looking weeks ago. Whatever he'd seen that night -- Felix in the shop, the way Felix hadn't waved back -- had been absorbed into the sediment of things-that-didn't-matter, compacted beneath the days that followed.

He bought a roti canai from the mamak stall on the corner. Ate it standing up, watching the market unfold: stall holders shouting in Cantonese, tourist couples consulting phones, the old man with the bird cages who sat in the same spot every morning outside the temple. Connor knew this man now. Not his name, just his presence. KL was becoming legible in a way no city had before -- not in words, but in the way your body learns a room in the dark.

At eleven, his phone buzzed.

Felix: *Got one for today. Package to Jalan Ipoh. RM300. Grab at the usual.*

Connor typed back without breaking stride: *On it.*

He collected the package from Felix's room on the third floor. Brown paper, taped shut, roughly the size of a hardcover book. Felix handed it over the way you hand someone a book you've already read: casually, without ceremony. "Jalan Ipoh. Number 47. Ask for Mr. Tan." Connor slid it into his daypack without weighing it in his hand, without asking what was inside, without thinking about it at all.

The delivery took forty minutes. Grab to Jalan Ipoh. A shophouse with a metal roller door half-raised. A man took the package, examined the tape seals, nodded once. No handshake. No small talk. The brisk efficiency of a machine completing a cycle.

Connor's phone buzzed: RM300 transferred.

Banking app in the back of the Grab: RM4,280. He was earning faster than he was spending. Connor Briggs, who had never saved a ringgit in his life, was saving money. He closed the app and posted a photo of his morning roti canai -- "#streetfood #kualalumpur #digitalnomadlife" -- without a trace of irony.

This was his fourth delivery. Two envelopes, two packages. RM700 total. He barely thought about it anymore. The deliveries had migrated from the category of *unusual things I do* to the category of *things I do*, which was a shorter journey than it sounded. First you do something strange. Then you do it again. Then it's not strange. Then it's not even something you do -- it's just something that happens, automatic as breathing. The normalization was total. The normalization was the point.

He went to Grind Culture. RM14 flat white, but now the RM14 didn't sting. Scheduled three posts for Pacific Soul. Scrolled job boards he had no intention of applying to. At two, he met Priya at the Central Market. They ate ice kacang from a stall outside, the shaved ice melting in the heat, and she told him about a patient she'd seen on placement -- a man with motor neurone disease, completely lucid, completely trapped -- and Connor listened in the way he'd learned to listen to Priya, which was not the way he listened to anyone else.

That evening he emailed his parents.

He sat on Bed 7 with his laptop balanced on his knees, the ceiling fan ticking overhead, and composed the kind of email he sent once a fortnight -- breezy, reassuring, carefully emptied of any information that might cause concern.

> Hey Mum & Dad,
>
> KL is amazing!! Seriously loving it here. The food is incredible, the people are so friendly, the city has this energy that's hard to describe. I've been doing some freelance work (social media stuff) and picking up a few local gigs so the finances are actually pretty solid for once. Been exploring the whole city -- temples, markets, even went to a mosque (don't worry, I was respectful!). Made some great friends at the hostel including this really cool girl from London who's doing medicine.
>
> Thinking I might actually stay here for a few months. It's that good. Don't worry about me -- I'm eating well, sleeping well, and being smart. Promise.
>
> Love you both. Tell Megan I said hi (she won't care but tell her anyway).
>
> Connor x

He read it back. It contained three lies, four omissions, and one truth. The truth was that he was thinking about staying for months. The omissions were Felix, the deliveries, the packages, and the RM4,280 in his account that came from carrying things for a man whose income source he had never asked about.

He hit send. Connor was thinking about extending his Malaysian visa.

---

The common room was nearly empty at three in the afternoon -- the dead hours, when the morning travelers had left for their activities and the night travelers hadn't yet stirred. The ceiling fans turned. The TV was off. The red lanterns cast their permanent warm glow across the battered furniture and the bookshelf where *The Beach* had been replaced by *The God of Small Things*, as though the bookshelf had a curriculum.

Connor was on the sofa, scrolling his phone, doing the kind of nothing that takes complete attention. Priya was in the armchair across from him, her Lonely Planet on her lap, not reading it. She was watching him. He could feel it -- the pressure of being watched by someone who sees you clearly -- but he hadn't looked up yet because looking up meant acknowledging the thing that had been sitting between them for two days, the thing that had no name but had a shape, the shape of a question that Priya had been carrying and Connor had been avoiding.

"Connor."

He looked up. She was pushing her glasses up her nose -- the gesture she made when she was about to say something careful.

"Yeah?"

"Can I ask you something?"

"Always." He smiled. The Instagram smile. Confident, easy, bulletproof.

"Those deliveries you do for Felix."

The smile held. The thing behind the smile -- the thing that was not a smile at all but a wall built from charm and eye contact -- went up another six inches.

"Yeah? What about them?"

"What exactly is in the packages you carry?"

He'd been ready for this. Not consciously, but some deeper mechanism -- the survival engine that ran beneath his awareness -- had been assembling the answer for weeks. It came out smooth and warm and so reasonable it almost convinced him.

"Phone accessories. Chargers, cables, that sort of thing. Felix does consulting for import businesses. I'm basically a courier."

"Have you ever opened one?"

"No. Why would I? They're sealed for the client."

"Don't you think that's odd?"

"What's odd about it?"

Priya set the Lonely Planet down on the armrest. The rubber bands that held it together shifted, a small sound in the quiet room. She leaned forward, elbows on her knees, and looked at him with an expression he recognised from the cave at Batu -- the doctor's patience, the willingness to wait for the truth to surface on its own.

"Connor, don't you think it's odd that he won't let you see what you're carrying? That the packages are always sealed, always taped shut? That you never meet these clients in a normal place -- it's always the back of a shop, or a loading dock, or a man at a door who takes the package and closes the door?"

"It's business, babe. Confidentiality. This is how import-export works."

"It's not how import-export works." Her voice was level, controlled -- the voice of someone who had spent three years of medical school learning how to deliver information that patients didn't want to hear. "Normal businesses use courier services. DHL. FedEx. Pos Laju. They don't use backpackers carrying brown paper packages across the city by Grab."

The word *backpackers* landed wrong. He felt it in his chest -- not as logic, not as argument, but as insult. He wasn't a backpacker being used. He was an entrepreneur seizing an opportunity. There was a difference. He was certain there was a difference.

"You don't know Felix," he said.

"I know what this looks like."

"And what does it look like, Priya? What does it look like to you?"

He hadn't meant his voice to harden. It hardened anyway. The warmth between them -- the warmth that had been building for two weeks, through Batu Caves and night markets and afternoon walks and the particular intimacy of two people learning each other's rhythms -- cooled by several degrees in the time it took to finish the sentence.

Priya held his gaze. Behind the round glasses, her eyes were steady and dark and holding something that was not quite fear and not quite anger but was close enough to both that the distinction didn't matter.

"It looks like something I've read about," she said. "In the guidebook. In the news. It looks like something that happens in this part of the world to people who don't ask questions."

"Right. Because you read it in a guidebook, that makes it real. Meanwhile, I've actually been doing this. I've met Felix. I've done the deliveries. Nothing has happened. Nothing dodgy, nothing weird. Just a bloke paying me to carry phone accessories because his regular driver isn't always available."

"Connor--"

"You don't know Felix. Not the way I do. He's a photographer. He does import-export on the side. He's been nothing but good to me. And frankly--" He caught himself. The sentence had been heading toward *it's none of your business*, which was the one thing he knew, even in this moment, would break something that couldn't be fixed. He diverted. "Look, I appreciate you caring. I do. But I've been doing this for four years. Traveling, living on my own, dealing with people. I know how to read people. Felix is good people."

Priya was quiet for a long time. The ceiling fan turned. Somewhere on the second floor, a door closed. Through the air well, the sound of the afternoon call to prayer began, distant and beautiful and completely meaningless to the man on the sofa who was too busy defending his own blindness to hear anything at all.

"Okay," she said. Not agreement. Surrender of a different kind -- the surrender of someone who has extended a hand and had it pushed away and knows that extending it again will only make the refusal permanent.

She picked up her Lonely Planet. Opened it to a page she wasn't going to read. The rubber bands snapped softly against the cover.

Connor picked up his phone. Opened Instagram. Scrolled through a feed of sunsets and flat whites and people pretending their lives were curated.

Between them, in the warm amber light of the common room, a crack had appeared. It wasn't visible. It didn't make a sound. But both of them felt it -- the particular silence that descends when two people have stopped talking about the thing that matters and started performing the pretence that everything is fine.

They sat like that for twenty minutes. Then Priya closed the guidebook, said "I'm going to shower," and left the room without looking at him.

Connor watched her go. He felt a flash of guilt -- or the shadow of guilt, the pressure drop before a storm. He pushed it down. He was good at pushing things down.

*She's overthinking it. She's a med student. They're trained to see pathology everywhere.*

The rationalisation machine ran. It had been running since he was eighteen and dropped out of university and told his parents it was a *conscious choice*. It had been running every time someone told him something he didn't want to hear and he converted their concern into their problem. The crack between him and Priya didn't close. But he stopped looking at it, which amounted to the same thing.

---

Tomoko Sato did not sit down.

She appeared in the common room forty minutes after Priya left, while Connor was still on the sofa, still scrolling. She came from the staircase -- the third step squeaked -- and walked to where he was sitting and stood over him with her arms crossed.

No camera today. Plain black T-shirt, cargo pants, the red-tipped hair dark and damp. Her expression was the one she always wore -- neutral, watchful, the face of someone who had decided long ago that charm was a weapon.

"Connor. I need to say something."

He looked up from his phone. "Sure. What's up?"

"Your friend Felix."

The words landed like coins on a counter. Connor's jaw tightened. Two conversations about Felix in one afternoon. The universe apparently had opinions.

"I've seen men like him before," Tomoko said. "In Myanmar. In Laos. In the Philippines. They're always charming. They always have money. They always have a private room. They always need 'someone reliable.'"

She said *someone reliable* with quotation marks made of voice, the inflection precise and deliberate, like a scalpel unwrapping suture silk.

Connor sat up straighter. "And what exactly are you saying?"

"I'm saying be careful. The people Felix knows are not who he says they are. The money he has is not from photography."

"You don't know Felix."

"I know his type."

"His type? What, German?"

The joke -- if it was a joke -- fell into the silence and died there. Tomoko's expression didn't change. She had the particular stillness of someone who had stood in front of warlords and corrupt officials and was not going to be deflected by an Australian in a singlet attempting sarcasm.

"Dangerous," she said. "I'm saying his type is dangerous. I've watched him since the first week. The cash. The packages. The people who come to the hostel at night and go to the third floor and leave before morning. The way he looks at you when you're not looking at him."

Connor felt something cold move through his chest -- a quick, involuntary contraction, the body's honest response to a truth the mind had not yet processed. The way he looks at you when you're not looking at him. For a half-second, the image surfaced: Felix in Wei's shop, bent over the table, not waving back. The camera-flash memory of something seen and immediately unseen.

He pushed it down. The machine ran.

"Look, I don't know what your problem is with Felix. He's my mate. He's been nothing but good to me. He's helped me out when I was broke, he's introduced me to people, he's--" Connor heard himself building the case and felt the familiar heat of defensive certainty, the kind that burns hottest when you're defending something you haven't examined. "And frankly, it's none of your business."

Tomoko looked at him for a long moment. The ceiling fan turned overhead. Through the air well, the mynah bird sang its one note.

"I've said what I came to say," she said.

She walked away. Her footsteps were quiet on the cracked tiles. The third step didn't squeak on the way up -- she knew where to place her feet, the way someone who watches everything learns the geography of a building's betrayals.

Connor watched her go and felt the guilt arrive faster this time -- a hot bloom in his stomach. *She's just uptight. She's probably jealous she didn't think of the side hustle herself.*

The rationalisations came, each one thinner than the last, like cards from a deck running out.

*Felix is a photographer. It's import-export. The packages are phone accessories. I've done four deliveries and nothing has happened. Nothing has happened. Nothing has happened.*

He said it three times because repetition is how spells work, and what Connor was doing -- what he had been doing since the first envelope -- was casting a spell on himself. An incantation of normalcy. A prayer to the god of she'll-be-right. And the god answered, as that god always does, by making the thing you're afraid of invisible for a little while longer.

He went upstairs to shower. Stood under the cold spray and felt the two warnings -- Priya's face, Tomoko's voice -- circle each other in his mind like fish in a bowl, going around and around, never arriving anywhere. The water ran. The warnings dissolved. He towelled off with the blue Sea to Summit and went to meet Priya for dinner as though nothing had happened, because the definition of *something happening* was one he controlled, and he had decided that this wasn't it.

---

The rooftop at night was the place where Connor went to feel like the person he performed on Instagram.

The plastic chairs. The clothesline swaying empty. The Petronas Towers between the shophouse roofs and the snarl of electrical wire, silver and luminous against the dark. It was after eleven. Priya had gone to bed early. They'd had dinner at the Indian place on Jalan Tun Sambanthan -- the conversation warm but careful, two people navigating around the thing they'd argued about.

She'd kissed him goodnight at the door to Dorm 4. A brief kiss, her hand on his arm. Then the door closed and he'd stood in the hallway trying to name the feeling in his chest, which was something between gratitude and loss, like holding a cup you know you're going to drop.

Now he was alone. He had a Tiger, bought from the cooler behind reception, RM8, paid for with Felix's money -- though Connor didn't think of it as Felix's money anymore. It was his money. He'd earned it. It was all just logistics. Just moving things from one place to another.

He called his mother.

She picked up on the second ring. She always picked up on the second ring -- never the first, never the third. By the third ring the anxiety would have already started, the quick inventory of worst-case scenarios that mothers run in the time between the second ring and the voicemail.

"Connor! Are you alright?"

She always started with this. Not *hello*, not *how are you*, but *are you alright*, as though every phone call from her son was potentially the one where everything had gone wrong.

"I'm fine, Mum. I'm great, actually. Just sitting on the hostel roof looking at the Petronas Towers."

"Oh, lovely. I've seen photos. They look enormous."

"They are. Like, properly massive. You can see them from everywhere in the city. It's like they're watching you."

"That's a bit creepy, darling."

He laughed. "Nah, it's beautiful. KL's beautiful. I wish you could see it."

"Well, your father and I were saying just the other day that we should do a trip. Maybe next year. When you're -- well, wherever you are next year."

The sentence snagged on the word *wherever*. Connor heard the weight of it -- the gentle, careful weight of a mother who had learned not to ask *when are you coming home* because the answer had stopped changing and had started hurting.

"How's Dad?"

"Oh, he's fine. Playing golf on Saturdays, which you'd think would be enough, but now he's joined a Tuesday group as well. I think he's avoiding the garden."

"Tell him I said g'day."

"I will. Oh -- Megan got a promotion. She's some sort of senior analyst now. At that firm in the city. She's very pleased."

"Good for Megs." He said it and meant approximately forty percent of it. The other sixty percent was the complicated alloy of jealousy and guilt and defensive dismissal that Megan's achievements always produced in him -- the reminder that the Briggs family conveyor belt was still running and he was the only one who'd stepped off.

"And how are you, really?" Karen said. "Are you eating properly? Sleeping?"

"Mum, I'm eating the best food of my life. There's this woman at the hostel -- Mama Siti -- she makes this coconut rice thing every morning. It's unbelievable."

"That's nice, love. And you're being careful? Your father saw something on the news -- one of those current affairs programs -- about drug crime in Malaysia. Something about trafficking. It sounded quite frightening."

The word *trafficking* arrived on the rooftop like a cold draught through an open window. Connor felt it move across his skin and then felt himself close the window.

"Always careful, Mum. You know me."

"I know you *think* you're invincible," she said, with the particular tone of a mother who has been watching her child walk toward edges since before he could walk, who has spent twenty-seven years calculating the distance between his confidence and the ground. "I just want you to be safe, Connor. That's all I ever want."

"I'm always safe, Mum. Promise."

He meant it. He genuinely, completely, profoundly meant it. He was sitting on a rooftop in a city he'd come to love, drinking a beer, talking to his mother, and the sincerity of his promise was total and unperformed and that was what made it devastating -- not that he was lying, but that he believed absolutely in the truth of a statement that could not have been more wrong.

"I love you, darling."

"Love you too, Mum."

"Call me next week? On Sunday, if you can. Your father will be home."

"Will do."

"Goodnight. Or -- good morning? I always get confused with the time difference."

"It's night here, Mum. Late."

"Well, get some sleep. And eat your vegetables."

He laughed. "There aren't a lot of vegetables in Malaysian food."

"Then find some. Goodnight, Connor."

"Night, Mum."

The call ended. The screen went dark. Connor sat with the phone in one hand and the beer in the other and felt something expand in his chest -- a warmth different from the humid air, different from the beer. It was the warmth of being loved without conditions, without performance -- uncomplicated, unearned, the kind that came from Melbourne and arrived intact despite twelve time zones. His mother loved the real him -- the boy who'd skinned his knees in Hawthorn, the teenager who'd failed chemistry. She loved the man on the rooftop, though she had no idea that the man she loved was carrying packages for a trafficker and calling it logistics.

He thought about Priya, asleep two floors below. Jake, at a bar on Changkat. The hostel -- the red lanterns, the squeaking third step, Mama Siti's kitchen. The building that had absorbed him the way it absorbed everyone, offering warmth and the gentle narcotic of belonging.

He thought about none of the things he should have been thinking about.

*This is the life,* Connor thought. *This is what people back home will never understand. This right here. The rooftop and the skyline and the warm night and the beer and the money and the girl and the friends and the hostel that feels like home. Everything is exactly right. Everything is exactly where it should be.*

He finished his beer. He sat for a while longer -- not thinking, not performing, not curating. Just being. A man on a rooftop in a country whose laws he'd never read, in a building that had been a warehouse and a military office and a gambling den and a brothel and was now the place where Connor Briggs had found the thing he'd been looking for without knowing he was looking for it.

Comfort. The most dangerous thing in the world.

He went downstairs at midnight. Climbed into Bed 7 and pulled the blue towel over his chest and lay there in the dark, listening to the ceiling fan tick and the air well breathe and the city hum its endless, indifferent hum.

He was happy. Not the performed happiness of Instagram, but the quiet, real, dangerous happiness of a man who has mistaken the floor of a trap for solid ground.

It was the last time he would feel this way.

---

Morning. Day 15.

The knock came at six AM, while the call to prayer was still echoing across the rooftops. Connor was deep in sleep. The knock pulled him up through layers of unconsciousness and deposited him in the real world with a jolt. The dorm was grey with early light. The ceiling fan turned. The French guy above was a motionless lump.

Three raps. Precise. Patient.

Connor swung his legs off the bunk, rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, and shuffled to the door. He was in his board shorts, shirtless, his hair a construction of sleep and humidity. He opened the door and squinted into the hallway.

Felix was there.

Clean shirt, linen shorts, leather sandals, the scar on his eyebrow catching the grey light. But something was different. The usual Felix -- the smiling Felix, the one who made you feel chosen and warm -- was not entirely present. In his place was something leaner, as though the charming surface had been peeled back to reveal the mechanism beneath. His eyes were steady and held none of the social warmth Connor had come to expect. They were the eyes of a man at work.

"Morning, Connor." His voice was calm, measured, the German accent a little more pronounced than usual, the way it got when Felix was being precise rather than performing. "Got something different for today. Can we talk on the roof?"

Connor blinked. "What time is it?"

"Just after six. Sorry for the early start."

"Yeah, mate. No worries." He yawned, scratched his jaw, tried to assemble his face into something that looked awake. "Give me five."

"Of course." Felix inclined his head -- a small, European gesture that managed to convey both patience and expectation. "I'll be up there."

He turned and walked down the hallway. His footsteps were quiet. The third step didn't squeak.

Connor closed the door. The call to prayer was fading through the air well, the muezzin's voice thinning to silence.

He pulled on a singlet -- GOOD VIBES ONLY, soft and thin from washing in hostel sinks across three countries. Flip-flops. Phone from the mattress.

On the way out, he steadied himself against the bunk frame with one hand, his fingers wrapping around the wooden edge as he ducked under the upper bunk. His palm pressed flat against the wood. His fingers curled over the rail. Beneath them, carved into the grain by a fingernail or a key or the desperate edge of a coin, were five letters: L-E-N-A.

He didn't look down. He didn't feel the grooves. His hand was there for a second, maybe two, and then it was gone and he was in the hallway and the door was closing behind him and the name was behind him, unseen, unread, unfelt.

The way it had been since the first night. The way it would stay.

He climbed the staircase -- the third step squeaked -- and pushed through the rooftop access door. The Petronas Towers caught the early light, silver against the brightening sky.

Felix was standing at the zinc railing. He didn't turn. His posture was relaxed but not casual -- the posture of a man who has arranged things and is waiting for the next arrangement to begin.

"So," Connor said, dropping into a plastic chair, "what's up?"

Felix turned. He looked at Connor for a long moment -- the kind of look you give something you've been building when you've finished the foundation and are ready to start on the walls. Then he smiled. The smile was thinner than usual, more efficient -- a smile that existed to facilitate a transaction rather than create warmth. The mask was thinner today. Connor didn't notice, because Connor had never noticed the mask.

"I've got something a bit different," Felix said. "Something bigger. Better money. But I want to explain it properly."

He pulled up a chair and sat across from Connor. Behind them, the Petronas Towers watched. Below, the city moved.

Part 1 ended here, on a rooftop in Kuala Lumpur, with the call to prayer fading and the morning light growing and a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in a GOOD VIBES ONLY singlet sitting across from the man who was going to get him killed, waiting to hear what came next.

He waited the way he did everything: confidently, carelessly, with the serene certainty of a person who had never once in his life imagined that the ground beneath him might not hold.
# Chapter 11: The Upgrade

The rooftop at six in the morning was a different country.

The plastic chairs were beaded with dew -- the overnight condensation that settled on every surface in KL like a tax levied by the climate. The clothesline hung empty, its nylon cord sagging between two poles in a curve that caught the first grey light. The Petronas Towers were silhouettes against a sky the colour of dishwater, their silver cladding not yet lit, their twin forms rising into the low cloud like something waiting to be revealed. Below, the city was stirring but not yet awake -- the distant diesel cough of a bus on Jalan Sultan, the metallic clatter of a shophouse shutter going up too early, and from somewhere close, the last trailing note of the Fajr call to prayer from Masjid Jamek, thin and wavering and ancient, fading into the hum of air-conditioning units on a hundred rooftops.

Connor sat in the plastic chair, shirtless, in board shorts and flip-flops, his hair a monument to the night's humidity. His singlet -- GOOD VIBES ONLY -- was balled in his fist because putting it on had seemed like too much commitment at six AM. The air was warm but not yet aggressive, the brief window between the cool of pre-dawn and the furnace-blast of a KL morning. In two hours the sun would turn the zinc roof into a griddle. Now it was almost pleasant.

Felix stood at the railing. He'd pulled two Tiger beers from somewhere -- cold, sweating, the kind of gesture that was so perfectly timed it felt rehearsed. He set one on the arm of Connor's chair without asking.

"Beer at six AM?" Connor said.

"It's a special occasion."

"What occasion?"

Felix turned from the railing. The scar on his eyebrow caught the early light. He was wearing a clean white linen shirt, untucked, sleeves rolled to the elbow. His leather sandals looked new. Everything about Felix looked deliberate in a way that Connor admired without examining -- the way you admire a building's architecture without wondering about the foundation.

"I've been thinking," Felix said. "About you."

"Flattering."

Felix didn't smile. This was notable. Felix's smile was his primary tool, deployed with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel -- to disarm, to include, to create the warm illusion that you were the most important person in the room. The absence of the smile meant something, though Connor was not equipped to read what.

"You've been reliable, Connor. Four jobs, no problems. No questions." He paused on the word *questions* the way you'd pause on a speed bump -- acknowledging it existed without slowing down. "I appreciate that. Most people I work with ask too many questions, or they get nervous, or they talk. You don't talk."

"I'm an easy-going bloke."

"You are. And that's valuable." Felix pulled a chair around to face Connor and sat in it the way Europeans sat -- upright, knees apart, elbows on thighs, the posture of a man conducting an interview he'd already decided the outcome of. "The deliveries you've been doing -- the envelopes, the packages -- those are small. Entry-level. Think of them as... the probation period."

"Probation." Connor repeated the word and felt something move in his stomach -- not alarm, exactly, but the distant cousin of alarm, the first faint signal from a warning system he'd spent twenty-seven years learning to ignore. The word *probation* implied a structure, and structures implied organisations, and organisations implied something larger than two mates helping each other out.

"Let me explain," Felix said. "I work with an import-export company. Based in Hong Kong. We handle logistics for various products moving through Southeast Asia. Electronics, phone components, specialty goods. The company has partners in KL, Penang, Singapore, Bangkok. The envelopes and packages you've been carrying -- those are samples, invoices, small shipments. Routine stuff."

He spoke with the calm, measured cadence of a man reading from a script he'd polished through repetition, each word tested for weight and placed with care. The German accent softened the edges. The early-morning light softened everything else.

"But the business is growing. More product, more routes, more volume. I need someone here -- in KL, at this hostel, who can handle regular pickups and drop-offs. Not one-offs. A schedule. Three, maybe four times a week. Bigger items sometimes -- not envelopes. Backpacks. Suitcases. You'd be the KL leg of a chain that runs from here to Penang, sometimes to Singapore."

Connor drank his beer. The Tiger was cold and thin and tasted like every other Tiger he'd drunk in Southeast Asia, which was to say it tasted like being somewhere that wasn't home. He was aware of a sensation he did not immediately recognise, because it was not a sensation he often experienced. The sensation was hesitation.

"Backpacks?" he said.

"Backpacks. Sometimes boxes. Nothing that would look unusual -- you're a backpacker carrying a backpack, or a tourist with luggage. The items go from a pickup point to a drop-off point. Same as before, just more frequent and higher volume."

"And the money?"

Felix reached into the pocket of his linen shorts and produced his phone. He opened a banking app -- European, the interface in German -- and turned the screen toward Connor. The balance was visible for approximately two seconds, long enough for Connor to register the number and feel his pupils dilate.

"That's what three months of this work looks like," Felix said. "For me, at my level. You'd start lower, obviously. But RM2,000 a week is realistic. More, once you're established."

RM2,000 a week. Connor's parents sent him $2,000 Australian per month -- roughly RM6,000. Felix was offering him the same amount in three weeks, for work that took a few hours a day. The arithmetic was immediate and intoxicating, the way all arithmetic is when it tells you what you want to hear.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Instagram notification. He ignored it.

"That's..." Connor started, and the word he wanted was *insane* but the word that came out was "serious money."

"It is serious money. Because it's serious work. Not dangerous," Felix added, reading the thought before it formed, "but serious. Regular. Professional. You'd need to be punctual, discreet, and reliable. No telling people what you're doing -- not Jake, not Priya, not the hostel staff. This stays between us."

The hesitation was still there, a small stone in the mechanism of Connor's confidence. He could feel it catching on something, producing a sound he'd never heard before: doubt. Not the intellectual doubt of someone weighing evidence -- Connor didn't weigh evidence, he surfed over it -- but the bodily doubt of an animal that senses a change in the air before the storm arrives. His stomach was doing something it didn't usually do. His palms were damp, which he attributed to the humidity.

"Felix," he said. "Mate. Level with me."

Felix waited. His eyes were steady, the colour of creek water, and they held Connor's gaze with the patience of someone who had played this scene before and knew every possible line the other actor might deliver.

"This is all legit, yeah? Import-export. Phone stuff. Because I'm not--" He laughed, the defensive laugh, the laugh that precedes a sentence the speaker doesn't want to finish. "I mean, I'm not carrying drugs or anything. That's not--"

"Connor." Felix's voice was gentle, almost parental -- the tone of a father explaining to a child that the noise in the night is just the wind. "I'm a photographer. I do logistics work to fund my travels, the same way you do social media consulting. If I were involved in anything illegal, do you think I'd be living in a hostel in Chinatown? I'd be in a penthouse in KLCC."

The logic was so clean it gleamed. Connor picked it up and turned it over and found no scratches.

"Besides," Felix said, leaning back, letting the tension drain from his posture with the deliberate ease of a man releasing a hooked fish back into the water, "this is Malaysia. You've seen the signs at the airport. You know what happens to people who deal drugs here. You think I'd risk that? You think I'd put *you* at risk?"

The sign at the airport. Connor had walked past it on Day 1 -- red text, white background, the Malay crest. DADAH MEMBAWA MAUT. He hadn't read it. He hadn't read it but he'd seen it, and the seeing was enough for Felix to reference, enough to create the impression that Connor was informed, that Connor had considered the risks and judged them acceptable, that Connor was making an educated decision.

He wasn't. He was making the decision the way he'd made every decision since leaving Monash University: by following the path that felt good and assuming the universe would handle the rest.

"Yeah, no, of course," Connor said. "Sorry, mate. Didn't mean to--"

"No need to apologise." Felix smiled. The smile was back, warm and generous, and its return was like sunlight breaking through clouds -- a relief so palpable that Connor felt grateful, actually grateful, that Felix wasn't offended by the question. This was the mechanism at work: the brief withdrawal of warmth created a vacuum, and the vacuum created need, and the need made the return of warmth feel like a gift rather than a manipulation. It was textbook. Felix had learned it from a man in Bangkok who'd learned it from a woman in Guangzhou who'd learned it from whoever first discovered that love, strategically withheld, becomes a tool.

"Take today to think about it," Felix said. "No pressure. If you want to keep doing the small stuff, that's fine. But this is a proper opportunity, Connor. The kind of money that means you don't have to go home. The kind of money that means you stay."

He stood. Collected both beer bottles -- his half-finished, Connor's nearly empty. Walked to the rooftop door. At the threshold, he turned.

"RM2,000 a week, Connor. How long would that keep you here?"

The door closed. Felix's footsteps descended the staircase -- quiet, measured, the third step not squeaking because Felix had learned, as all predators learn, the exact geography of the terrain they hunted.

---

Connor sat on the rooftop for an hour.

The sun climbed. The dishwater sky brightened to white, then to the flat, merciless blue that KL produced on clear mornings, the blue that promised heat and delivered on the promise by nine. The Petronas Towers caught the light and became mirrors, throwing silver across the skyline. Below, the city was fully awake now: the motorcycle chorus, the vendor calls, the steady percussion of construction somewhere behind the hostel where a new condo was going up, crane visible above the shophouse rooftops like a mechanical bird feeding on concrete.

He thought about money.

This was what Connor did when the world presented him with a decision that had moral dimensions: he converted it into a financial problem, because financial problems had clean solutions and moral problems did not. The question was not *should I do this* but *can I afford not to*.

The arithmetic: RM2,000 a week was RM8,000 a month. His current expenses -- hostel (RM70/night, negotiated to RM50 for long-stay), food (RM40/day average), beer (RM30/day average), Grab rides (RM20/day), miscellaneous (RM200/week) -- totalled roughly RM5,500 a month. That left RM2,500 surplus. Per month. For the first time in his adult life, Connor would be saving money. Not the theoretical saving of someone who says "I should save" while spending -- the actual, mathematical saving of income exceeding expenditure.

He could stay in KL for six months. A year. He could get a proper apartment, leave the hostel, live like a local. He could stop asking his parents for money. He could stop the monthly deposit that came with the invisible weight of his mother's worry and his father's disappointment and his sister's silent judgement. He could be, for the first time, genuinely self-sufficient.

He could be what his Instagram said he was.

The thought was narcotic. It entered his bloodstream through the eyes -- the vision of himself as the man he performed -- and it moved through him with the warm, spreading ease of something designed to feel good and engineered to destroy.

He pulled out his phone. Opened Instagram. His last post -- the rooftop selfie from three days ago, Petronas Towers behind him, caption: *Office for the day. Your 9-5 could never.* -- had 52 likes. He scrolled through his feed: other nomads in Bali, Lisbon, Chiang Mai, Medellín. They all looked the same. They all claimed the same freedom. But Connor knew -- he knew with the certainty of a man who checks his bank balance at 2 AM -- that most of them were funded by parents, or credit cards, or the slow erosion of savings that would eventually pull them home.

He could be different. He could be the one who actually made it work.

The hesitation was still there, somewhere, a pebble in his shoe. He shifted his weight and it moved, and then it was in a different place, still there but differently uncomfortable, and he decided it was the chair and not the pebble and stood up and went downstairs.

---

The communal kitchen at half past seven was Mama Siti's kingdom.

She stood at the stove -- an ancient two-burner that should have been condemned during the Mahathir administration -- stirring a pot of curry with a wooden spoon the length of her forearm. The spoon was dark with decades of turmeric staining, smooth with use, and Mama Siti wielded it with an authority that suggested the spoon had opinions and she was the only person who could translate them.

She wore her uniform: a cotton baju kurung in faded blue, a white headscarf pinned with pragmatic indifference, and the expression she always wore, which was the expression of a woman who had been watching people eat her food for longer than most of them had been alive and had formed conclusions about the human race that she kept to herself.

Connor entered. Sat at the counter. The nasi lemak appeared.

"Selamat pagi, Mama."

She didn't respond. She'd stopped responding to Connor's attempts at Malay on day four, when he'd asked for "nasi goreng pedas" and pronounced it in a way that somehow sounded like a request for her grandmother's undergarments. She simply placed the banana leaf in front of him -- rice, sambal, egg, anchovies, peanuts, a slice of cucumber -- and returned to her pot.

Connor ate with his fingers. He'd become good at this -- the technique of compacting the rice with the fingertips, adding sambal, scooping to the mouth. The first time he'd tried, he'd gotten rice on his chin, his shirt, the counter, and an adjacent backpacker. Now he ate with something approaching grace, and the eating was a small ritual that connected him to the building, to the kitchen, to the morning, in a way that his Instagram posts about "authentic cultural immersion" never quite captured because the posts were about the image and the eating was about the thing itself.

"Mama," he said, between bites. "You ever think about money?"

She looked at him. The wooden spoon paused mid-stir.

"Money?" she said, as though the word was a variety of insect that had landed on her counter.

"Like, what would you do if someone offered you really good money for easy work? Would you take it?"

Mama Siti stirred. The curry bubbled. From the pot rose the smell of coconut milk and lemongrass and galangal, and beneath it, the deeper, darker smell of spice paste that had been ground by hand on a batu lesung that Mama Siti kept under the counter like a weapon.

"*Siapa makan cabai, dialah rasa pedas,*" she said.

Connor waited. Mama Siti did not translate. She never translated. The proverbs arrived in Malay and stayed in Malay, and if you wanted to understand them you could learn the language, and if you didn't want to learn the language, the proverbs would wait. They'd been waiting for centuries.

"Right," Connor said. "Cheers, Mama."

He finished his nasi lemak. Left a ten-ringgit note on the counter -- double the usual, because the extra money from Felix's deliveries had already changed the way he spent. The ten vanished. Mama Siti did not acknowledge the tip. She stirred her pot and spoke to it quietly in Malay, and the pot listened, which was more than the boy had done.

The proverb she'd spoken -- *Siapa makan cabai, dialah rasa pedas* -- meant: *He who eats the chilli is the one who feels the heat.*

Connor would never look it up.

---

He found Priya in the common room at nine, cross-legged in the armchair, her Lonely Planet open on her lap. She was wearing a white cotton T-shirt and denim shorts and her round glasses, and her hair was braided over one shoulder, and she was reading with the focused absorption of someone who believed that understanding the place you were in was not optional.

"Morning, babe."

She looked up. Smiled. Not the full smile -- the careful one, the one that had been recalibrated since their argument about the packages two days ago. The crack between them had been painted over but not repaired, and both of them could feel the paint.

"You were up early," she said. "I heard the door."

"Felix wanted to chat. Business stuff."

The word *business* crossed the space between them and landed at Priya's feet like something she hadn't ordered. She looked at it. She looked at Connor. She adjusted her glasses.

"What kind of business stuff?"

"Just the import-export thing. He wants me to do more regular work. Better pay."

"More deliveries."

"Regular deliveries. A proper schedule. Like a job."

Priya closed the Lonely Planet. The rubber bands snapped softly against the cover. She placed both hands flat on the book and looked at Connor with the expression he'd learned to recognise as her diagnostic face -- the face she wore when a patient presented symptoms they were trying to hide.

"Connor, can I tell you something without you getting defensive?"

"I'm never defensive."

"You're always defensive."

"That's a bit defensive of you to say."

She didn't laugh. This was bad. Priya's failure to laugh at his deflections was the barometric pressure drop before a storm.

"The more you work for Felix, the more you depend on Felix. The more you depend on Felix, the harder it is to stop. Do you see that? It's a pattern. It's -- in medicine, we'd call it a dependency loop. The treatment creates the condition that requires more treatment."

"Right, so Felix is a disease. Great. That's a really supportive thing to say about my mate."

"He's not your mate, Connor. He's your employer. And you don't know what he's employing you to do."

The sentence was precise and cold and it hit the wall of Connor's defences and left a small crack -- smaller than the one between them, but there. He felt it. For one suspended moment, the arithmetic dissolved and the question beneath it surfaced: *What am I carrying?*

He met her eyes. She was looking at him the way she looked at everything -- carefully, completely, with the full weight of her attention -- and he understood that she was not arguing with him. She was trying to save him. The realisation was uncomfortable because it implied he needed saving, and Connor Briggs did not need saving. Connor Briggs was fine. Connor Briggs had been travelling for four years and had never once needed saving.

"I know what I'm doing," he said.

She held his gaze for three full seconds -- counting, he could almost see her counting, the way doctors count before delivering results -- and then she looked down at the Lonely Planet and opened it and said, "Okay."

Not agreement. Not acceptance. Just the sound of a hand withdrawing.

Connor stood. "I'm going to Grind Culture. Coming?"

"No. I want to visit the Islamic Arts Museum. I've been meaning to go all week."

"Cool. Have fun."

He walked to the door. At the threshold, he stopped. Turned. She was reading -- or performing reading, her eyes moving across the page at a speed that suggested comprehension but her posture rigid, angled toward the door, listening to his footsteps fade.

"Priya."

She looked up.

"It's just logistics. Moving things from A to B. That's all it is."

She pushed her glasses up. "Okay, Connor."

He left. The word *okay* followed him down the staircase and out the front door and into the morning heat of Petaling Street, where the sun hit the pavement like a physical force and the air smelled of fried dough and diesel and the beginning of something that could not be undone.

---

Grind Culture was the café where Connor went to be a digital nomad.

It was on a side street off Jalan Sultan, a narrow shophouse that had been converted with the usual formula: exposed brick, Edison bulbs, a chalkboard menu with pour-over options no one ordered, a barista with a man-bun and an expression of cultivated boredom. The Wi-Fi was fast. The coffee was expensive. The clientele was a mixture of actual remote workers and people like Connor, who sat with laptops open and the appearance of productivity while doing exactly nothing.

He ordered his flat white -- RM14, which he no longer winced at -- and sat at his usual table by the window, the one that got good light for laptop selfies. He opened his MacBook. He opened a browser. He opened the Pacific Soul Retreats Instagram account, which he nominally managed, and spent seven minutes choosing between two nearly identical sunset photos for the Thursday post.

Then he opened a new tab and typed: *import export jobs kuala lumpur salary*

Google delivered. He scrolled through results: logistics coordinator, RM3,000-5,000/month. Supply chain analyst, RM4,000-7,000. Import clerk, RM2,500. The numbers confirmed what Felix had told him -- RM8,000 a month for courier work was high but not impossible, not insane, not the kind of figure that should trigger alarm bells. It was the upper end of logistics work. That was all.

He did not Google *drug trafficking penalties malaysia*.

He did not Google *backpacker drug mule southeast asia*.

He did not Google *signs you are being recruited as a drug courier*.

These searches would have taken seconds. They would have returned thousands of results -- news articles, embassy warnings, survivor testimonials, legal explainers, the Dangerous Drugs Act itself in full searchable text, with Section 39B highlighted in the red of a stop sign. The information was there, abundant, free, a wall of evidence standing between Connor and the decision he was about to make.

He did not look. He never looked. Looking was what careful people did, and careful people were the people who went home and got jobs and stopped travelling and became the people Connor pitied from the window of a café in a city they'd never visit.

He closed the tab. Opened Instagram. Posted the sunset photo for Pacific Soul. Caption: *Find your light.* Scheduled for 6 PM EST.

Then he texted Felix.

*I'm in. When do I start?*

The reply came in eleven seconds.

*Tomorrow. I'll set up the schedule tonight. Welcome aboard, Connor.*

A second message, two seconds later:

*This is going to change everything.*

Connor read it and smiled and felt the smile all the way down, through his chest and into his stomach where the hesitation had been sitting, and the smile was so wide and so warm that it buried the hesitation entirely, the way sunlight buries a shadow, the way noise buries a warning, the way the person you want to be buries the person you are.

He ordered a second flat white. He sat in the window of Grind Culture and watched Petaling Street move in its daily rhythm -- the tourists, the vendors, the old man with the bird cages, the motorcycle couriers threading between cars -- and he thought about RM2,000 a week and what it would feel like to not need his parents' money and what it would feel like to be free.

He did not think about what he would carry or where it came from or where it went or why it needed to move by hand through the streets of a city that killed people for moving certain things.

The flat white was good. The Wi-Fi was strong. The sun came through the window and made his laptop screen glow and he felt, with a certainty that had no evidence beneath it, that he had made the right decision.

---

Felix's schedule arrived at eleven PM, delivered in person.

Connor was in Bed 7, scrolling his phone, the blue light of the screen the only illumination in the dorm besides the ambient glow from the air well. The French backpacker above him was asleep, breathing with the congested regularity of a man whose sinuses had not adjusted to the tropics. Two beds down, a Korean girl was listening to something through earbuds, her face green-lit by her phone. The ceiling fan turned. The hostel breathed.

Three raps on the dorm door. Soft. The particular softness of a knock designed to wake one person without disturbing others.

Connor padded to the door in his board shorts. Felix was in the hallway, leaning against the wall with the easy posture of someone who had been waiting and didn't mind waiting, the way cats don't mind waiting because the waiting is part of the hunt.

"Walk with me," Felix said.

They went to the air well. The internal courtyard was small -- four metres square, open to the sky, the walls rising around it like a well shaft. During the day, light fell straight down and lit the mosaic tile bench and the potted plants and the small patch of ground where nothing grew because nothing had grown there since the building was built. At night, the air well was a column of dark air connecting the hostel's floors, and if you stood at the bottom and looked up, you could see a rectangle of sky framed by the building's walls, and sometimes stars, and sometimes the running lights of a plane descending toward KLIA.

No stars tonight. Just the orange ambient light of the city reflected off low cloud, and the hum, and the smell -- the hostel's nighttime smell of damp wood and mosquito coil and the ghost of Mama Siti's evening curry.

Felix produced a folded piece of paper from his shirt pocket. White, A4, creased into thirds. He unfolded it and held it so the glow from the second-floor hallway light fell across the surface. Connor leaned in.

It was a table. Handwritten, in Felix's precise European script. Days of the week across the top. Rows beneath: times, addresses, contact names.

Monday -- 10:00 -- Jalan Ipoh 47, Mr. Tan
Tuesday -- 14:00 -- Brickfields, Lorong 3, "Blue Door"
Wednesday -- REST
Thursday -- 11:00 -- Chow Kit, Jalan Raja Bot 12, Auntie Lim
Friday -- 10:00 -- Jalan Ipoh 47, Mr. Tan (return)
Saturday -- 16:00 -- Bukit Bintang, Lot 22B, ground floor, ask for Danny
Sunday -- REST

"Six drops a week, two rest days," Felix said. "You pick up from me or from Wei's shop, depending on the day. I'll text you each morning with the specifics. The items vary -- sometimes a package, sometimes an envelope, sometimes a backpack. You don't open them. You don't discuss them. You deliver, you collect confirmation -- usually a handshake or a nod -- and you leave."

Connor studied the schedule. The locations were spread across KL -- Jalan Ipoh to the north, Brickfields to the south, Chow Kit to the northeast, Bukit Bintang central. A geography of drops that covered the city like a net. Each location was a place he'd been to or passed through, ordinary streets in ordinary neighborhoods, the kind of places where a backpacker with a daypack would be invisible.

"Pay is weekly," Felix continued. "RM2,000, transferred to your account every Sunday night. If a job gets cancelled -- rain, schedule change, whatever -- you still get the base rate. Think of it as a salary."

A salary. The word landed like a key in a lock, the tumbler turning, the door opening onto a room Connor had wanted to enter since the day he dropped out of university. A salary meant legitimacy. A salary meant he was working, earning, contributing. A salary meant the next time his mother asked "What are you doing over there, Connor?" he would have an answer that didn't require creative editing.

"What about the items?" Connor asked. The question surprised him -- it emerged from the space where the hesitation had been, a small survivor clinging to a piece of wreckage. "Like, if someone asks me what I'm carrying--"

"Nobody asks. You're a tourist with a bag. But if someone asks, you're carrying gifts for a friend. Or supplies for a business. Or your own things. Nobody looks twice at a backpacker."

"Right."

"One more thing." Felix's voice changed register -- not louder, not harder, but more focused, the way a spotlight narrows. "This stays between us. Completely. Not Priya, not Jake, not the hostel staff. Nobody. The people I work with value discretion above everything else. If word gets out that I'm running a logistics operation from this hostel, the landlord shuts it down. Razak shuts it down. Immigration gets involved. It's bad for everyone."

"Yeah, no. Of course. I'm not going to--"

"I know you won't." Felix folded the paper and handed it to Connor. "Keep this somewhere safe. Don't photograph it. Don't put it in your phone."

Connor took the paper. It was warm from Felix's pocket, the folds sharp and deliberate. He held it the way you hold a ticket -- a ticket to somewhere better, somewhere the bank balance didn't fall and the parents' deposit wasn't needed and the Instagram posts weren't lies.

"Starting tomorrow," Felix said. "Monday. Jalan Ipoh. I'll have the package ready by nine. Meet me in my room."

"Done."

They stood in the air well. Above them, the rectangle of sky was orange and starless and alive with the reflected glow of eight million people going about the business of a city that did not know or care that a twenty-seven-year-old Australian had just agreed to carry things he'd never opened for people he'd never met to places he'd never questioned, on a schedule written by a man whose real name might not be Felix Decker.

"One more thing," Felix said.

He reached into his pocket and produced a phone. Not his phone -- a different one. Small, cheap, a Samsung with a cracked case and a prepaid SIM. He handed it to Connor.

"Work phone. I'll text you on this. Keep it charged, keep it on you. Don't use it for anything personal. No Instagram, no calls to Mum. This is for business only."

Connor held the phone. It was light in his hand, anonymous, the kind of phone that was sold in plastic blister packs at 7-Eleven for RM80. A burner. The word appeared in his mind, surfacing from the reservoir of crime dramas and true-crime podcasts he'd consumed over the years. A burner phone.

The hesitation made one last attempt. It rose from wherever it had been pressed, broke through the surface of his thoughts, and formed a sentence: *Legitimate businesses don't give you burner phones.*

He looked at the phone. He looked at Felix. Felix was watching him with the same expression he always wore when Connor was on the edge of a question -- patient, calm, faintly amused, as if watching a child puzzle over something simple.

"Standard practice," Felix said. "The company uses prepaid phones for all field staff. It's a liability thing. Corporate policy."

The sentence was absurd. The sentence was so transparently, obviously absurd that any person paying the slightest attention would have laughed. Corporate policy. For a logistics company that operated out of a Chinatown hostel and a phone repair shop and paid cash. Corporate policy.

Connor put the phone in his pocket.

"Cool," he said. "Makes sense."

And that was the moment. Not the moment when he'd agreed, not the moment when he'd texted *I'm in*, not the moment when he'd looked at the schedule and felt the key turn in the lock. This was the moment. The pocket. The phone. The weight of it against his thigh, small and warm and cheap, the weight of a second life he was choosing to carry without examining, the way he'd carried every package without examining, the way he'd carried Felix's friendship without examining, the way he'd carried himself through the world for twenty-seven years without examining any of it.

The phone was in his pocket and the paper was in his hand and Felix was smiling and the air well was dark and somewhere above them, in the rectangle of sky, a plane was descending toward KLIA, its lights blinking, carrying someone new to the city -- a new arrival, a new guest, a new body to fill a bed in a hostel that had been filling beds and emptying them for nearly a century.

"Get some sleep," Felix said. "Big day tomorrow."

He turned and climbed the staircase. Second floor, third floor, the third step not squeaking. His door closed. The corridor was silent.

Connor stood in the air well alone. The mosaic tiles were cold under his bare feet. The sulfurous breath of the building's drains rose from somewhere below, mixing with the faint smell of Mama Siti's curry from the kitchen, left to cool in a pot on the stove, spiced and ancient and indifferent. He looked up. The orange sky looked back. From somewhere on the second floor, the Korean girl's music -- a high, sweet voice singing in a language he didn't understand about something he would never know.

He went back to Bed 7. He folded the schedule and tucked it into the inner pocket of his daypack, the zippered compartment where he kept his passport and emergency cash and the blue Sea to Summit towel that had been with him through twelve countries and would be with him at the end.

He placed the burner phone on the mattress beside his regular phone. Two screens. Two lives. The old phone -- cracked, sticker-covered, 4,200 followers, his mother's contact, his sister's silence, the Pacific Soul Retreats account, the Instagram grid of a life performed. The new phone -- clean, anonymous, no contacts except one, no history, no followers, no identity. A blank screen waiting to be filled with work he would not question, for money he would not trace, from a man he would not doubt.

He lay in the dark and listened to the building settle -- the wood expanding and contracting with the temperature, the pipes groaning, the ceiling fan's metronomic *tick, tick, tick*. Somewhere below, a door opened and closed. Somewhere above, Felix's floorboards creaked as he paced his private room, doing whatever Felix did at midnight, which Connor had never wondered about and wasn't going to start wondering about now.

*RM2,000 a week,* he thought. *She'll be right.*

He fell asleep with both phones on the mattress beside him, one in each hand, the digital nomad and the courier, the person he showed the world and the person he was becoming, both warm, both humming faintly with the electromagnetic life of their circuits, both connected to networks that stretched across the city and beyond, one visible and one invisible, one counting likes and one counting something else entirely.

In the morning, the call to prayer would come at 5:32, and Connor would not hear it, and the city would ask its question -- *are you awake, are you listening, do you know where you are* -- and Connor would not answer, because Connor was not listening, and he did not know where he was, and the knowing, by now, was already too late to help.

But morning was hours away. Now there was only the dark, and the fan, and the two phones, and the building breathing around him like something patient and very old, and the name on the bed frame -- L-E-N-A -- five letters carved into wood by a girl who had slept in this exact spot and carried packages for this exact man and was now in a place where the fluorescent lights never turned off and the doors did not open from the inside.

Connor slept. The building didn't.
# Chapter 12: Don't Ask

Monday morning arrived with the smell of rain on hot concrete and the sound of Mei Ling arguing with a Grab driver on the street below.

Connor heard it through the air well -- the rapid-fire Cantonese that Mei Ling deployed in situations that required a precision weapon rather than the polite English she used at reception. The driver was arguing back. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that sounded like a negotiation conducted at swordpoint, each syllable a thrust, each pause a recalibration. It ended the way Mei Ling's arguments always ended: with the sound of a car door closing, an engine starting, and silence. The silence of victory.

Connor reached for the phone on his mattress. Not the old phone. The new one -- the Samsung, the burner, the work phone, which he was already thinking of with the casual familiarity of a tool you've owned for years rather than hours. The screen showed one message, received at 7:14 AM:

*Package ready. Room 301. Come when you're dressed.*

He swung his legs off Bed 7. The morning routine -- board shorts, singlet (today: LIFE'S A BEACH in fading letters), flip-flops, leather bracelet. He splashed water on his face in the second-floor bathroom. The mirror above the sink was spotted with age and humidity, the silvering gone dark at the edges, and the face that looked back at him was the face he always saw: tanned, stubbled, squinting. The face of a man who had figured things out.

He climbed to the third floor. Felix's door was closed. Connor knocked twice -- a pattern that was already becoming habit, the specific two-knock rhythm that meant *it's me*, that meant *I'm ready*, that meant *I'm the one who doesn't ask questions*.

The door opened. Felix was dressed, groomed, the private room behind him neat and intentional in the way Felix's world was always neat and intentional. The bed made with hospital corners. A laptop open on the desk, displaying something Felix minimised before Connor could see it. The window overlooking Petaling Street, shuttered against the morning light, the wooden slats throwing striped shadows across the floor.

On the desk, beside the closed laptop, a package.

This one was different.

The previous packages had been small -- shoebox-sized, wrapped in brown paper, light enough to carry in one hand. This was larger. A sports bag -- black nylon, generic, the kind sold at every market stall in Southeast Asia for thirty ringgit. Zippered shut. Not sealed with tape the way the brown paper packages had been, just zipped, the two halves of the zipper meeting in the middle with a casualness that was either confident or careless.

Connor looked at the bag. The bag looked like a bag.

"Jalan Ipoh," Felix said. "Mr. Tan. Same as the schedule. The address is in your work phone -- I texted it last night."

"Got it."

Connor reached for the bag. Lifted it. And paused.

It was heavier than the packages. Not dramatically heavier -- not the weight of bricks or metal -- but heavier than phone chargers. Heavier than cables. He felt the weight settle into his arm, into his shoulder, and the weight had a texture to it, a density that suggested whatever was inside was packed tightly, compressed, occupying less space than its mass suggested it should.

"What's in this one?" The words came out before the machine could stop them, emerging from the same place the hesitation had lived -- the shrinking territory of Connor's self-preservation, the last patch of ground where doubt still grew.

Felix looked at him. The look lasted one second. In that second, something moved behind Felix's eyes -- a calculation, a recalibration, the quick assessment of a man who manages risk for a living and has just detected a variable. Then the look was gone and Felix was Felix again, warm and easy and unconcerned.

"Phone components. The same as always. Just a bigger order." He gestured at the bag. "Mr. Tan's shop is expanding. He needs more stock."

"Right. Yeah. Course." Connor hoisted the bag onto his shoulder. The weight distributed. It became ordinary. He was a backpacker with a bag, and in this city, in this neighbourhood, that was the most invisible thing you could be.

"Connor."

He turned at the door. Felix was standing by the desk, one hand on the closed laptop, and his expression was the one he wore when he was about to say something he wanted Connor to remember.

"Don't open the bag."

"I wasn't going to--"

"The clients are particular about packaging. If the seal is broken -- even if you rezip it -- they'll know, and they won't accept the delivery. It's a quality control thing. The components are packed in a specific configuration. If you disturb it, the whole shipment has to be redone."

"Mate, I wasn't going to open it."

"I know you weren't. I'm just telling you."

The words were reasonable. The tone was reasonable. Everything about the exchange was so perfectly reasonable that it should have been unremarkable, a boss telling an employee to follow procedure, nothing more. But there was something in the instruction -- the specificity of it, the pre-emptive quality, the way Felix had answered a question Connor hadn't asked -- that lingered. Like a taste you can't identify. Like a sound in an empty room.

"Have a good run," Felix said, and smiled, and the smile closed the conversation the way a lid closes a box.

---

The Grab from Petaling Street to Jalan Ipoh took twenty-two minutes.

Connor sat in the back seat with the black sports bag on his lap. The driver -- a young Malay man with a skull-cap and a dashboard Quran -- drove in silence, the radio tuned to a station playing dangdut, the Indonesian pop genre that sounded like someone had put a love song and a drum machine in a blender and poured the result directly into Connor's neural pathways. The music was hypnotic, repetitive, the kind of sound that fills a car the way water fills a glass -- completely, leaving no room for thought.

Which was useful, because thought was the enemy this morning.

The bag sat on his lap. His hands rested on the nylon. Through the fabric, he could feel the shape of the contents -- not individual items but a mass, a single compressed form, wrapped in something, packed tight. The shape was rectangular, approximately the size of a laptop, but heavier. Denser. His fingers found the edge of the zipper -- the small metal tab, warm from the car's interior, resting against the nylon like a door handle.

He could open it. Right now, in the back of this Grab, with the driver absorbed in dangdut and the traffic crawling past the Chow Kit market. He could unzip the bag six inches, look inside, see the phone components or the chargers or whatever was in there, confirm the story, and zip it back up. Felix would never know. Mr. Tan would never know. The zip would realign. The "quality control configuration" would be undisturbed.

His thumb found the zipper tab. Pressed against the metal. Felt the tiny ridge of teeth beneath.

The car stopped at a traffic light. Outside the window, a billboard rose above the shophouses: POLIS DIRAJA MALAYSIA -- the Royal Malaysia Police crest, blue and gold, above a public safety message in Malay and English. The English text read: KEEPING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE. Below the crest, in smaller text: REPORT DRUG ACTIVITY -- 999.

Connor looked at the billboard. The billboard looked back. The light changed. The car moved. The billboard slid away.

His thumb was still on the zipper. He could feel his own pulse through the pad of his thumb, the blood fast and hard, the body already deciding what the mind refused to. Open the bag. See what's inside. Know the truth.

*And then what?*

The question arrived with the force of practical reality. If he opened the bag and found phone components, he'd feel stupid for doubting Felix. If he opened the bag and found something else -- something that was not phone components, something that the billboards warned about, something that the airport signs promised death for carrying -- then he would know. And knowing would require action. Knowing would require a decision: continue, or stop. And stopping meant losing the RM2,000 a week. Stopping meant losing Felix. Stopping meant going back to RM14 flat whites and his parents' deposit and the slow, grinding arithmetic of a life that didn't add up.

Not knowing was easier. Not knowing was free.

His thumb moved away from the zipper. The bag sat on his lap, unopened, and the not-knowing settled over him like a blanket -- warm, comforting, the comfort of a man who preferred the dark room he was sitting in to the light that would show him what was in it.

The Grab pulled up outside a shophouse on Jalan Ipoh. Connor got out. The heat hit him like a wall of wet wool. He slung the bag over his shoulder, walked to the metal roller door that was half-raised, ducked under, and found Mr. Tan.

Mr. Tan was approximately fifty, thin, with the compressed energy of a man who had been doing this for decades and had reduced the process to its most efficient form. He took the bag. Unzipped it -- Connor watched, trying to see inside, but Mr. Tan's body blocked the view -- inspected the contents for approximately three seconds, rezipped, nodded once.

No handshake. No conversation. The roller door descended.

Connor's work phone buzzed: RM350 transferred.

He walked back to the main road in the sun. The delivery had taken four minutes. Three hundred and fifty ringgit for four minutes of walking. The mathematics of it was so absurd that it functioned as its own anaesthetic: anything that paid this well had to be legitimate, because the alternative -- that it paid this well because it was dangerous, because the risk premium was built into the rate, because the money was compensation for the probability of catastrophic consequences -- was a thought Connor did not have the architecture to construct.

He flagged a Grab. Went home.

---

The Lantern Hostel at midday was in its somnolent phase -- the quiet hours between check-out and the afternoon rush, when the building drifted in a warm stupor of ceiling fans and empty corridors. The common room TV was playing a Malay cooking show to nobody. The bookshelf had acquired a new addition: *Shantaram*, dog-eared, its spine cracked at page 200, the exact point where every backpacker in Southeast Asia stopped reading *Shantaram*.

Connor came through the front door and turned right toward the staircase, his daypack over one shoulder, the black sports bag no longer with him, the RM350 warming his account, the morning's delivery already migrating from *thing I did* to *thing that happened*, the active voice becoming passive, the agency dissolving.

"Connor."

He stopped. Mei Ling was behind the reception counter.

She was always behind the reception counter. The counter was her territory, the wooden surface scarred with seventeen years of key-drops and ledger-signings and the casual violence of backpackers leaning too hard on cheap wood. Mei Ling presided over it with the calm authority of someone who had seen every kind of guest pass through and had catalogued them all.

Today she was not doing what she usually did -- the quiet busywork of reception, the shuffling of papers, the checking of the ledger. She was standing. Arms at her sides. Looking at Connor with an expression he had never seen on her face before.

The expression was difficult. It contained several things at once, layered like the sediment in old rock: concern at the base, irritation above that, and at the surface, the particular exhaustion of someone who has watched a preventable disaster approach and has been unable to stop it.

"Can I speak with you?"

"Yeah, sure. What's up?"

She didn't answer immediately. She looked past him, at the front door, at the street beyond where the phone repair shop's fluorescent light was visible. Then she looked back.

"Come here. To the counter."

Connor approached. The reception counter was chest-high, the wood dark with age, a bell and a hand-sanitiser bottle and a laminated card of house rules the only objects on its surface. Behind Mei Ling, the wall of guest keys -- metal hooks, most empty at this hour. The hostel's guest ledger, thick and cloth-bound, sitting on a shelf beside a box of passports being held for current guests.

Mei Ling placed both hands flat on the counter. Her nails were short, unpainted, practical. Her polo shirt -- white, red lantern logo on the breast pocket -- was pressed. Everything about Mei Ling was pressed: her clothes, her expression, her patience, which she was pressing to its limit.

"I see you," she said. "Every morning. Going out with a bag that isn't yours. Coming back without it. Sometimes twice a day."

Connor's stomach performed a small, cold contraction. He smiled. The Instagram smile -- wide, warm, weaponised.

"That's my freelance gear, Mei. Laptop, chargers, camera stuff. I work from cafés."

"Your laptop is in your dorm. I saw it on your bunk this morning when Aisha was cleaning."

The smile held. Behind it, the machine was running -- the rationalisation engine, the defence system, the twenty-seven years of practised evasion that Connor deployed with the fluency of a native speaker. "Sometimes I don't bring the laptop. Sometimes it's just camera gear. I'm doing some photography work for a client--"

"Connor." Her voice cut through his sentence with the precision of someone who had spent two years learning when guests were lying, which was most of the time, and had decided that today she was not going to let the lie land. "Please be careful what you carry for other people."

The sentence arrived in the space between them and stayed there. It did not move. It did not qualify itself. It sat on the reception counter like a stone, and Mei Ling looked at Connor with the expression of a woman who had just placed her last card on the table and was waiting to see if the man across from her was capable of reading it.

Connor heard the words. The words were clear. The words were, in fact, so clear that they required no interpretation, no context, no additional information. *Be careful what you carry for other people.* It was not a riddle. It was not a proverb. It was not Mama Siti's Malay wisdom, opaque and beautiful and ignorable. It was a direct, English-language warning from a young woman who was looking at him with something very close to fear.

He heard it. He processed it. And then the machine ran.

*She's just doing her job. It's a liability thing. The hostel has a policy about guests' belongings. She's covering herself. She doesn't know anything -- she's making assumptions because she's seen me carrying bags. Everyone carries bags. I'm a backpacker. Bags are what we do.*

"Mei, I appreciate the concern. But I'm a big boy. I know what I'm doing."

She held his gaze for a long moment. Behind her round face and her practical ponytail and her pressed polo shirt, behind the reception counter and the guest ledger and the laminated house rules, something was happening -- a decision being made, a line being drawn, the quiet recalibration of a person who has extended a hand and felt it pushed away.

"The rules are posted," she said, her voice flat now, the concern drained away, replaced by the professional neutrality of an employee returning to protocol. She pointed at the laminated card on the counter. Connor's eyes followed her finger to the bottom of the list, where rule number 6 was printed in red:

**Guests are responsible for knowing and obeying Malaysian law. The hostel is not liable.**

"I've read them," Connor said. He hadn't.

"Good."

She sat down behind the counter. Opened the ledger. Began writing. The conversation was over. The warning had been issued, received, and dismissed, and Mei Ling had added Connor to the mental ledger she kept -- the one that wasn't cloth-bound, the one that tracked not room assignments and payment dates but the guests she expected never to see again.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters were visible under the peeling paint -- brush strokes from 1943, administrative notations from an occupation that had used this building for purposes the building still remembered. Connor walked past them the way he walked past everything: without looking, without reading, without knowing that the characters he passed every day said *processing room*, which in 1943 meant something no one in the building wanted to remember.

---

The afternoon unfolded in the way KL afternoons unfolded: slowly, hotly, with the gathering promise of rain.

Connor was in the common room, on the sofa, doing his impression of a man at work. His laptop was open. The Pacific Soul Retreats account was loaded. He was choosing between three stock photos of a yoga retreat in Ubud -- all identical, all featuring a woman in white doing a pose that looked like she was trying to reach something on a high shelf -- when the rain began.

It didn't start gradually. KL rain arrived like a decision -- one moment the sky was grey and swollen, the next the air was water, the zinc roofs of Petaling Street hammered with a sound like ten thousand drummers playing the same beat. Rain cascaded down the air well in sheets, turning the courtyard into a small waterfall. The gutters overflowed. The smell changed -- the hot concrete and diesel of a tropical afternoon replaced instantly by the green, electric smell of ozone and wet earth.

Connor closed his laptop and watched. The rain was extraordinary in the way KL rain was always extraordinary -- not the grey drizzle of Melbourne but a vertical ocean, a biblical demonstration of water's capacity for volume. It hit the pavement so hard it bounced, creating a secondary mist that rose from the ground and merged with the falling rain, so that for a few minutes the street was barely visible, a grey-white haze punctuated by the red taillights of stalled traffic.

The hostel filled. Travelers who had been out on afternoon excursions came streaming through the front door, laughing, drenched, wringing out hats and squeezing water from hair. The common room's population tripled in ten minutes. Conversations started the way conversations always started in hostels during rain: Where are you from? How long are you here? Have you been to...?

Connor was drawn into a group. Three Scandinavians -- two Swedish women and a Danish man -- who were sharing a bottle of duty-free vodka mixed with canned passion fruit juice, a combination that tasted like a tropical sunset designed by someone who had never seen one. The Swedish women were medical students on placement in Penang, down to KL for the weekend. The Danish man, Lars, was a software developer "on sabbatical," which appeared to mean "drinking in hostels until the money ran out."

They were loud. They were fun. They were the specific kind of fun that hostels manufactured -- the effortless, temporary, chemistry-of-strangers fun that happened when you put young people from different countries in a room with alcohol and rain.

Connor drank. He told his stories -- the Bali stories, the Cambodia stories, the time he'd ridden a motorcycle across Vietnam without a licence ("Mate, the cops just waved me through, it's different in Asia"). He was good at this. This was his skill, his actual skill: the transformation of unremarkable experiences into compelling narratives, the alchemy of turning a cheap holiday into an epic. He held the group. He made them laugh. He made the Swedish women lean in. He made Lars nod with the earnest agreement of a man three vodkas deep.

For an hour, he was the person he believed himself to be. The traveler. The storyteller. The one who had figured it out.

Then one of the Swedish women -- Astrid, blonde, tall, with the angular features of a Bergman film -- said something that detonated quietly in the middle of the conversation.

"We had a lecture before we came," she said. "At the university. On practicing medicine abroad. Part of the briefing was about local laws."

She was two vodkas in, her English precise and musical in the way Swedish-accented English was, every vowel clear. She was talking to the group generally but looking at Connor specifically, the way people looked at the person who talked the most.

"Did you know that Malaysia has the death penalty for drugs?" she said. "Like, actual death penalty. Not life in prison -- death. If you're caught with more than fifty grams of methamphetamine, you're automatically charged with trafficking. Mandatory death sentence."

The common room was warm. The rain hammered outside.

"Yeah, they've got signs at the airport," Connor said. "Mental, isn't it?"

"We had to sign a declaration before we came. That we understood the drug laws and wouldn't carry anything for anyone. Even prescriptions -- our professor said you can get into trouble for carrying painkillers without documentation."

Lars, the Danish man, nodded. "Same in Singapore. My friend's cousin -- this was ten years ago -- got caught at the Causeway with hash. He was in prison for two years. And that's light. In Malaysia, with the quantity they're talking about..."

He drew a finger across his throat. The gesture was theatrical, clumsy, the kind of thing a drunk man does when he thinks he's being dramatic. But the meaning was unambiguous.

"That's for dealers though, isn't it?" Connor said. "Like, actual drug dealers. Big fish. They're not going to execute some backpacker who's got a joint in his pocket."

"The law doesn't distinguish," Astrid said. She said it the way medical students said things -- with the flat certainty of someone quoting a textbook. "Over fifty grams, you're presumed to be trafficking. The burden of proof reverses. You have to prove you *weren't* trafficking. And the mandatory sentence is death."

"Mandatory meaning--"

"The judge has no choice. It's automatic. You're convicted, you're sentenced. There's an appeal process but the success rate is..." She shrugged. The shrug contained the entire weight of a legal system designed to be merciless.

"That's insane," Jake said. Jake had appeared from somewhere, beer in hand, attracted by the gravity of a group. "They can't just kill you for carrying drugs. Like, there have to be exceptions. For foreigners."

"There are no exceptions for foreigners," Astrid said. "They've executed Australians. Nigerians. Iranians. A British woman in the eighties, though I think that was in a different country. The point is, the law applies to everyone."

"They've executed Australians?" Connor's voice did something he didn't intend -- it rose half an octave, the register of surprise rather than the register of casual dismissal. He corrected immediately. "I mean, that's -- when was this? Ages ago, right?"

"I don't know the details. Our professor mentioned it. The point was clear: know the law before you go."

"Right. Well, I'm not carrying any drugs, so." He laughed. The laugh was supposed to close the topic the way a door closes a room -- firmly, completely, with the clear message that whatever was on the other side was not relevant to whoever was on this side. But the door didn't close all the way. A draught came through.

He drank his vodka-passion-fruit. It was warm now, the ice melted, the taste cloying. The rain was beginning to ease, the percussion on the zinc roof fading from fury to murmur. The common room was steamy, the air thick with the humidity of twenty wet bodies and the smell of cheap vodka and rainwater.

Connor's mind was doing something it rarely did: operating on two levels simultaneously. The surface level -- the talking, the laughing, the performing -- continued without interruption. Beneath it, a second process was running, involuntary and unwelcome, playing back Astrid's words in a loop.

*Mandatory death sentence. Over fifty grams. The law doesn't distinguish. No exceptions for foreigners.*

The sports bag he'd carried that morning. The weight of it. The density. The rectangular shape, compressed, heavier than phone chargers. How heavy was fifty grams? He didn't know. He'd never thought in grams. Fifty grams was... the weight of a few coins? The weight of a small chocolate bar? The weight of something that could fit in the palm of your hand?

*What was in the bag?*

The question surfaced, bright and sharp, like a fish breaking water. He looked at it. The machine started running.

*Phone components. Felix said phone components. Felix has never lied to me. The bag was full of phone components for Mr. Tan's shop, which is expanding. It was heavier because it was a bigger order. Simple. Logical. Done.*

The fish sank. The water closed. The surface was smooth again.

"Anyway," Connor said, refilling his cup from the vodka bottle, "who wants to hear about the time I accidentally crashed a wedding in Bali?"

The group laughed. The conversation moved on. The rain stopped. KL's sky cracked open and revealed the late-afternoon sun, which hit the wet streets and turned them to mirrors and made everything -- the shophouses, the temples, the market stalls, the Petronas Towers in the distance -- glow with the specific, temporary beauty that follows a tropical downpour, the beauty that makes you forget what came before and not think about what comes next.

---

That night, Connor lay in Bed 7 and could not sleep.

This was unusual. Connor's relationship with sleep was the same as his relationship with most things: uncomplicated, requiring no effort, arriving when expected. He typically fell asleep within minutes of closing his eyes, his consciousness dimming like a phone screen timing out, the day's inputs dissolving into the static of dreams that he never remembered.

Tonight the static wouldn't come.

The dorm was dark. The ceiling fan turned. The French backpacker above was asleep. Two beds over, the Korean girl's earbuds emitted a faint tinny pulse. Through the air well, the residual sounds of the city's midnight -- a motorcycle, a distant stereo, a cat in the alley -- filtered up through the building's open core and settled into the room like sediment.

Connor's mind was replaying the afternoon's conversation. Not all of it -- not the Bali wedding story or Lars's software sabbatical or the Swedish women's medical placements. Just one part. Just Astrid's voice, precise and Swedish-accented, saying: *The law doesn't distinguish.*

He turned over. The mattress squeaked. The thin foam compressed under his shoulder with the familiar inadequacy of hostel bedding. He stared at the wooden slats of the bunk above him, at the stickers -- BINTANG BEER, FULL MOON PARTY KOH PHANGAN, a Thai flag, a peace sign -- and tried to think about something else.

*RM2,000 a week. That's what matters. That's the reality. Not some hypothetical, paranoid, what-if scenario about drug laws that don't apply to me because I'm not carrying drugs.*

*Am I carrying drugs?*

The question came. It was not the first time it had come. But it was the first time it stayed.

He lay in the dark and held the question and looked at it the way you look at something you've found in a drawer that you don't recognise -- turning it over, trying to determine if it's valuable or dangerous or both. The question had weight. It had the same weight as the sports bag -- the weight of something compressed, dense, occupying less space than its mass should allow.

He thought about the bag. The black nylon. The zipper. The rectangular shape inside. The way Mr. Tan had unzipped it with his body blocking the view. The way Felix had said *don't open it* with the specific emphasis of a man who was not talking about quality control.

He thought about Mei Ling. *Be careful what you carry for other people.* The stone she'd placed on the counter between them, the stone he'd stepped over.

He thought about the burner phone on the mattress beside him. The work phone. The corporate-policy phone. The phone that legitimate import-export businesses definitely gave their field staff, because that was how the corporate world worked, obviously, everyone knew that.

He thought about Priya's face in the common room two days ago. *It looks like something I've read about.*

He thought about Tomoko's voice. *The people Felix knows are not who he says they are.*

He thought about Mama Siti's proverb. *He who eats the chilli feels the heat.*

He thought about Astrid's words. *Mandatory death sentence. No exceptions for foreigners.*

The thoughts circled. They moved through his mind the way the ceiling fan moved through the humid air -- around and around, never arriving anywhere, never resolving, just circulating. Each thought produced a counter-thought. Each doubt produced a defence. The machine ran. But tonight the machine was not running smoothly. Tonight there was grit in the gears, sand in the engine, the accumulated friction of too many warnings dismissed and too many questions unasked.

Connor lay in the dark and felt something he had not felt since the night before his Monash University exam results came back, the exam he knew he'd failed, the exam that would confirm what he'd been running from for the rest of his life: that he was not the person he'd told everyone he was.

The feeling was fear.

Not the clean, sharp fear of immediate danger -- not the fear of a snake or a cliff or a car coming too fast. This was the other fear, the slow one, the one that lives in the back of the skull and wakes you at three AM and asks questions you can't answer. The fear of having done something that cannot be undone. The fear of a mistake so large it doesn't have edges, so you can't see where it ends and where you begin.

He thought: *I should open the next bag.*

The thought was clear. It was responsible. It was the thought of a man engaging with reality for the first time in weeks, reaching out to touch the surface of the water he'd been floating on and checking whether it was water or something else.

He thought: *If it's phone components, then I'm right and everyone else is wrong and I'll keep going and the money will come and everything will be fine.*

He thought: *If it's not phone components--*

He stopped. The sentence had a second half but the second half contained a world he could not enter from the warm safety of Bed 7 in Dorm 3 in the Lantern Hostel on Petaling Street in Kuala Lumpur. The second half contained police and lawyers and embassies and phone calls to his mother at three AM Melbourne time and the sound of her voice breaking and the word *mandatory* and the word *death* and the word *sentence*, and these words were too large for this small dark room with the ceiling fan and the French snorer and the stickers of places where people had been happy.

He didn't finish the sentence. He turned over. He pulled the blue Sea to Summit towel from beneath his pillow -- he slept with it there, always, a habit from years of hostels where things went missing -- and draped it across his chest. The microfiber was cool and smooth and smelled faintly of sunscreen and the Andaman Sea and all the places the towel had been with him, all the countries and the showers and the beaches and the laundry sinks where he'd washed it by hand and wrung it out and hung it to dry and known, in the simple, animal certainty of possession, that this was his.

The fear was still there. But the towel was on his chest and the fan was turning and the building was breathing and somewhere in the machinery of his mind, the operator was reaching for the off switch.

*She'll be right,* Connor thought. *She's always been right. I'll open the next one. Just to check. Just to be sure. And it'll be phone components, because it's always been phone components, and then I'll know, and I'll stop worrying, and everything will be fine.*

He wouldn't open the next one. He knew this already, the way you know you won't go to the gym tomorrow even as you set the alarm. The promise to check was a sedative, not a plan. It existed to get him through the night, to bridge the gap between the fear and the morning, to give the machine time to reassemble itself and smooth the grit from its gears and resume the production of certainty that was Connor Briggs's primary manufacture.

Sleep came. It took longer than usual -- forty minutes, maybe fifty, the longest he'd been awake in a hostel bed since the cockroach incident in Phnom Penh -- but it came, descending through the layers of his consciousness and carrying him down to a place where the questions didn't follow.

He slept. The phones lay beside him -- one cracked and sticker-covered and full of the life he showed the world, one clean and anonymous and full of a life he carried in the dark. The blue towel rose and fell on his chest with his breathing.

Beneath his hand, unlit, unfelt, the name in the bed frame waited.

L-E-N-A.

She had laid in this exact position. She had held this exact fear. She had told herself the same lies, in the same dark, in the same bed, with the same fan turning overhead. And she had not opened the bag, and she had not asked the question, and the machine had run, and the morning had come, and she had carried the next one and the next one and the next one until the morning came when the bag didn't matter anymore because the police were at the bus station and the handcuffs were cold and the word *mandatory* was no longer theoretical.

Lena was in Kajang Prison, forty kilometres south of this bed. She had a number now instead of a name. She had a cell instead of a dorm. She had a sentence instead of a future. And the bed frame still carried her name, five letters carved with a fingernail or a coin, a message to whoever came next, a message that said *I was here, I was real, I carried the bags and I didn't ask and this is where it ends*, and the message went unread every night by the boy who slept above it, the boy who was following the same path, step by step, bag by bag, into the same dark.

The building creaked. The rain had passed. The city hummed. And in the morning, the work phone would buzz with a new address, and Connor would dress and descend and collect a new bag and carry it without opening it to a new man in a new doorway, and the money would arrive in his account, and the machine would run, and the fear would dissolve in the daylight the way it always dissolved, the way it was designed to dissolve, the way it would keep dissolving right up until the moment when the fear was the only thing left and even the machine couldn't make it go away.

But that was later. Now there was sleep, and the towel, and the dark, and the building holding him the way buildings hold everyone who sleeps inside them -- gently, temporarily, without promise.
# Chapter 13: The Other Traveler

The man's name was David, and he had a story Connor didn't want to hear.

It was a Thursday night, Day 19, and the bar on Changkat Bukit Bintang was called The Whiskey Kitchen, which was a lie twice over because it served mainly beer and contained no kitchen. What it did contain was a long zinc bar, twenty barstools, a sound system playing nineties hip-hop at a volume that made conversation a competitive sport, and the particular strain of artificial energy that bars in tourist districts generate after ten PM -- the sense that something was happening, or about to happen, or had already happened and you'd missed it.

Connor was three beers in and feeling that internal warmth, different from the air's warmth -- more generous, the kind that made the world's edges soften and your own significance expand. He was perched on a barstool between Jake and a German couple he'd been talking to for twenty minutes without remembering either of their names.

Felix was not here. Felix was rarely at the bars anymore. Since the schedule had started, Felix had become more present and less visible -- texting daily, providing packages, transferring money, but spending his evenings in his private room or out of the hostel entirely, returning late, his movements untracked and unremarked upon. Connor had noticed this without noticing it, the way you notice a change in weather without looking at the sky.

Jake was telling the German couple about the fake Rolex. This was the third time Connor had heard the story, and it had evolved: the price had increased from eighty to a hundred and fifty ringgit, the vendor had become increasingly aggressive, and Jake's negotiation failure had been reframed as a deliberate act of magnanimity. "I let the guy have it," Jake was saying, his backward cap tilted at the angle of maximum sincerity. "It's, like, their economy, dude. Trickle-down tourism."

Connor laughed. The laugh was genuine. Jake's gift was the opposite of Connor's: where Connor curated stories for maximum impression, Jake told them with zero awareness of how they landed, which gave them an accidental honesty that was funnier than any calculated joke.

It was at the tail end of the Rolex story that David arrived.

He appeared on the barstool beside Connor the way people appeared on barstools in places like this -- without preamble, without introduction, materialising from the crowd like a chemical precipitate. He ordered a Tiger, drank a third of it in one motion, and set the bottle down with the deliberate care of a man who was pacing himself for a long night.

David was approximately forty. Australian -- Connor could tell before he spoke, by the tan, the deep crow's feet, the particular brand of stubble that Australians cultivated the way the French cultivated scarves. He wore a faded grey T-shirt, cargo shorts, and the expression of someone who had been somewhere recently that he hadn't come back from entirely.

"G'day," Connor said, because one Australian greeting another in a foreign bar was a gravitational inevitability. "Where you from?"

"Perth. You?"

"Melbourne."

"Right. Hawthorn?"

Connor blinked. "How'd you know?"

"Wild guess. You look like Hawthorn." He said *Hawthorn* the way Perth people said anything about Melbourne's eastern suburbs -- with a precision that managed to be simultaneously accurate and insulting.

"I'll take that as a compliment."

"You probably would."

David drank. Connor drank. The nineties hip-hop transitioned to nineties R&B, and two British girls at the end of the bar began singing along to TLC's "No Scrubs" with the passionate inaccuracy of people who'd learned the words phonetically.

"How long you been in KL?" David asked.

"Three weeks, give or take. Loving it. Best city in Southeast Asia, reckon."

"It's a good city." David's voice was level, careful, the voice of a man calibrating how much to say. "I've been here before. Few times. Back when I was younger. Traveling."

"Yeah? Backpacking?"

"Something like that." He drank. "I'm here for something different this time. Visiting someone."

"Oh yeah? Mate of yours?"

David looked at Connor. The look lasted two seconds. In those two seconds, Connor saw something in David's eyes that he would later describe to himself as tiredness but which was actually something deeper -- a bone-deep weariness, the kind that comes from carrying a story too long and telling it too many times.

"My brother," David said. "He's in Kajang Prison."

The words arrived at the bar and sat between them. Connor's hand paused, the beer bottle halfway to his mouth. Kajang Prison. He didn't know what Kajang Prison was, but the word *prison* was clear enough to change the temperature.

"Shit," Connor said. "What happened?"

David turned his bottle on the bar, rotating it slowly between his palms. The label -- Tiger Beer, orange and gold -- moved in a circle, the tiger's face appearing and disappearing.

"My brother Steve. Thirty-two when it happened. He was backpacking. Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia. You know the route."

Connor knew the route. He'd done the route. He was doing the route.

"He was in KL. Staying in a hostel in Chinatown. Not yours -- a different one, closer to the river. He'd been here about a month. Made friends. Met some people."

David paused. The "No Scrubs" performance had reached its crescendo. Jake was clapping.

"He met a guy. An older guy, European. Charming. Had money, had connections, knew everyone. My brother liked him. Trusted him. Started doing favors for him -- carrying things around the city. Packages, envelopes. My brother thought it was legit. Import-export, the guy told him. Electronics."

Connor's beer was still halfway to his mouth. He lowered it. The warmth of three beers was receding, replaced by something cooler, something that moved through his chest like a cold draught through an open door.

"He carried packages for this guy for about six weeks," David said. "The money was good. Really good. Better than anything my brother had earned in his life. He stopped questioning it. Stopped thinking about it. Just carried the bags, collected the money, lived the life."

The bar noise was there -- the music, the voices, the clinking -- but Connor heard it from a distance now, as though someone had turned the volume down on everything except David's voice, which was close and clear and moving through the space between them with the weight of something that had been said many times and never got lighter.

"Then he got arrested. Highway checkpoint. North-South Expressway, heading to Penang." David pronounced *Penang* the Australian way, flat and final. "Police pulled the bus over. Drug dog went straight to his bag. Suitcase, actually -- the guy had asked him to take a suitcase this time, said it was a bigger order. My brother didn't check what was inside. He'd never checked."

Connor set his beer on the bar. The condensation ran down the bottle and pooled on the zinc, a small circle of water that he watched as though it contained something worth seeing.

"Methamphetamine. In the lining of the suitcase. Three hundred grams." David said the number the way you'd say a temperature reading at a hospital -- factual, clinical, already knowing what it meant. "Fifty grams triggers the mandatory death penalty in Malaysia. He had six times that."

The bar pulsed. The R&B played. The British girls had moved on to Destiny's Child. Jake was trying to teach the German couple how to do a keg stand with a barstool, which was physically impossible but entertainingly attempted.

"That was five years ago," David said. "He's been in Kajang since. The death sentence was handed down in 2022. It's been through three appeals. All failed. He's on death row."

The words *death row* landed on the bar like stones dropped from a height. Connor heard them hit. He felt the impact in his stomach, in his hands, in the suddenly cold surface of the beer bottle he was holding.

"The guy who recruited him -- the European, the charmer -- was gone before the police even opened the suitcase. Just vanished. Nobody at the hostel knew his real name. He'd paid cash, given a fake passport at check-in. The CCTV at the hostel had been 'malfunctioning' for the whole period. My brother was the only person arrested. The only name on the evidence. The only face on the camera at the bus station."

David finished his beer. Set the empty bottle on the bar with a care that was almost reverent, the way you set down something fragile.

"He was the mule," David said. "That's what they call it. The person who carries the drugs doesn't know what they're carrying, or doesn't want to know. They're expendable. If they get caught, the network cuts them loose. No connection. No evidence. Just some backpacker with a suitcase full of meth and a story about import-export that no court in the world would believe."

Connor was aware that he should speak. The social mechanics of the situation demanded a response -- sympathy, outrage, something. But the machine in his head was running at full speed, processing David's story not as a story but as a pattern, a template, a description of events that bore a resemblance to other events that Connor did not want to compare them to.

*It's different,* the machine said. *David's brother's situation is completely different. Felix is a photographer. The packages are phone components. I've done the deliveries and nothing has happened. Nothing has happened.*

"That's..." Connor started. The sentence wanted to be *that's exactly what's happening to me* but the machine intercepted it and rerouted and what came out was: "That's awful, mate. I'm really sorry."

"Thanks." David nodded. The nod was small, practiced, the nod of a man who had received condolences so many times they'd become a ritual rather than a comfort. "I visit him every year. Four times now. The prison is... it's not what you'd imagine. It's worse. The heat, the overcrowding. Steve's in a cell with eight other men. He gets one hour of exercise a day. He's lost twenty kilograms."

"Is there anything -- can he get out? Can the government do something?"

"The Australian government has made representations. Diplomatic channels. Legal aid. But the Malaysian courts are independent, and the law is the law. Mandatory sentencing means mandatory. The judge couldn't have given him less even if he'd wanted to."

David ordered another beer. The barman -- a young Malay guy with a nose ring and a Metallica T-shirt -- popped the cap and set it down without making eye contact. The economy of bar service in places where stories like this were not uncommon.

"The hardest part," David said, "isn't the sentence. I mean, it is -- it's a death sentence, it's the hardest thing there is. But the hardest part is knowing he didn't have to be there. He could have said no. He could have opened one of the packages. He could have Googled 'Malaysian drug laws' and found out in thirty seconds what the penalties were. The information was there. It was everywhere. Signs at the airport. Travel advisories. Guidebook warnings. He just... didn't look."

The word *didn't look* moved through Connor's mind like something alive.

"He trusted the wrong person," David said. "That's it. That's the whole story. He trusted a man who was designed to be trusted, who made trusting him feel natural, who made not trusting him feel like paranoia. And the man was designed that way because design is what predators do. They design the approach, and they design the friendship, and they design the dependency, and by the time you realise you're in a trap, the trap is the only structure you have."

Connor drank. The beer was warm. The bar was loud. Somewhere behind them, Jake had successfully performed a modified keg stand that involved balancing on one hand while a German woman poured beer into his mouth, and the resulting applause was genuine and surprised.

"Can I ask you something?" Connor said.

"Sure."

"Did your brother ever... I mean, did he suspect? Before he got caught. Did he ever think something was off?"

David looked at him. The look was longer this time -- three seconds, four -- and in it, Connor saw something that might have been recognition. The recognition of one Australian looking at another and seeing the same species of confidence, the same architecture of denial, the same belief that the rules of the universe contained a clause excusing people who looked like them from consequences that applied to everyone else.

"He says he didn't," David said. "He says he never suspected. But I know my brother. He's not stupid. He's... trusting. Optimistic. The kind of bloke who assumes people are good because he's good. And he was broke and the money was easy and the alternative was going home and getting a job and admitting the whole travel thing was just running away."

The sentence hit Connor in the chest. It didn't hit the wall. It went through the wall and into the space behind, the space where the things he didn't examine lived.

"I think he knew," David said. "Not consciously. Not in a way he could articulate. But somewhere in there, he knew. He just chose not to look. Because looking would have meant stopping, and stopping would have meant facing everything the travel and the money and the friendship were helping him avoid."

The music changed. Someone had commandeered the bar's Bluetooth and "Bohemian Rhapsody" erupted at maximum volume, the opening piano notes cutting through the conversation like something from a different world. The bar surged with the energy of collective recognition -- drunk tourists singing along, hands in the air, the song functioning as it always did in bars: as a temporary religion.

Connor stood up. Not because the conversation was over but because his body was making a decision his mind hadn't caught up with. The barstool scraped on the floor. He reached for his wallet, pulled out a fifty-ringgit note, and placed it on the bar.

"This one's on me," he said.

"You don't have to--"

"I know. I want to." He paused. The sentence wanted more. It wanted *because your brother is in prison for doing what I'm doing and the least I can do is buy you a beer.* But the machine ran, and the sentence that came out was: "Take care of yourself, mate. And your brother. I hope it works out."

David nodded. "Thanks." He paused, then: "How long are you staying in KL?"

"Haven't decided."

"Can I give you some advice? Unsolicited?"

"Sure."

"Be careful who you trust. That's all. In this city, in this part of the world. Be careful who you call a friend, and be careful what you carry, and if someone offers you easy money, ask yourself why the money is easy. Because the money is never easy. The ease is the product. The ease is what they're selling you."

Connor heard the words. Every one of them. They entered his ears and moved through the auditory cortex and arrived in the part of his brain where meaning was assembled, and the meaning was clear. It was the clearest warning he had received -- clearer than Priya's concern, clearer than Tomoko's suspicion, clearer than Mei Ling's instruction, clearer than Mama Siti's proverb. It was the testimony of a man whose brother was on death row for doing the exact thing Connor was doing, delivered without ambiguity, without metaphor, without the comfortable distance of hypothetical.

Connor heard it. He understood it. And then he did what he always did with information that threatened the structure of his self-deception.

He changed the channel.

"Will do, mate. Cheers."

He clapped David on the shoulder -- the Australian gesture of solidarity, which functions simultaneously as a greeting, a farewell, and a way to end a conversation you can no longer sustain. David's shoulder was thin under the faded T-shirt. The man felt smaller than he looked, as though the story had been holding him up and now that he'd told it, the support had gone.

Connor walked back to Jake and the Germans. He ordered a shot of something amber. He drank it. He ordered another. The bar noise reassembled around him -- the music, the laughter, Jake's voice rising above it all with the indestructible buoyancy of a man who had never been troubled by a thought he couldn't resolve with another beer.

"Dude, who was that?" Jake asked.

"Just some bloke. His brother's in prison here."

"No way. What for?"

"Drugs."

"Shit. That's heavy."

"Yeah."

Jake processed this for approximately four seconds -- the amount of time Jake allocated to heavy topics before returning to baseline. "Want to do shots? The German girl's buying."

"Yeah. Shots."

They did shots. They did more shots. The bar swelled and contracted with the rhythm of the night, the crowd thickening past midnight and thinning after one. Connor drank with the specific, deliberate purpose of a man trying to flood an engine -- pouring alcohol into the machine until the rationalizations blurred and the fear numbed and the only thing left was the warm, idiot comfort of being too drunk to think.

It worked. Alcohol was reliable that way.

---

---

The hours between midnight and two AM blurred the way they always blurred on Changkat -- alcohol and bass and the friction of bodies in a space too small to hold them.

Connor moved from the bar to the dance floor to the smoking area, cycling through the stations of a night out with the practiced efficiency of a man who had done this in thirty cities. At every station, David's story followed him. It didn't sit on the surface of his thoughts -- he'd pushed it below, buried it under shots and music and the deliberate energy of a man trying to outrun something that wasn't chasing him. But it was there, the way a stone is there at the bottom of a river: invisible, immovable, changing the current.

In the smoking area -- a concrete courtyard strung with fairy lights and populated by the international fellowship of people who had quit smoking in their home countries but not abroad -- he stood next to a group of Malaysians. Young, well-dressed, speaking a rapid mix of English and Malay that Connor had learned to identify as "Manglish" -- the colloquial hybrid that sounded like two languages having an argument they were both enjoying.

One of them, a woman in her twenties with dyed blue hair and a T-shirt that said NASI LEMAK IS MY LOVE LANGUAGE, noticed Connor listening and switched to English.

"You're Australian, right? I can tell from the tan lines."

"Is it that obvious?"

"Very." She grinned. "First time in KL?"

"Been here three weeks."

"Three weeks! You like it?"

"Love it. Best food in the world."

This was the correct answer. The woman's grin widened and she launched into a five-minute lecture on where to find the best nasi kandar (a stall in Bangsar that had no name, you just had to know), the best cendol (a cart near Masjid India that only appeared on Tuesdays), and the best char kway teow (her grandmother's kitchen, but second-best was a hawker in Kepong who used so much lard his cholesterol was a medical concern).

Connor listened. He laughed. He took notes in his phone -- the real phone, the Instagram phone, the phone that existed in the world of food recommendations and normal conversations and people who didn't have brothers on death row.

"Be careful though," the woman said, as the conversation wound down and her friends beckoned from inside. "KL is safe, but it's not -- how do you say -- it's not without teeth. Don't walk alone in Chow Kit after midnight. Don't flash your phone on the LRT. And for the love of God, don't get involved with anything illegal. This country does not play."

She said it lightly, the way locals said it -- a casual caveat, a speed bump in an otherwise smooth conversation. But the word *illegal* caught on something in Connor's chest and held there, a fishhook in soft tissue.

"Wouldn't dream of it," he said.

"Good boy." She patted his arm with the maternal authority of a woman eight years his junior. "Enjoy your stay. Eat the cendol on Tuesday."

She disappeared inside. The fairy lights swayed. Connor stood in the smoking area and didn't smoke and felt the fishhook pull.

---

They walked home at two AM, Connor and Jake, weaving through the Changkat aftermath -- the street littered with cigarette butts and promotional flyers and the occasional shoe, the bars disgorging their final patrons into the humid dark, taxis lined up at the intersection like yellow insects drawn to the remaining light.

Jake was monologuing about a girl he'd talked to at the bar -- Swedish, or Finnish, or possibly Estonian, he wasn't sure, but she had great hair and had given him her Instagram and this was basically a proposal. Connor listened with the fractional attention of a man whose mind was elsewhere, in a prison forty kilometres south, in a holding cell, in the back of a bus on the North-South Expressway where a drug dog was moving down the aisle and the suitcase in the overhead compartment was humming with the energy of three hundred grams of compressed catastrophe.

*It's not the same,* the machine said. The machine was drunk but still operational, still producing its product, still smoothing the rough edges of reality into shapes Connor could hold without cutting himself. *David's brother was unlucky. David's brother trusted the wrong person. I trust Felix, and Felix is different, because Felix is my mate, and David's brother's recruiter was a stranger, and the situations are completely different.*

They were not completely different. They were, in fact, identical -- the same mechanism, the same design, the same trap baited with the same friendship and the same money and the same carefully engineered ignorance. The only difference was time. David's brother was five years ahead of Connor on the same road, and the road's destination was the same, and the road did not fork or bend or offer exits. It went in one direction, and the direction was Kajang Prison, and beyond Kajang, a room with a rope, and beyond the room, nothing.

But Connor could not see the road because Connor was on the road, and when you are on a road, the road looks like the ground, and the ground looks like the only option, and the only option looks like a choice.

They reached Petaling Street. The market was collapsed for the night -- stalls shuttered, tarps tied, the corridor empty except for a few last food vendors sweating over cooling grills. The Guan Di Temple was dark, its red doors shut, incense still leaking from the gaps. The Chinese medicine store was a wall of shadows behind glass.

Wei's phone repair shop was dark too. For once, the fluorescent light was off. The cluttered window display -- cracked phones, coiled cables, the handwritten sign -- was barely visible in the street's ambient light. Connor glanced at it as he passed. A reflex. The glance lasted less than a second and contained no conscious thought, but his eyes registered something his mind would not process until much later: on the counter inside the shop, barely visible through the glass, a digital scale. The kind with a flat metal platform and an LCD readout. The kind used to weigh things in grams.

He walked past.

The hostel's red lanterns were off -- they were on a timer, midnight shutdown, though their glow lingered in the retina the way afterimages did. Connor pushed through the front door. The reception counter was unattended, Mei Ling long gone, replaced by the honesty system of an unlocked door and the assumption that backpackers who came home at two AM were not a security risk.

Jake headed for Dorm 1. "Night, dude. Epic night."

"Night, mate."

Connor climbed the staircase. On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters waited under their layer of paint, patient and illegible. He pushed open the door to Dorm 3. The dorm was dark. Bodies in bunks, the anonymous shapes of sleeping travelers, the collective breathing of strangers sharing air.

He sat on the edge of Bed 7 and pulled off his flip-flops. His head was thick with beer and shots and the residue of David's story, which had settled into his consciousness the way silt settles after a flood -- covering everything, changing the colour of the water, making it impossible to see the bottom.

The burner phone was on the mattress where he'd left it. He picked it up. No messages. The screen glowed briefly, a flat blue rectangle in the dark, then dimmed. He set it down.

He lay back. The blue towel was under his pillow. He pulled it out and draped it across his chest, the ritual gesture, the comfort object, the microfiber membrane between him and the world.

*Mandatory death sentence.*

He closed his eyes.

*No exceptions for foreigners.*

He turned over.

*Be careful who you trust.*

He pulled the towel tighter.

*The ease is what they're selling you.*

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.* The building creaked. The city hummed. And in the dark, in the quiet, in the space between waking and sleep, the machine faltered.

It didn't stop. The machine never stopped. But it faltered -- a skip, a stutter, a momentary gap in the continuous production of reassurance. And in that gap, in the half-second of silence between one lie and the next, Connor Briggs felt the full weight of what he was doing land on his chest like a stone, and the weight was real and the stone was real and for one fractured, terrifying moment he saw himself as he was: a man carrying packages for a stranger, in a country that killed people for carrying packages, and the packages were not phone components, and he knew they were not phone components, and he had always known, and the knowing was the thing the machine existed to bury.

The moment lasted. It lasted the way a match lasts -- bright, brief, illuminating the dark with a clarity that was almost cruel. He saw the room. He saw the bed. He saw the towel on his chest. He saw the two phones on the mattress. He saw the schedule in his daypack. He saw the name on the bed frame.

Then the moment passed.

The machine recovered. The gears caught. The production resumed. The rationalizations arrived in their familiar order -- *it's different, I'm different, Felix is different, the packages are different, the money is different, I'm Australian, she'll be right, nothing's happened, nothing will happen* -- and the stone on his chest dissolved into the general numbness of four AM and six beers and the body's desperate need for sleep.

Connor slept. The building held him. And in Kajang Prison, forty kilometres south, a man named Steve who had once been a backpacker in a Chinatown hostel stared at a concrete ceiling and counted the days, which was what you did when the days were all you had, when the days were numbered, when the number had been set by a judge in a courtroom and the number meant the days would end and after the days ended there was nothing, just the ceiling and the concrete and the memory of a bar in KL where someone had offered him easy money and he had said yes without asking why the money was easy.

Two men in two rooms in the same city. One with a sentence. One carrying the evidence for his.

Dawn was coming.

---

Morning came the way KL mornings came: with heat and noise and the call to prayer and the smell of Mama Siti's kitchen.

Connor woke at ten. Headache. Dry mouth. The specific hangover that was equal parts alcohol and sleep deprivation, the body's invoice for the previous night's expenditure. He lay in Bed 7 and waited for the room to stabilise -- the ceiling fan spinning, the light from the air well making the dorm's contents visible in soft grey: the bunks, the lockers, the backpacks, the accumulated personal effects of eight transient lives.

The burner phone buzzed.

He reached for it with the practised reflex that two weeks of the schedule had already built into his nervous system. The message was from Felix:

*Friday delivery. Package at Wei's shop. Pick up by 11. Drop at Bukit Bintang, Lot 22B. Danny. RM400.*

Connor read the message. He read it again. The words were the same words they always were -- a pickup, a destination, a name, a number. The machinery of the schedule, ticking over, indifferent to what he'd heard the night before, indifferent to David's story, indifferent to the stone on his chest that had not fully dissolved.

He lay there. Through the air well, the sounds and smells of the hostel's morning: water running, a door closing, the sulfurous whiff from the drains that the heat always stirred, the clang of something in the kitchen, Mama Siti's voice saying something in Malay that contained the word *bodoh*, which Connor had learned meant *stupid* and which Mama Siti applied to a generous range of subjects including the stove, the plumbing, the government, and most of her guests.

He could stop. The thought was there, clear and available, sitting at the front of his mind like an exit sign above a door. He could text Felix and say *I'm done*. He could delete the schedule, throw away the burner phone, and go back to being a broke backpacker with a cracked phone and 4,200 followers and a parents' deposit that kept him alive. He could go home. He could walk out of this building and take a Grab to KLIA2 and board a flight to Melbourne and be in his mother's kitchen by tomorrow morning, eating Vegemite toast and being asked about his plans and knowing that the question had no answer but that the asking was not dangerous.

He could stop.

The thought sat there. The exit sign glowed.

He picked up the burner phone and typed: *On it.*

The exit sign went dark.

Connor Briggs swung his legs off Bed 7, pulled on a singlet -- GOOD VIBES ONLY, the same one from yesterday, slightly beer-scented -- and went downstairs to collect a package from a phone repair shop that repaired no phones, to carry it across a city that would kill him for carrying it, for money that was not money but the price of his own ignorance, which he had placed on the counter and accepted in exchange for the life that was already ending, one delivery at a time.

Mama Siti watched him pass through the kitchen. She did not offer nasi lemak. She did not speak. She stirred her pot and looked at the boy and her lips moved once, forming a word that might have been a prayer or might have been a proverb or might have been the Malay word for *gone*, which was *pergi*, which was what you said when someone left a room and also what you said when someone left the world.

The front door opened. The heat rushed in. Connor stepped through.

The door closed behind him.

Mama Siti stirred.
# Chapter 14: The Law

The morning started with a delivery that almost didn't happen.

It was Day 21, a Tuesday, and the schedule said Brickfields -- Lorong 3, the "Blue Door," RM350. Connor collected the package from Felix's room at nine. Sports bag again, black nylon, zipped shut. The weight was the same as last time -- that particular density, that specific heft that he'd stopped thinking about and started accepting, the way you accept the weight of your own body.

The Grab took him south through the morning traffic, past the gleaming cylinder of KL Tower and the construction cranes that lined the sky like skeletal birds. The driver played Tamil radio, the music rich and complex, tablas and strings and a voice that climbed and descended in patterns Connor couldn't follow but found hypnotic.

The Blue Door was exactly that -- a metal door painted a blue that had faded to the colour of old jeans, set into the wall of a narrow lorong behind a row of shophouses in Brickfields. The lorong smelled of curry leaf and diesel and the warm, composting sweetness of overripe jackfruit from a tree that hung over someone's back wall. Connor knocked twice. The door opened. A woman this time -- middle-aged, Indian-Malaysian, wearing a salwar kameez in forest green, her expression carrying the professional neutrality of someone conducting a transaction. She took the bag. The door closed.

RM350.

He walked back through Brickfields. Little India -- the neighbourhood's unofficial name -- was in its midmorning rhythm. Garland shops were stringing jasmine and marigold into thick ropes for the temples. A banana leaf restaurant was opening its shutters, the staff laying down fresh leaves on metal trays with the reverent precision of altar preparation. Bollywood music leaked from a textile shop where mannequins wore saris in colours that existed nowhere in nature and everywhere in dreams.

Connor stopped at a tea stall. Teh tarik -- the pulled tea, milky and sweet, poured in a long golden arc from glass to glass. He drank it standing up at the counter, watching the garland maker across the street thread flowers with hands that moved like water, and he felt the warmth of the tea and the warmth of the money and the warmth of a Tuesday morning in a city he had come to know, and the warmth was good, and the warmth was the problem.

Because warmth was what made the carrying possible. Not the money -- the money was incentive, but incentive alone doesn't overcome the instinct for self-preservation. It was the warmth. The warmth of routine. The warmth of a city that had become home. The warmth of belonging to something -- a schedule, a network, a structure that gave his days shape and his wallet weight. The warmth made the packages invisible, made the drops ordinary, made the whole arrangement feel like life rather than the specific, engineered mechanism that would end it.

He finished his tea. He went home. He spent the afternoon at Grind Culture, posting for Pacific Soul, and in the evening he met Priya.

---

Priya had printed the law.

Not summarised it, not paraphrased it, not read about it in a guidebook and referenced it in conversation. She had found an internet café on Jalan Tun H.S. Lee -- one of the last surviving specimens, a narrow room of ancient Dells and rattling keyboards that charged RM3 per hour and smelled of instant coffee and the stale urgency of travelers who needed to print boarding passes -- and she had sat at terminal number four and searched the Malaysian legal database and found the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, Section 39B, and printed it.

Five pages. Single-spaced. The paper was cheap, the ink slightly smudged, the margins too narrow because the internet café's printer was calibrated for A4 and these were A4 pages but the margins had been set by someone who didn't understand margins. The header read: LAWS OF MALAYSIA -- ACT 234 -- DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT 1952. The text beneath was small and dense and written in the particular English of Commonwealth legislation -- formal, archaic, devastating in its precision.

She had highlighted the relevant sections in yellow. The yellow marker -- borrowed from the hostel's communal stationery drawer, which contained three pens (one working), a roll of tape, and a selection of markers abandoned by travelers who had used them to write their names on food in the communal fridge -- bled slightly into the cheap paper, creating halos around the words it was meant to emphasise.

The highlighted passages said this:

*Section 39B(1): Any person who, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not such other person is in Malaysia --*

*(a) traffics in a dangerous drug;*

*(b) offers to traffic in a dangerous drug; or*

*(c) does or offers to do an act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a dangerous drug,*

*shall be guilty of an offence against this Act and shall be punished on conviction with death.*

And this:

*Section 37(da): Any person who is found to have in his custody or under his control --*

*(i) anything which contains more than 5 grammes of heroin or morphine;*

*(ii) anything which contains more than 15 grammes of cannabis;*

*(iii) anything which contains more than 50 grammes of methamphetamine...*

*shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be trafficking in the said dangerous drug.*

Priya had read these passages six times. She had sat at terminal four in the internet café with the screen casting blue light on her glasses and the ceiling fan overhead turning with the same lazy inevitability as the one in the hostel, and she had read the law six times because the first five times she kept hoping the words would rearrange themselves into something less absolute.

They didn't. The law was the law. The law said *death*. The law said *presumed*. The law said fifty grams of methamphetamine and you were presumed to be trafficking and the sentence was mandatory and the sentence was death and the judge had no discretion and the defendant had no exemption and nationality was irrelevant and ignorance was irrelevant and the gap between carrying a package and dying for carrying a package was measured in grams.

She had paid RM6 for the printing and walked back to the hostel through the afternoon heat with the five pages folded in her Lonely Planet, between the chapter on Kuala Lumpur and the chapter on Penang, and she had waited.

She waited through the afternoon. She waited through dinner -- she and Connor eating roti canai at the mamak stall on the corner, the conversation careful and warm, two people navigating around the topic they both knew was coming. She waited through the evening, through the common room hours when the hostel's social life assembled and dispersed, through Jake's announcement that he was going to Changkat ("Again? You were just there." "Dude, it's Changkat. It's always just there."), through Tomoko's silent transit from the staircase to the rooftop with her camera.

She waited until the common room was nearly empty -- just her and Connor and the TV playing a nature documentary in which a komodo dragon was pursuing something that didn't want to be caught. Then she set her Lonely Planet on the coffee table, opened it to the marked page, and removed the five printed sheets.

"I need to show you something."

Connor was on the sofa, phone in hand, scrolling with the absent focus of a man using his thumb to avoid his thoughts. He looked up.

"What's that?"

"The law." She placed the pages on the coffee table, the yellow highlights facing up, the words DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT visible even from his angle. "Malaysian drug law. I printed it."

The reaction was immediate and involuntary. Connor's body shifted -- a small, physical withdrawal, the torso leaning back an inch, the shoulders pulling together, the instinctive recoil of an animal presented with something it recognised as dangerous before the brain had time to intervene.

"Priya--"

"Just read it. Please. Just read this one section."

She pointed to the highlighted passage: Section 39B(1). The word *death* in yellow.

Connor didn't look at the page. He looked at Priya. She was sitting on the edge of the armchair, her back straight, her hands flat on her thighs. She was wearing her glasses and a white T-shirt and her hair was in its usual braid and she looked, in the amber light of the common room, like a doctor about to deliver a diagnosis that the patient had not asked for and would not accept.

"We've been over this--"

"No, we haven't. We've talked around it. You've told me it's phone accessories. I've told you I'm worried. We've had the same non-conversation three times and nothing changes. This is different. This is the actual law. Read it."

Her voice was steady but there was a pressure behind it -- the pressure of a woman who had been holding something back for two weeks and had decided, tonight, in this room, that holding it back was no longer a kindness. The pressure was love. Connor would not recognise this until much later, in a room where recognising it could no longer help him.

He looked at the page.

The words were small and dense and they sat on the cheap paper with the calm, immovable weight of something that had been true for seventy years. *Shall be guilty of an offence against this Act and shall be punished on conviction with death.* The yellow highlighting made the word *death* brighter, louder, more present. It was not a metaphorical death, not a figurative death, not the death that people meant when they said "I'd die for a coffee." It was the death of the body, permanent, administered by the state, in a building forty kilometres south of where Connor was sitting.

He read the sentence. His eyes moved across the words. The words entered his brain. Then the machine started running.

"Okay," he said. "So Malaysia has harsh drug laws. I know that. Everyone knows that. What's your point?"

"My point is--" Priya leaned forward. Her glasses caught the lamp's light and for a moment her eyes were invisible behind twin circles of reflection. "Connor, do you know what fifty grams looks like? It's this much." She held up her hand, cupped, the fingers forming a hollow the size of a tennis ball. "That's it. That's the threshold. If you're caught carrying that much methamphetamine, you're automatically presumed to be a trafficker. The prosecution doesn't have to prove intent. The burden shifts to you. You have to prove you *weren't* trafficking."

"I'm not carrying methamphetamine."

"How do you know?"

The question was a scalpel. It cut through the layers -- through the confidence, through the certainty, through the phone-accessories story and the logistics explanation and the Felix-is-a-photographer narrative -- and it touched something underneath. Something that flinched.

"Because Felix told me--"

"Felix told you it was phone components. Felix told you it was import-export. Felix told you it was logistics. Felix told you a lot of things. Has Felix ever *shown* you what's in the packages?"

"He can't. The clients--"

"Have you ever opened one?"

"No--"

"Have you ever weighed one?"

"What? No--"

"Have you ever noticed that the packages are heavier than phone accessories should be? That the drop-offs are always in back rooms, through side entrances, with people who don't make eye contact? That Felix gave you a burner phone -- a prepaid, anonymous phone that can't be traced? That the money he pays you is always cash transfer, never documented, never receipted?"

Each question landed like a step on a staircase, each one lower than the last, each one taking them further from the surface and closer to something dark and solid. Priya's voice did not rise. It remained clinical, measured, the voice of a woman who had been trained to deliver terrible news in controlled doses. But her hands were shaking. Not visibly -- the tremor was small, internal, the kind you felt rather than saw. Connor didn't see it.

"You sound like a conspiracy theory," he said. The words came out sharp, defensive, the verbal equivalent of the physical recoil from earlier -- the body protecting itself from information that threatened the architecture of the self. "Felix is a photographer. He does consulting work. The packages are phone components. I've done fifteen deliveries and nothing has happened."

"Nothing has happened *yet*."

"Right. And nothing's going to happen. Because it's legit. Because I know what I'm doing."

Priya reached across the coffee table and picked up the printed pages. She held them in front of Connor -- not aggressively, not theatrically, but with the quiet insistence of someone holding up an X-ray of a fracture the patient insists doesn't exist.

"Section 39B. Trafficking in dangerous drugs. Punished on conviction with death. Mandatory. The judge has no choice. There is no plea bargain. There is no first-offender exception. There is no exemption for foreigners." She paused. "Connor, if what Felix is giving you contains methamphetamine -- even if you didn't know -- the law doesn't care. The law says you're a trafficker. The law says you die."

The common room was quiet. The TV documentary had moved on -- the komodo dragon had caught its prey and was consuming it with the patient efficiency of a predator that had all the time in the world. The ceiling fan turned. The red lanterns cast their warm, permanent glow, and in that glow, in the amber light that made everything soft and safe and hostel-warm, the word *die* sat between two people who looked at each other across a coffee table and saw different things.

Priya saw a man she cared about walking into traffic.

Connor saw a woman who didn't understand.

"Priya." His voice softened. The sharpness dropped away, replaced by something warmer but no less defensive -- the gentle condescension of a man explaining to a woman that her fears are unfounded. "I appreciate this. I really do. I know you care about me and I know you're worried. But you're making assumptions based on -- what? A guidebook? A law you printed from the internet? You don't know Felix. You don't know the business. You're extrapolating from fear."

"I'm extrapolating from evidence."

"What evidence? That the packages are heavy? That Felix has money? That's not evidence. That's suspicion."

"I met a photojournalist who's been covering drug trafficking in Southeast Asia for three years. A woman from Japan who photographs things for a living. She says--"

"Tomoko." Connor's voice hardened again. "You've been talking to Tomoko about me?"

"She came to me. She's concerned--"

"She's paranoid. She's a stranger who decided she doesn't like Felix and now she's spreading--"

"She's not a stranger. She's a journalist. She recognises patterns."

"Patterns." Connor laughed. The laugh was thin, humourless, the acoustic signature of a man who is running out of defences and has resorted to the one that requires no argument: ridicule. "Patterns. So now Tomoko's a pattern expert and Felix is a drug dealer and I'm a -- what? A drug mule? Is that what you think?"

The word *mule* entered the room and the room changed. Not physically -- the fans still turned, the lanterns still glowed -- but the word carried a charge that altered the air, the way static electricity alters the feeling of a room before a storm. Connor had said it. He'd said it sarcastically, dismissively, weaponising the word to make it ridiculous. But the word was not ridiculous. The word was the exact, precise, correct term for what he was. A drug mule. A person who carries drugs for someone else, unknowingly or unwillingly. The word was the truth, and he'd spoken it himself, and now it was in the room, and it could not be un-spoken.

Priya didn't flinch. "I think," she said, with the careful precision of a surgeon making an incision, "that you are carrying things you have not looked at, for a man you do not know, in a country that will kill you for it. And I think you know this. And I think the reason you won't open one of those packages is because you're afraid of what you'll find."

The sentence was the most dangerous thing anyone had said to Connor since he'd arrived in KL. Not because it was unkind -- it was the kindest thing anyone had said to him in months, possibly years -- but because it was true. And the truth, in Connor's architecture of self-deception, was the one structural element that could bring the whole building down.

He stood up. The movement was sudden, physical, the body's response to a fight-or-flight signal that the brain had been too slow to intercept. He was standing before he knew he was standing, and the standing was a decision, the decision to be above this conversation, to be on his feet while Priya was seated, to occupy more space, to assert the physical dominance that men resort to when intellectual dominance has failed.

"You know what your problem is?" he said. "You plan everything. You research everything. You print out laws and highlight them in yellow and you think that preparation is the same as understanding. But you've been here three weeks, the same as me, and you haven't lived. You've studied. You've read guidebooks and printed laws and talked to journalists and worried about things that aren't happening. And meanwhile, I've been out there. Living. Experiencing. Actually doing the thing you're too afraid to do."

He heard himself speaking and felt the familiar momentum of a rant that has escaped the control of its speaker -- the sentences building on each other, each one louder and more wrong than the last, the rhetorical engine running on anger and fear and the desperate fuel of a man who knows, somewhere beneath the noise, that the person he's yelling at is right.

Priya sat in the armchair and watched him. She did not speak. She did not flinch. She did not cry. She held the printed pages on her lap and she looked at Connor with the expression of a woman who had just watched a patient refuse treatment, and the expression was not anger and it was not contempt. It was something worse. It was the particular sorrow of someone who understands that love, by itself, cannot save a person from themselves.

"Are you finished?" she said.

He was. The rant had spent itself. The room was quiet. The komodo dragon documentary had ended, replaced by a cooking show in Mandarin.

"I'm going to bed," Connor said.

"Connor."

He stopped at the foot of the staircase. She was standing now, the printed pages in one hand, her Lonely Planet in the other, her posture straight, her face illuminated by the red lanterns in a way that made her look both ancient and young, a woman from a painting, a woman who had seen something the painter couldn't capture.

"I'm leaving this on the coffee table," she said. She placed the five pages on the table, fanning them slightly so the highlighted sections were visible. "In case you want to read them. In case you decide that knowing the truth is worth more than not knowing it."

She walked past him. Her shoulder brushed his arm. The jade bracelet -- the one he'd bought her at the night market with money from the first envelope delivery -- slid on her wrist and caught the lantern light, green and vivid and paid for with something that was not clean.

She climbed the staircase. She was gone.

Connor stood alone in the common room. The cooking show played. On the coffee table, the five printed pages sat in the amber light, the yellow highlights glowing like small fires, the word *death* visible from where he stood, the word *mandatory* visible, the word *trafficking* visible, the whole ugly architecture of the law laid out in black ink on cheap paper, waiting to be read.

He could read them. Right now. He could sit on the sofa and read five pages and know, with legal precision, exactly what would happen to him if the packages contained what Priya believed they contained. Five pages. Ten minutes. The difference between ignorance and knowledge, between the comfort of not-knowing and the terror of knowing, between the man he was and the man he'd have to become.

He looked at the pages.

He looked at the staircase.

He went upstairs.

---

On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters under the paint said nothing to him. They'd been saying nothing to him for three weeks, and they would continue to say nothing until the building was demolished or the paint was stripped or someone who could read wartime Japanese happened to pause on the landing and translate: *Processing Room 3 -- Detainees Report Here.* The building had always been a place where people were processed. The system had changed. The processing hadn't.

He passed the door to Dorm 4 -- Priya's dorm. A line of light showed under the door. She was awake. She was in there, awake, with her Lonely Planet and her knowledge and her fear for him, and the light under the door was like a hand extended, and he walked past it.

At the top of the staircase to the third floor, he almost collided with Tomoko.

She was coming down. Camera in hand -- the professional Nikon she carried everywhere, the lens cap off, as though she'd been shooting something on the third floor. In the dim hallway light, her face was unreadable, the dyed red tips of her hair dark as wine.

They looked at each other. The hallway was narrow. Neither moved.

"She told you," Connor said. Not a question.

Tomoko tilted her head. The gesture was economical, precise. "She told me she was going to talk to you. I told her what I've seen."

"And what have you seen, Tomoko? What exactly have you seen that makes you such an expert on my life?"

"I've seen Felix," she said. "I've been watching him since my first week. I've seen the packages arrive at the hostel at night. I've seen the people who bring them -- different people, always at night, always through the back entrance from the alley. I've seen Wei's shop and what happens there after midnight. And I've seen you, Connor. Every morning, going out with a bag. Coming back without one."

She spoke without emotion, without judgment, reciting observations the way a journalist recites facts -- assembled, verified, presented for the record. She was not trying to convince him. She was not trying to save him. She was documenting.

"I've taken photographs," she said. "Of the people who come at night. Of the packages. Of Felix and Wei together in the shop. I have a record."

"Great. You have a record. What are you going to do with it, Tomoko? Send it to the papers? Call the police?"

"I haven't decided."

The sentence was flat. It contained no threat and no promise. It was the sentence of a woman who had seen enough of the world to know that decisions made in hallways at midnight were rarely the right ones.

"But I want you to know," she said, "that the record exists. And that if something happens -- to you, to anyone at this hostel -- I will use it."

Connor stared at her. In the dim light, with the camera in her hand and the quiet certainty in her voice, she looked like something from a different genre -- not the dark comedy of backpacker culture but something more serious, more consequential, a woman standing at the intersection of witness and intervention and choosing, for now, to remain on the side of the former.

"Nothing is going to happen," Connor said.

Tomoko stepped past him on the narrow staircase. Her shoulder didn't touch his. The space between them was precisely maintained.

"*Ki wo tsukete*," she said. The Japanese was soft, almost inaudible. She didn't translate. She descended the staircase -- the third step didn't squeak for her -- and was gone.

Connor stood on the landing. He didn't know the phrase. He wouldn't look it up. It meant *be careful*, which was the same thing everyone had been telling him, in English and Malay and now Japanese, the same message in every language, the same warning he had been receiving and refusing since the day he arrived, the same two words that bridged every culture and every tongue and every human who had ever watched another human walk toward a cliff and tried, with nothing but words, to make them stop.

---

In Bed 7, in the dark, with the blue towel on his chest and the two phones beside him and the ceiling fan turning its endless, indifferent rotation, Connor did not sleep.

He lay on his back and stared at the underside of the bunk and thought about nothing, which was harder than thinking about something because nothing was not empty -- nothing was full of the things he was not thinking about, the pages on the coffee table and Priya's voice and the word *mule* and the word *death* and the weight of a sports bag and the face of a man named David at a bar on Changkat who had a brother in Kajang Prison.

At three AM, he got up. He crept out of the dorm, down the staircase -- the third step squeaked, louder in the empty building -- and into the common room.

The pages were still on the coffee table.

He stood over them. The common room was dark now, the lanterns off, the only light from the street lamps filtering through the front window. The pages were grey rectangles on the dark wood. He could see the yellow highlights, dimly, like reflections of something from a distance.

He reached out. His hand hovered above the pages. His fingers were close enough to feel the paper's texture -- cheap, slightly warm from the room, the surface rough.

He picked them up.

He held them in the dark. The weight was nothing -- five sheets of paper, an insignificant mass, the lightest thing he'd carried in weeks. But the weight was also everything, because the weight was knowledge, and knowledge was the thing he'd been running from since the first envelope, since the first RM200, since the first time Felix said *don't open it* and Connor obeyed.

He stood in the dark common room, in the hostel that had been a warehouse and an interrogation centre and a gambling den and a brothel, in the building that remembered every use and every user, and he held the law in his hands.

He put the pages back on the table.

He went upstairs.

In the morning, the pages would be gone. Aisha, the part-time cleaner, would collect them during her six AM sweep of the common room, mistaking them for rubbish, which in a certain sense they were -- rubbish to a man who would not read them, wasted paper, wasted ink, wasted yellow highlighter, wasted love. She would crumple them into the bin bag and they would join the compressed mass of hostel detritus -- empty bottles, food wrappers, boarding passes, the discarded evidence of lives in transit -- and the bin bag would be collected by the municipal truck at seven and carried to the Taman Beringin landfill, where the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, Section 39B, would decompose in the tropical heat alongside everything else the city no longer needed.

And Connor would go downstairs, and the table would be empty, and he would feel a brief, complex relief -- the relief of a man who has been offered salvation and declined it, and now the offer has expired, and the declining is permanent, and the permanence is a kind of freedom, the terrible freedom of a man who has chosen not to know.

He would eat Mama Siti's nasi lemak. He would check the burner phone. He would collect a package from Felix's room and carry it to Chow Kit, to Jalan Raja Bot 12, to a woman called Auntie Lim who would take the package through a beaded curtain and return with a nod, and the nod would be worth RM350, and the RM350 would join the growing balance in his account, the balance that now exceeded what his parents deposited monthly, the balance that was the proof of a life working, a life that worked, a life that was working right up until it didn't.

He would not speak to Priya. She would be at the Islamic Arts Museum, alone, sitting in the gallery of Quran manuscripts where the calligraphy was so beautiful it made her eyes water, not because of the art but because the precision of it -- the care, the intention, the refusal to be careless with something that mattered -- was the exact opposite of everything she'd witnessed in the common room the night before. She would sit with the manuscripts and think about Connor and think about the law and think about the word *death* in yellow highlight on cheap paper, and she would not cry because Priya Sharma did not cry about things she could still fight, and she had not stopped fighting, not yet, though the man she was fighting for had done everything possible to make her.

And Connor would make his delivery and collect his money and come home to the hostel and the warmth would close around him like water around a stone, and the stone would sink, and the water would smooth, and by evening the argument would be something that had happened, past tense, archived, filed in the cabinet of things-that-didn't-matter alongside every other warning he'd received and refused.

The machine would run. The machine would always run. The machine was Connor's greatest invention and his most reliable companion, more faithful than any friend, more constant than any love, working every moment of every day to produce the one product Connor could not live without: the absolute, unshakeable conviction that everything was fine.

Everything was fine.

The building breathed.

Somewhere, forty kilometres south, in Kajang Prison, a man named Steve stared at his ceiling and counted the days left on a mandatory sentence, and the number was a number that got smaller every morning, and the morning was coming, and the morning always came.
# Chapter 15: The Checkpoint

Connor had been at this for ten days, and the deliveries had begun to feel like weather.

Not in the sense that they were natural -- nothing about carrying sealed sports bags across a tropical city for a German operative was natural -- but in the sense that they had become atmospheric, part of the climate of his days, present but unremarked upon, the way humidity was present but unremarked upon after you'd been in KL long enough to stop noticing the sweat.

His schedule had settled into a rhythm. Monday: Jalan Ipoh, Mr. Tan. Tuesday: Brickfields, the Blue Door. Thursday: Chow Kit, Auntie Lim. Friday: Jalan Ipoh again, return leg. Saturday: Bukit Bintang, Lot 22B, Danny. Wednesday and Sunday: rest. The rhythm had its own music -- pickup, carry, deliver, transfer -- and the music was so regular, so unvarying, that it had migrated from the foreground of his consciousness to the background, from the category of *things I think about* to the category of *things I do without thinking*.

The money was accumulating. RM2,800 in ten days, plus the RM700 from before the schedule. His bank balance had crossed RM5,000. Five thousand ringgit. He'd never had five thousand of anything except followers, and the followers were aspirational whereas the ringgit were real, countable, spendable. He'd upgraded his toiletries from hostel-grade to the good stuff from Watsons. He'd bought three new singlets at the Petaling Street market. He'd been tipping Mama Siti double. He'd even opened a separate savings account on his banking app, though the phrase "savings account" was doing more work than the account, which contained RM1,200 that he'd already mentally allocated to a PADI diving course in Sipadan once he left KL.

If he left KL. The leaving was becoming theoretical. The staying was becoming concrete.

This was the Wednesday when the police appeared, and the concrete cracked.

---

The police appeared on a Wednesday.

It was a rest day -- no deliveries, no schedule, no burner phone buzzing with addresses and contact names. Connor was walking through Bukit Bintang at midday, alone, wearing his SUNSET CHASER singlet and the board shorts he'd been wearing since Bali, his daypack over one shoulder containing nothing more incriminating than a water bottle, a cracked phone, a portable charger, and a copy of *The Beach* he'd taken from the hostel bookshelf and had no intention of reading.

He was clean. This was the word he used in his head -- *clean* -- and the word itself was a confession, because you only describe yourself as clean when the alternative is dirty, and the fact that Connor had begun categorising his days into *carrying* and *not carrying* was a development he hadn't noticed, or had noticed and filed under the increasingly crowded heading of things-that-didn't-matter.

Bukit Bintang at midday was a sensory assault disguised as a shopping district. The monorail glided overhead on its elevated track, silent and silver against the white sky. Below, the pavement seethed: tourists photographing the Pavilion mall's glass facade, locals navigating with the purposeful weave of people who knew the shortcuts, touts for massage parlours and tailors and watch shops creating a gauntlet of cheerful persistence. The smell was durian -- always durian in this part of KL, the spiky fruit's custard-and-gasoline aroma radiating from a stall on the corner with the insistence of something that refused to be ignored.

Connor was walking toward Lot 10 for lunch -- there was a hawker food court in the basement that served the best Hokkien mee in the city, according to Felix, which was an endorsement Connor trusted with the same uncritical faith he extended to everything Felix said. He was crossing Jalan Sultan Ismail at the pedestrian signal, phone in hand, thumbing through Instagram, when the checkpoint materialised.

It hadn't been there five minutes ago. Or it had been there and he hadn't seen it, which amounted to the same thing. A police barricade -- orange and white traffic cones, a portable barrier, two police vehicles parked at angles on the pavement -- had appeared on the corner of Jalan Sultan Ismail and Jalan Bukit Bintang, at the precise intersection where foot traffic was densest and avoidance was impossible.

Six officers. Four in the standard PDRM uniform -- dark blue, peaked caps, the Royal Malaysia Police insignia on the shoulder. Two in plainclothes, distinguishable only by the badges clipped to their belts and the particular way they stood -- weight distributed, hands free, the posture of people whose job it was to watch.

Connor saw the barricade from twenty metres away. His body responded before his mind did.

The response was immediate, physiological, and completely disproportionate to the circumstances. His heart rate spiked -- he felt it in his chest, a sudden, galloping acceleration from seventy to a hundred and twenty in the time it took to take three steps. His palms went wet. Not damp from the humidity -- wet, the sudden, cold sweat of adrenaline hitting the bloodstream. His stomach dropped, the way it dropped on a turbulent flight, the body's centre of gravity shifting as though the ground had moved. His vision narrowed -- the peripheral world dimmed, the central focus sharpened, and everything in his field of view except the six police officers became less real.

This was fear. Not the ambient fear he'd been carrying since David's story, the low-grade hum that lived beneath his confidence like a bass note beneath a melody. This was acute fear, the animal kind, the fear of the rabbit that has seen the fox and cannot yet determine whether the fox has seen the rabbit.

*I'm clean,* he thought. The word again. *I'm not carrying anything. My daypack has a water bottle and a book. There's nothing illegal on me or in me or near me. I'm clean.*

The logic was sound. The fear persisted. The logic and the fear operated on different systems -- the logic on the cortex, where reasoning happened, and the fear on the amygdala, where survival happened, and the amygdala didn't care about logic because the amygdala had been calibrated by three weeks of carrying packages through this city, and the amygdala had recorded every delivery, every drop, every sports bag and its weight, and the amygdala was now doing what it was designed to do: alerting the organism that the predator was near.

Connor's feet kept walking. This was the critical thing -- his feet kept walking toward the checkpoint, because stopping would be conspicuous, and turning around would be more conspicuous, and conspicuousness was the thing he could not afford, even though he was clean, even though his daypack contained nothing, even though the worst that could happen was a passport check and a smile.

He walked toward the barricade. The pavement was crowded. Other people were passing through the checkpoint without incident -- a Malay couple with shopping bags, a group of Japanese tourists with cameras, a European man in a business suit. The officers were checking bags, asking questions, waving people through. Routine. Standard. The ordinary machinery of a police state that was not a police state but was a country with laws that carried consequences Connor had never learned.

An officer stepped into his path. Young -- mid-twenties, clean-shaven, the peaked cap casting a shadow over his eyes. His English was accented but clear.

"Good afternoon, sir. Routine check. May I see your identification?"

"Yeah, no worries." Connor's voice came out at the wrong pitch -- slightly too high, slightly too fast. He adjusted. "My passport's at the hostel. I've got a photo on my phone."

He pulled out his phone -- the real phone, the Instagram phone -- and scrolled to the passport photo he kept in his camera roll. The officer looked at it. Australian. Connor James Briggs. The photo was three years old and showed a slightly younger, slightly less tanned version of the man in front of him.

"Australian," the officer said. Not a question. An inventory item.

"Yeah, mate. Melbourne."

"How long have you been in Malaysia?"

"About three weeks."

"Purpose of visit?"

"Tourism. Backpacking."

The officer nodded. He looked at Connor's daypack. "May I check your bag, sir?"

"Sure. Go for it."

Connor slipped the daypack off his shoulder and held it open. The officer looked inside. Water bottle. *The Beach*. Portable charger. A crumpled receipt from Grind Culture. The officer's gloved hand moved the items, checking beneath, checking the pockets. Finding nothing. Because there was nothing to find.

The officer handed the bag back. "Thank you, sir. Enjoy your stay."

It was over. Thirty seconds. A passport photo, a bag check, a polite exchange. The checkpoint had examined Connor and found him unremarkable, which he was -- today, on this corner, in this moment. Tomorrow, on a different corner, carrying a different bag, he would not be unremarkable. He would be carrying enough methamphetamine to trigger a mandatory death sentence. But today was today, and the officer was already looking at the next pedestrian, and Connor was already walking away with the particular lightness that follows a spike of fear -- the giddy, post-adrenaline relief that feels like joy but is actually the body's reward system congratulating itself for surviving something that wasn't dangerous.

He was ten steps past the barrier when a voice behind him said:

"Sir."

Connor stopped. Turned. A different officer was approaching -- older, mid-forties, in plainclothes. He was compact, muscular, his dark face carrying the particular weathering of a man who had spent decades outdoors in equatorial sun. His badge said SERGEANT and his name tag said AHMAD BIN ISMAIL. He walked toward Connor with the measured pace of a man who had been watching him since before the checkpoint and had decided, in the way that experienced officers decide things, that this conversation was worth having.

"Sir, a moment." Sergeant Ahmad's English was better than the younger officer's -- the accent lighter, the vocabulary more precise, the product of years of dealing with foreign nationals. He stood in front of Connor with his hands loosely clasped behind his back and his weight centered and his eyes reading Connor the way a radiologist reads a scan -- not the surface but the structures beneath it, the hidden architecture of a person under stress.

"Is there a problem?" Connor said.

"No problem, sir. Just a conversation." Ahmad smiled. The smile was professional, warm, and entirely unrelated to warmth. "You said you're backpacking. Three weeks in KL. That's a long time for a backpacker. Most tourists pass through in three or four days."

"I like it here."

"KL is a wonderful city. What do you like about it?"

"The food. The people. The energy."

Ahmad nodded as though these were the correct answers on a form he was filling out. "And where are you staying?"

"A hostel. In Chinatown. Petaling Street."

"The Lantern Hostel?"

The name landed like a coin on glass -- small, clear, impossible to ignore. Connor felt something tighten in his chest. Ahmad knew the hostel. Ahmad knew the hostel by name. This was not random. This was not routine.

"Yeah," Connor said. "That's the one."

"I know it. Old building. Uncle Razak's place." Ahmad's smile remained, but behind it, a different expression was forming -- the expression of a man assembling information in real time, connecting dots that the person in front of him didn't know were dots. "Good hostel. Interesting history."

"Yeah, Uncle Razak told me about it. The Japanese occupation, the--"

"Razak likes to talk." Ahmad's voice dropped a register -- not louder, not aggressive, but more focused, the conversational equivalent of a camera lens narrowing. "Do you know why I'm talking to you, Connor?"

He'd used his name. Connor's name, which he'd given to the younger officer on his phone screen, was now in Ahmad's mouth, and the use of it was deliberate, a signal that this conversation had moved from the territory of routine check into the territory of something else.

"No."

"I'm talking to you because you're an Australian backpacker who has been in Kuala Lumpur for three weeks, which is unusual. You're staying at a hostel in Chinatown that I know well. And when you approached this checkpoint, your body language changed."

Connor said nothing. Ahmad watched him saying nothing.

"You were walking normally. Relaxed. Phone in hand, like everyone else. Then you saw us, and your shoulders came up, and your pace changed, and your hand went to your bag. These are things I'm trained to notice. They don't mean anything by themselves. But they're things I notice."

The afternoon sun was directly overhead. Connor could feel it on the back of his neck, on his bare arms, on the top of his head. The heat was there but he was cold, the cold of adrenaline's second wave, the cold that comes when the body realises the danger has not passed but has merely changed form.

"I was just surprised," Connor said. "I wasn't expecting a checkpoint."

"Nobody expects checkpoints. That's the point." Ahmad's smile softened into something that was almost genuine. "Sir, I'm going to tell you something. It's not an accusation. It's a piece of information."

He paused. A motorcycle passed on Jalan Sultan Ismail, its engine cutting through the air like a tear in fabric. A woman at the durian stall laughed. The monorail hummed overhead.

"Malaysia is not a game, sir." Ahmad spoke the words with the calm, unembellished directness of a man who had said them before and would say them again and had long ago stopped hoping they would make a difference. "This country has laws. Some of those laws carry penalties that are -- severe. More severe than what you may be used to in Australia. The Dangerous Drugs Act, for example. Section 39B. I assume you've heard of it."

"Yeah. They had signs at the airport."

"They did. Signs. Warnings. The information is available. My concern--" He paused again, and in the pause, Connor saw something shift in Ahmad's expression: the professionalism thinned, and beneath it, briefly, was the face of a man who was tired. Tired of saying the same thing to the same kind of person and watching them nod and walk away and come back in handcuffs. "My concern is that the signs are seen and not read. The warnings are heard and not understood. Young travelers come to this city and they assume that the laws apply to other people. They assume that their passport is a shield. It is not."

The words settled on Connor like rain -- each one landing, each one cold, each one absorbed into the fabric of his shirt and his skin and his consciousness, leaving marks he'd feel later.

"I'm not doing anything illegal," Connor said.

"I hope not." Ahmad reached into his pocket and produced a business card. White, simple, the PDRM crest in blue and gold. SERGEANT AHMAD BIN ISMAIL. NARCOTICS DIVISION -- DANG WANGI. A phone number. An email.

Narcotics Division. The card said Narcotics Division. Ahmad was not a random officer at a random checkpoint. Ahmad was narcotics. Ahmad was the man who arrested people for carrying the thing that Connor might be carrying.

"If you ever need help," Ahmad said, placing the card in Connor's hand, "or if you become aware of something that concerns you, this number is direct. Day or night."

Connor took the card. The cardstock was thick, crisp, the ink sharp. It sat in his palm like a small, white brick.

"Thank you," Connor said. "But I'm fine. Really."

Ahmad looked at him for a long moment. The look was the longest anyone had given Connor since he'd arrived in KL -- longer than Priya's diagnostic stare, longer than Tomoko's watchful assessment, longer than Felix's calculating gaze. It was the look of a man who had been doing this job for twenty years and had developed, over those years, the ability to see through the surface of a person and into the architecture beneath. What Ahmad saw, Connor would never know. But the look ended with a nod -- not the brisk nod of a concluded transaction but the slow, heavy nod of a man who has recognised something and accepted that recognition is not enough.

"Enjoy your stay, sir. Be safe."

He turned and walked back to the checkpoint. His posture was straight. His steps were measured. He did not look back.

Connor stood on the corner of Jalan Sultan Ismail and Jalan Bukit Bintang with the business card in one hand and his daypack over his shoulder and the city pressing around him -- the monorail, the traffic, the durian stall, the Pavilion's glass facade reflecting the sky, the hundred thousand lives moving through the intersection without pause, without looking, without knowing that a man was standing in the middle of them holding a narcotics officer's card and trying to decide what to feel.

---

He went to the Pavilion. He went to the hawker food court in the basement and ordered the Hokkien mee and sat at a plastic table under fluorescent lights and ate.

The Hokkien mee was good. Dark soy sauce, fat yellow noodles, prawns, pork belly, the wok hei -- the breath of the wok, the charred, smoky flavour that came from cooking over maximum heat with maximum skill. He ate it with a fork and spoon and looked at the business card propped against his water glass and thought about the word *narcotics*.

Sergeant Ahmad. Narcotics Division. Dang Wangi. He didn't know where Dang Wangi was. He didn't know what the Narcotics Division did beyond the obvious. He didn't know why Ahmad had singled him out at the checkpoint, though some part of him -- the shrinking, gasping part that still had access to reason -- suspected it was because Ahmad was good at his job and Connor was bad at hiding.

He thought about the body language Ahmad had described. *Your shoulders came up, and your pace changed, and your hand went to your bag.* The officer had read him like text. The officer had seen, in the two seconds between Connor noticing the checkpoint and Connor reaching the barrier, the physical signature of guilt. Not the guilt of a man carrying drugs today -- he wasn't carrying drugs today -- but the guilt of a man who carried them other days, the residual guilt that lived in the muscles and the posture and the involuntary responses of a body that had been trained by repetition to associate police with danger.

His body knew. That was the thing. His mind could produce any narrative it wanted -- phone components, import-export, logistics -- but his body had been keeping its own records, honest records, recording every delivery and every sports bag and every back-door drop-off, and when the police appeared, the body's records were the ones that played.

The Hokkien mee sat in his stomach. He pushed the plate away.

He looked at the business card again. SERGEANT AHMAD BIN ISMAIL. NARCOTICS DIVISION. The phone number. The email. The card was a lifeline, thrown across the water to a man who was drowning and didn't yet know he was drowning. All Connor had to do was call. He could call right now, from this plastic table, and say: *I've been carrying packages for a German man in a hostel in Chinatown and I don't know what's in them and I'm scared.* He could say that. He could say it and the phone call would change everything -- the packages would stop, the schedule would end, Felix would be investigated, and Connor would be a witness rather than a defendant, and the difference between witness and defendant was the difference between living and dying.

He picked up the card. Turned it over. The back was blank -- white cardstock, no text, no logo. He ran his thumb across the surface. The card was real. The offer was real. The lifeline was real.

He put the card in his wallet, behind a crumpled Malaysian banknote and a loyalty card for a Bali smoothie bar he'd never revisit. He put the wallet in his pocket. He finished his water. He left the food court and walked through the Pavilion's air-conditioned corridors and out into the heat and back toward Petaling Street and the hostel, and the card rode in his pocket like a small, white fact that he was not yet ready to use.

---

That night, on the rooftop, he told Felix about the checkpoint.

Not everything. Not Ahmad's card, not the Narcotics Division, not the body-language assessment. Just the checkpoint itself -- the cones, the barrier, the bag check.

"They're doing random checks in Bukit Bintang," he said, keeping his voice casual, the voice of a man reporting a traffic delay rather than a surveillance state. "Just thought you should know."

Felix was in his usual chair, beer in hand, the Petronas Towers behind him. He listened. His expression didn't change. When Connor finished, Felix nodded once.

"Good to know. Thanks." He drank. "Was it standard? Passport check, bag check?"

"Yeah. Routine."

"And you weren't carrying anything."

"No. Rest day."

"Good." Felix's voice was even, balanced, the voice of a man adjusting a variable in a spreadsheet. "These checkpoints rotate. They're usually in tourist areas -- Bukit Bintang, KLCC, sometimes Petaling Street. They're looking for pickpockets, illegal hawkers, overstayed visas. It's public relations as much as policing."

"Right. That's what I figured."

"The important thing," Felix said, "is that you weren't carrying anything. And on days when you are carrying something, we'll adjust the routes. Away from tourist areas, away from the obvious spots. I'll update the schedule."

He said it the way a project manager discusses logistical adjustments -- calmly, competently, without any acknowledgement that the "something" being discussed was the thing that could not be named, the thing in the packages, the thing that turned routes into risks and tourist areas into minefields. The normality of his tone was its own anaesthetic. Felix discussed the movement of illicit cargo through a Southeast Asian capital with the same vocal register he used to discuss restaurant recommendations, and the register said: *This is normal. This is business. This is fine.*

Connor drank his beer. The Petronas Towers watched. The city hummed. In his pocket, behind the crumpled banknote and the smoothie-bar loyalty card, Sergeant Ahmad's business card sat in the dark and waited to be relevant.

It would not be used. Connor would carry it for the rest of his time in KL -- through every delivery, every drop, every escalation. The card would ride in his wallet like a talisman, a physical manifestation of the help he could summon but never would, the exit he could take but never did. When his belongings were eventually catalogued at Dang Wangi police station, on the night he was arrested, an officer would find the card in his wallet and show it to Sergeant Ahmad, who would look at it and recognise it and say nothing, because there was nothing to say about a man who had been given a lifeline and had chosen to drown.

The rooftop was quiet. The beer was cold. Felix was talking about a restaurant in Bangsar that served the best rendang in the city, and Connor was listening, and the listening was easy, and the ease was the product.

---

Later -- past midnight, after Felix had gone to his room and the rooftop had emptied and the city's noise had settled into its nighttime register -- Connor sat on the zinc railing and did something he rarely did.

He thought about his father.

David Briggs, property developer, Hawthorn, Melbourne. A man of routines and certainties, of golf on Saturdays and now Tuesdays, of the morning Herald Sun and the evening news and the quiet, dependable architecture of a life built on work and family and the assumption that these things were enough. Connor had spent four years defining himself in opposition to his father -- the nomad against the suburbanite, the free spirit against the nine-to-five, the explorer against the man who hadn't left Australia since a honeymoon in Fiji in 1994.

But sitting on the railing with the Petronas Towers before him and Ahmad's card in his pocket, Connor thought about something his father had said to him at the airport when he'd left for Asia the first time. He'd been twenty-three. His father had driven him to Tullamarine, parked in the short-term lot, and walked him to the international departures gate with the particular gait of a man carrying something heavier than luggage.

At the gate, David had put his hand on Connor's shoulder. The hand was large, square, calloused from decades of site visits and handshakes. "Mate," he'd said, and the word *mate* from his father's mouth was different from the *mate* Connor used -- his father's *mate* was serious, connective, the word of a man who had limited vocabulary for love and used the words he had. "Mate, I need you to understand something. In other countries, the rules are different. Not worse, not better. Different. And the rules don't bend for you because you're Australian. The rules don't care who you are."

Connor had nodded. He'd been in a hurry -- the gate was closing, his backpack was heavy, his phone was dying. He'd said "Yeah, Dad, I know" with the breezy dismissiveness of a twenty-three-year-old who had never been in trouble and therefore assumed trouble was something that happened to other people.

His father's hand had stayed on his shoulder. "Connor. I'm serious. The rules don't care who you are."

He'd said it twice. Connor had heard it once. The second time had gone where all his father's repeated warnings went -- into the category of parental excess, of middle-aged caution, of the specific kind of fear that Connor believed was the defining limitation of people who stayed home.

Now, on a rooftop in Kuala Lumpur, three and a half years later, the second saying of the sentence arrived. It had been traveling a long time. It had crossed the distance from Tullamarine to Petaling Street at the speed of a lesson unlearned, and it arrived at the exact moment when it could do the most good and the least damage, which was also the moment when Connor was least likely to act on it.

*The rules don't care who you are.*

He finished his beer. He went downstairs. He climbed into Bed 7 and pulled the blue towel over his chest and lay in the dark with his father's voice in his head and Ahmad's card in his wallet and the city outside the air well breathing its hot, wet, indifferent breath.

He thought about calling his dad. Not to tell him about the packages -- he would never tell his father about the packages -- but just to hear the voice. The square, certain, Australian voice that said *mate* like it meant something and repeated warnings because repetition was the only tool a father had when his son was too far away to reach.

He didn't call. The time difference -- KL was two hours ahead of Melbourne -- made it ten PM in Hawthorn. His father would be watching the news, his mother reading in bed. A phone call at ten PM from KL would trigger the worry, the questions, the careful voice his mother used when she was trying not to sound scared. He couldn't do that to them. He couldn't call without reason, and the reason -- *Dad, I think I might be carrying drugs for a trafficker, there's a narcotics officer who gave me his card, a journalist has photos, a medical student printed the law, and a man at a bar told me his brother is on death row for the same thing I'm doing* -- was not a reason he could speak aloud, because speaking it would make it true, and truth was the one thing Connor Briggs could not afford.

So he lay in the dark. The ceiling fan turned. The phones sat on the mattress. The name waited on the bed frame. And somewhere in the building, in his private room on the third floor, Felix was updating a schedule, adjusting routes around a checkpoint that an Australian backpacker had helpfully reported, the way a well-trained courier reports obstacles to his handler, the way a tool reports its own wear to the mechanic who will continue using it until it breaks.

The city hummed. The building held. The night was warm and long and full of the kind of silence that wasn't silence at all but the sound of a machine running so smoothly you forgot it was there, producing its product hour after hour, the product being certainty, the certainty being false, the falseness being the only thing keeping the man in Bed 7 from the truth that was already forming in the dark like a storm, far away but approaching, inevitable, its thunder not yet audible but its pressure already changing the air.
# Chapter 16: Tomoko's Camera

Day 24 began with a delivery to Chow Kit that left a taste in Connor's mouth like copper.

Not literally -- the taste was metaphorical, the taste of something wrong, the lingering aftertaste of a morning that had been subtly different from every other morning. The difference was in the pickup. Felix had not been in his room when Connor knocked at nine. Instead, the door was ajar, a package on the desk -- sports bag, black nylon, zipped shut -- with a Post-it note in Felix's handwriting: *Chow Kit. Auntie Lim. Usual spot.*

Felix had never left a package unattended before. Felix had always been there for the handoff -- the eye contact, the brief instruction, the warmth that made the transaction feel like friendship rather than commerce. The empty room, the package on the desk, the Post-it note -- these were the mechanics of a different arrangement, an arrangement that no longer required the human element because the human element was already trained and the training was complete.

Connor took the package. Rode a Grab to Chow Kit. Walked through the morning market -- Chow Kit Market, the sprawling wet market where the smell of fresh fish and raw meat and the metallic tang of blood on butcher's blocks combined into something that was simultaneously repulsive and vital, the smell of a city feeding itself. Women in headscarves moved between stalls of vegetables and spices, their shopping bags swelling. Men carried crates of live chickens past bins of dried shrimp and towers of durian. The market was loud and close and alive in the way that only markets in this part of the world were alive -- every sense saturated, every surface wet, every voice raised.

He found Jalan Raja Bot 12. Knocked. Auntie Lim -- small, sixties, silver hair in a tight bun, her face a map of wrinkles that suggested she had been frowning professionally for decades -- took the bag through a door that opened onto a corridor that smelled of incense and chemical solvent. She closed the door without nodding. This was new. The nod had been part of the protocol -- the acknowledgement, the confirmation, the small human signal that the transaction was complete. Its absence left a gap, a silence where a signal should have been, and the gap was the thing that tasted like copper.

RM350. The money arrived. The money always arrived.

He went home. He showered. And at four in the afternoon, the photographs were on the common room table, arranged in a grid, and they were the most dangerous things in the building.

Tomoko had printed them at the same internet café Priya had used -- terminal four, the one by the window where the afternoon light hit the screen and made the images glow. She had uploaded sixteen photographs from the SD card of her Nikon D850, selected the eight most relevant, and printed them on the café's colour printer, which rendered them in the slightly oversaturated tones of cheap ink on cheap paper, the colours too vivid, the shadows too dark, the overall effect somewhere between documentary evidence and art.

She laid them on the coffee table in two rows of four. Each photograph was labelled on the back in her precise, small handwriting: date, time, location. She had been watching for weeks. The photographs were the harvest.

Connor came downstairs at four fifteen, freshly showered, his hair still wet, wearing a singlet that said WANDERLUST in a font designed in a factory in Shenzhen. He was heading for the door -- Grind Culture, the afternoon flat white, the performance of productivity that had become as much a part of his routine as the deliveries. He saw Tomoko sitting in the armchair. He saw the photographs on the table. He kept walking.

"Connor." Her voice was calm, level, carrying the weight of something rehearsed. "Sit down. Please."

"I'm heading out--"

"This will take five minutes."

He looked at her. She was wearing her usual uniform -- black T-shirt, cargo pants, the red-tipped hair pulled back. No camera today. The camera was in her room, its memory card backed up to a cloud server in Tokyo that Tomoko had configured with the paranoia of a journalist who had worked in Myanmar and learned that hardware was confiscatable but data was not.

Connor sat. Not because he wanted to but because the alternative -- walking past her, ignoring the photographs, performing the kind of aggressive avoidance that would confirm everything she suspected -- was worse than sitting.

"What are these?"

"Look at them."

He looked.

The first row:

**Photo 1.** Felix and Wei in Wei's phone repair shop. Night. The fluorescent light casting its blue-white pall through the glass. Felix's hands flat on the counter, leaning forward. Wei opposite. Between them, on the counter, a package -- brown paper, rectangular, taped shut. The same brown paper. The same tape. The same packages Connor had been carrying. Date: eleven days ago. Time: 11:47 PM.

**Photo 2.** A man Connor didn't recognise entering the hostel's alley entrance -- the back door, the one that led from the narrow lorong behind the building through a gate and into the ground floor's utility corridor. The man was carrying a large holdall. He was not a guest. The date was nine days ago. Time: 1:12 AM.

**Photo 3.** The same man leaving the hostel's alley entrance forty minutes later. No holdall. Time: 1:54 AM.

**Photo 4.** Felix on the rooftop, talking on his phone. His expression was the one Connor had seen through Wei's shop window that night -- flat, focused, emptied of charm. The Felix behind the mask. Date: six days ago. Time: 2:23 AM. Tomoko had been on the rooftop in the dark, camera in hand, her presence undetected because Tomoko moved through the world the way experienced journalists moved through the world -- silently, watchfully, with the patience of someone who understood that the truth was usually found in the spaces between noise.

The second row:

**Photo 5.** Wei's shop, daytime. Shot through the window at an angle. On the workbench behind the counter, visible among the phone screens and soldering equipment: a digital scale. The kind with a flat metal platform and an LCD readout. The kind used to weigh things in grams.

**Photo 6.** Felix entering a black sedan on Jalan Sultan. Night. The driver was visible through the windshield -- a man in his fifties, Chinese-Malaysian, wearing a dark polo shirt. The sedan's plates were partially visible. Felix was carrying a large backpack -- not his own, not the daypack he used daily, but a larger bag, full, the straps tight.

**Photo 7.** Connor. Walking down Petaling Street. Morning. Daypack on his shoulder, the bulge of a package visible through the nylon. His face in profile, caught mid-stride, his expression blank, emptied, the face of a man performing a task he has stopped thinking about. He looked, in the photograph, like a delivery driver. He looked like exactly what he was.

**Photo 8.** The hostel's entrance at night. The red lanterns glowing. And on the wall beside the door, barely visible in the low light, fresh graffiti that hadn't been there the week before. Two words, in black marker, in a hand that was neither artistic nor careless: @HOSTELREAPER. Beneath it, a small symbol -- a scythe, or an hourglass, or something in between.

Connor looked at the photographs. The photographs looked back.

They were clear. They were dated. They were the kind of evidence that a journalist assembled not for publication but for proof -- proof that a pattern existed, proof that the pattern was consistent, proof that the person denying the pattern was the person most deeply embedded in it.

"These don't prove anything," Connor said.

He said it automatically, the way the machine produced its output -- without deliberation, without pause, the defence emerging fully formed from the assembly line of denial. The sentence was in the air before he'd finished looking at the photographs, which meant the sentence was not a response to the photographs but a pre-loaded response to any evidence, any challenge, any information that threatened the structure.

Tomoko didn't argue. She picked up photograph number one -- Felix and Wei -- and held it up. "This is your friend Felix, at one in the morning, in a phone repair shop, with a package identical to the ones you carry. The shop is closed. The owner is not repairing phones. They are looking at a package on the counter. What do you think they're doing?"

"I don't know. Business meeting. Felix does import--"

"Import-export." Tomoko said the words the way you'd say the name of a disease you'd identified too many times. "Import-export is the cover story. It's the same cover story in every country I've worked in. In Myanmar, they said import-export. In Laos, they said import-export. In the Philippines, they said logistics consulting. The words change. The mechanism doesn't."

She picked up photograph seven. Connor. Walking. Carrying.

"This is you, Connor. This is what you look like from outside. You look like a courier. You look like a man carrying something he hasn't checked, to somewhere he doesn't question, for someone he doesn't know."

"I know Felix."

"You know what Felix shows you. I've been a journalist for seven years. I've covered drug networks in three countries. The person who recruits the mule is never the person the mule thinks they know. They're a performance. A mask. A character designed to produce trust."

Connor's jaw tightened. He could feel the anger building -- not the clean anger of being falsely accused but the hot, defensive anger of being accurately described. The anger that comes when someone points at the thing you've been hiding from yourself and gives it a name.

"You've been stalking me," he said. "You've been following me around the city taking photos of me without my permission."

"I've been documenting a trafficking operation that runs out of the building I sleep in. You happen to be part of it."

"I'm not part of anything--"

"You are. You just don't want to know what." She set the photograph down. "I'm not showing you these to accuse you. I'm showing you because I want you to see what I see. And what I see is a young man being used by a professional criminal, in a country where being used by a professional criminal gets you killed."

The common room was empty except for the two of them. The TV was off. The ceiling fans turned. Through the air well, the afternoon call to prayer began, the muezzin's voice rising from Masjid Jamek with the particular beauty that Islamic prayer possessed -- a beauty that existed regardless of whether the listener understood the words, a beauty that asked for nothing and offered everything.

Connor looked at the photographs. Photograph seven -- himself, walking, carrying -- was the one his eyes kept returning to. He looked at his own face in the image. The expression was blank. Not happy, not afraid, not aware. Blank. The face of a man on autopilot, executing a programme he hadn't written, moving through a city he didn't understand toward a destination he hadn't chosen.

He looked like a mule.

The word arrived and he couldn't deflect it this time. The photograph was too clear, the image too precise, the evidence too visual. In words, the accusation could be argued with. In photographs, the truth was flattened into two dimensions and made inescapable, the way a mirror is inescapable, the way your own face is inescapable when you're forced to look at it without the filter of your own narrative.

The moment lasted three seconds. In those three seconds, the machine stuttered. The gears slipped. The production line halted, and in the silence, the truth was briefly, painfully visible -- not as a thought but as a sensation, a full-body recognition that he was in danger, that the danger was real, that the photographs on the table were a map of his own destruction and the map was accurate and the destination was fixed.

Then the machine caught. The gears engaged. The production resumed.

"You don't know what you're talking about," Connor said. His voice was quiet now -- the anger had burned through its fuel and what remained was something harder, colder, the voice of a man building a wall brick by brick. "Felix is my friend. The packages are phone components. Your photos prove nothing except that you've been creeping around the hostel at night with a camera, which frankly is more suspicious than anything I've done."

Tomoko watched him. Her expression did not change. She had the stillness of a woman who had sat across from people in denial before -- in Yangon, in Vientiane, in Manila -- and had learned that the denial was not the obstacle. The denial was the symptom. The obstacle was the fear that the denial was protecting, and the fear could not be reached by argument because fear was not an argument. Fear was a wall. And walls could only be broken by what was on the other side, pressing outward, demanding space.

"I'm going to keep watching," she said. "I'm going to keep photographing. And when the time comes -- when the evidence is complete -- I'm going to take it to someone who can use it."

"Who? The police? Go ahead. Call the police. Tell them you've been stalking guests at a hostel with your camera. See how that goes."

"I wasn't thinking of the police." She gathered the photographs from the table, stacking them with the careful alignment of a person handling evidence. "I was thinking of someone at The Star. Or The Guardian. Or the Australian embassy."

She stood. The photographs disappeared into a manila envelope she'd been holding behind the armchair. The envelope went under her arm with the quiet efficiency of someone who knew the value of what she was carrying.

"Connor," she said. She stood over him, and for a moment, the journalist dropped away and what remained was a person -- a twenty-nine-year-old woman from Osaka who had seen too much of the world's cruelty and could not stop trying to prevent it, even when the people she was trying to save were the ones fighting hardest to stay in danger.

"I like you," she said. "You're funny and you're kind, when you're not being a fool. But you are being a fool. And if you don't stop, what happens next will not be funny and it will not be kind, and there will be no photograph that can help you."

She left. Her door on the third floor opened and closed.

---

Connor sat in the common room alone. The coffee table was empty. The photographs were gone. But their afterimages remained -- burned into his retinas, the way bright lights left shadows when you closed your eyes. Felix and Wei. The midnight visitor. The digital scale. Himself, carrying, blank-faced, a courier in profile.

He sat for fifteen minutes without moving. Through the air well, the afternoon call to prayer ended, the muezzin's voice descending to silence, and in the silence the hostel breathed and the hostel remembered and the hostel waited with the patience of something that had been waiting for a very long time.

Then he stood. He went to the staircase. He climbed to the third floor, past the Japanese characters, past the blue tiles, to Felix's door.

He knocked.

Felix opened. The smile appeared -- warm, generous, the Felix that Connor knew and needed.

"Hey, mate. What's up?"

"Tomoko," Connor said. "She's been taking photos. Of you, of me, of the deliveries. She has pictures of us at Wei's shop, pictures of the packages, pictures of me carrying. She says she's going to take them to someone."

He said it the way a soldier reports enemy positions -- factual, urgent, loyal. He was reporting the threat to his commander. He was protecting the operation. He was choosing, in this moment, the side he had chosen since the first envelope, the side of easy money and warm friendship and the comfortable lie, and the choosing was so natural that it didn't feel like choosing at all. It felt like reflex. It felt like gravity. It felt like the ground.

Felix's expression changed. The smile didn't vanish -- it altered, reconfiguring into something thinner, more focused, the smile of a man who has received tactical intelligence and is already processing countermeasures. His eyes moved to a place Connor couldn't see -- the space behind the eyes where calculations happened, where variables were adjusted and risks were assessed and expendable elements were identified.

"How many photos?" Felix's voice was calm. The German accent was slightly more pronounced, the precision of the consonants sharpening, the way they did when Felix was working.

"Eight. Printed. She said she has more on her camera."

"Where does she keep the camera?"

"Her room, I think. Dorm 5."

Felix nodded. The nod was slow, deliberate, the nod of a man adding an item to a list. "Don't worry about Tomoko," he said. "I'll handle it."

"What does that mean?"

"It means I'll talk to her. Journalist to photographer. Professional courtesy." The smile returned, fuller now, warmer, the mask repaired, the surface restored. "She's just being thorough. It's what journalists do. I respect it. But she doesn't have the full picture, and once I explain the business properly, she'll understand."

Connor nodded. The nodding was easy. Nodding was what he did when Felix spoke, the physical affirmation that the words were landing, that the explanation was sufficient, that the world Felix described was the world they lived in.

"Thanks, mate," Connor said. "Sorry for the--"

"No need to apologise. You did the right thing, telling me."

"Of course. We're a team."

The word *team* sat between them -- a word that Connor believed and Felix used, the way a carpenter uses a hammer: to drive things into place. Felix clapped Connor on the shoulder. The hand was warm. The gesture was intimate. The intimacy was engineered.

"Go have your coffee," Felix said. "I'll sort this out."

Connor left. He went to Grind Culture. He ordered his flat white. He sat at his window table and posted a sunset photo for Pacific Soul and felt the relief of a man who has passed a problem to someone competent, the way you feel when the mechanic says "I'll fix it" and you believe him because believing him is easier than understanding the engine.

He did not think about what "I'll handle it" meant. He did not think about why Felix had asked where Tomoko kept her camera. He did not think about the word *handle* and its implications, or the look in Felix's eyes when Connor had said *Dorm 5*, or the slow nod that had added something to a list Connor could not see.

The flat white was good. The Wi-Fi was strong. The afternoon passed.

---

Three days later, Tomoko's camera was gone.

She reported it to Mei Ling at reception. Her room had been entered while she was out -- no sign of forced entry, but the Nikon D850 was missing from its case. The SD cards, two of them, were also gone. Her laptop was untouched. Her money was untouched. Only the camera and the cards.

Mei Ling documented the theft in the guest complaint ledger. She offered to call the police. Tomoko declined. She knew who had taken the camera. She knew why. And she knew that calling the police would alert the people she was trying to document, which would make the documentation impossible, which was the entire point of the theft.

Tomoko stood at the reception counter, her expression flat, her fists clenched at her sides. She looked at the common room where Connor was sitting on the sofa, scrolling his phone, performing ignorance with the fluency of a native speaker.

"You told him," she said, across the room, her voice carrying the cold, precise weight of someone stating a fact.

Connor looked up. "What?"

"You told Felix about the photographs. And now my camera is gone."

"I didn't--"

"Don't." The word was a door slamming. "Don't lie to me. You told him, and he sent someone to take my camera, and now the evidence is gone, and you did this. You did this because you chose him over the truth."

The common room was not empty. Two Dutch backpackers were playing cards at the far table. They looked up, looked at Tomoko, looked at Connor, and performed the universal backpacker response to interpersonal conflict: they put their heads down and pretended the room contained only them and the cards.

Connor opened his mouth. The machine tried to produce a defence but the machine had been running hard for weeks and the gears were grinding and what came out was not a defence but a silence, and the silence was the most honest thing he'd said in a month.

Tomoko looked at him. The look lasted five seconds. In those five seconds, something ended -- the last residual goodwill, the last trace of the concern that had motivated her to show him the photographs, the last molecular bond of human care that had connected a Japanese journalist to an Australian courier across a coffee table in a hostel in Chinatown.

"I backed up the photos," she said. "Cloud storage. You can steal a camera but you can't steal a cloud." She paused. "When this ends -- and it will end, Connor, the same way it always ends -- remember that I tried. Remember that we all tried."

She climbed the staircase. Her footsteps continued to the third floor. Her door opened and closed with a sound that was final in a way that transcended the mechanics of hinges and frames. It was the sound of a witness deciding that the witness phase was over, and the next phase was coming, and the next phase would involve not a camera but a keyboard, and not photographs but words, and the words would be published, and the published words would outlast the camera and the photographs and the evidence and the man who had caused them to be stolen.

Connor sat on the sofa. The Dutch backpackers played cards.

---

That evening, Priya found him on the rooftop.

He was sitting in the dark, no beer this time, just the plastic chair and the humid air and the Petronas Towers doing their permanent silver performance against the night sky. He wasn't looking at his phone. He wasn't doing anything. He was sitting absolutely still, hands on his knees, staring at nothing, waiting for the numbness to wear off and the feeling to arrive.

Priya sat in the chair beside him. She didn't speak immediately. She let the silence hold, the way she did when she was being a doctor rather than a girlfriend, giving the patient space to arrive at the conversation in their own time.

"Tomoko told me about the camera," she said, eventually.

"Yeah."

"You told Felix about her photographs."

"I told him because she was going to make trouble. She was going to go to the papers, the embassy, the -- I was protecting--"

"You were protecting Felix."

The sentence was accurate and it cut. Connor felt it land below the numbness, in the place where the things he didn't want to know lived.

"I was protecting myself," he said. "If those photos went public -- if she went to the Australian embassy and said I was doing deliveries for someone -- that's my reputation. That's my travel life. That's everything."

"That's your concern? Your *reputation*?"

"Don't do that. Don't make it sound stupid."

"It is stupid, Connor. Your reputation is not the thing at risk here. Your *life* is the thing at risk. Tomoko wasn't going to the embassy to embarrass you. She was going because she thought it might save you. And instead of letting her try, you went to Felix and handed him the information he needed to shut her down."

Connor opened his mouth. The machine tried to engage. But the machine was exhausted -- weeks of continuous operation, the gears worn, the belts stretched, the motor overheating. What came out was not a defence but a sound, a small exhalation, the sound of something deflating.

"I know," he said.

The words surprised him. They surprised Priya too -- he could feel her posture shift, the slight forward lean of someone who has been pushing against a door and felt it give.

"You know what?"

"I know I shouldn't have told him. I know the camera -- I know that was because of me." He rubbed his face with both hands. The stubble scraped his palms. "I just -- Priya, I don't know how to stop. I'm in it now. The schedule, the money, the people who take the packages. They know my face. They know where I live. If I stop, Felix will -- I don't know what Felix will do."

It was the most honest thing he had said since arriving in KL. The words came from beneath the machine, from the dark space where the truth lived, the space that the rationalisations were designed to keep sealed. The truth was simple and enormous: he was afraid. Not of the law, not of the police, not even of the death penalty. He was afraid of Felix. He was afraid of what Felix represented -- the infrastructure, the network, the system that had absorbed him so completely that extraction felt impossible.

Priya reached for his hand. He let her take it. Her fingers were cool, the jade bracelet sliding against his wrist.

"You can stop," she said. "Right now. Tonight. You can go to Sergeant Ahmad -- you told me about the card, Connor, I know you have it -- and you can tell him everything. What you've carried, where you've taken it, who gave it to you. They'll protect you. You'll be a witness, not a defendant."

"And Felix?"

"Felix will be arrested. Or he'll run. Either way, he won't be your problem anymore."

"He'll know it was me. The network -- they'll know I talked."

"The network is already watching you. Tomoko's photos prove that. The man who comes at one AM with a holdall? He's not delivering phone accessories, Connor. He's a supplier. And suppliers know their couriers. If you don't stop, the only question is whether you get caught by the police first or used up by the network first, and I don't know which outcome is worse."

The Petronas Towers glowed. The city hummed. A plane descended toward KLIA, its lights blinking, carrying someone new toward a city that was simultaneously beautiful and lethal, the way all beautiful things were lethal when you mistook the surface for the substance.

"I'll think about it," Connor said.

"Don't think about it. Do it."

"I'll think about it."

Priya held his hand. She held it the way you hold something you know you're about to lose -- tightly, completely, with every finger and every gram of pressure, as though the holding itself could prevent the letting go.

"I love you," she said. She hadn't said it before. The words arrived in the space between them with the weight of something that had been carried a long time and was being set down, carefully, in the dark. "I love you and I'm terrified. And if you don't stop, I'm going to have to watch something happen to you that I can't prevent, and that will break me, Connor. Not in the way heartbreak usually works -- in the way that bone breaks. The way that things break when they can't bend anymore."

He turned to her. In the dark, her face was visible only by the city's ambient light -- the round glasses reflecting orange, her eyes dark and steady, her expression carrying the weight of everything she'd tried to tell him and everything he'd refused to hear.

"I love you too," he said, and he meant it, and the meaning was the truest thing in his life, and the truest thing in his life was not enough to save him.

They sat on the rooftop. They held hands. The night passed. Neither of them mentioned the photographs, or the camera, or the printed law, or the business card in Connor's wallet. They sat in the dark and held onto each other and the holding was the only thing either of them had, the only thing that didn't require a decision or an action or a confrontation with the truth, the only thing that was simply human and simply real in a situation that had become neither.

The building breathed. The fans turned. And in her room on the third floor, Tomoko Sato sat at a desk with her laptop open, composing an email to a contact at The Star newspaper, attaching files from a cloud server in Tokyo, writing in English that was precise and economical and contained no adjectives that weren't necessary, the way she wrote everything, the way a scalpel contains no metal that isn't necessary.

The subject line read: *Drug trafficking operation -- Petaling Street hostel -- evidence attached.*

She read it once. She read it twice.

She did not press send. Not yet. The evidence wasn't complete. The camera was gone but the cloud wasn't, and the cloud contained sixteen photographs, and the photographs contained a story, and the story was still being written by a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in a WANDERLUST singlet who was sitting on a rooftop holding hands with a woman who had tried to save him and failing, night by night, delivery by delivery, to save himself.
# Chapter 17: Easy Money

Days 25 through 30 passed the way water passes over a stone -- continuously, invisibly, wearing everything smooth.

---

**Day 25. Monday. Jalan Ipoh.**

Package: sports bag, black nylon, 3.2 kilograms. Pickup from Felix's room, 9:00 AM. Delivery to Mr. Tan, 9:47 AM. Mr. Tan took the bag, inspected the contents behind a partially closed roller door, nodded. RM350. Grab home. Total time: one hour twelve minutes.

Connor spent the afternoon at Grind Culture. Flat white, RM14. Scheduled three posts for Pacific Soul Retreats. Received a DM from a boutique resort in Lombok asking about social media management: 500K IDR per month, which was approximately RM150, which was less than one delivery. He replied with his rate card -- the one he'd made in Canva six months ago that listed his services at prices no one had ever paid -- and never heard back.

Bank balance: RM11,830.

He bought Priya dinner at a Korean restaurant in Bukit Bintang. Spicy tofu stew, fried chicken, three side dishes. She ate quietly. The conversation was careful -- they talked about her medical studies, about the neurology rotation she was dreading, about the difference between the NHS and the Malaysian health system. They did not talk about packages or photographs or the law. The not-talking was a new feature of their relationship, a room they'd built together and agreed not to enter, and the room grew larger every day.

---

**Day 26. Tuesday. Brickfields.**

Package: brown paper, taped shut, 1.8 kilograms. Lighter than usual. The lightness produced a brief, irrational relief -- as though the weight of the package correlated with the weight of the crime, as though carrying something light was less illegal than carrying something heavy. This was not how the law worked. The law did not care about kilograms. The law cared about grams -- fifty of them -- and the law did not weigh the package. The law weighed the contents.

Connor delivered to the Blue Door. The woman in the green salwar kameez took the package, closed the door, and the door's colour -- that faded, institutional blue -- stayed in his mind for the rest of the day, the way certain colours stay after you close your eyes, an afterimage that was not visual but emotional.

Afternoon: he walked through Brickfields back to the hostel instead of taking a Grab. Little India unfolded around him -- the garland shops and textile stores and the banana leaf restaurants where lunch was served on actual banana leaves, the rice and curries arranged in a pattern that was both aesthetic and practical, the leaf's natural coating preventing the food from sticking, the eating done with the right hand, the leaf folded toward you when you were done to signal satisfaction.

He stopped at a temple. Sri Mahamariamman, the oldest Hindu temple in KL, its tower rising from the street in a riot of painted gods and goddesses, each figure expressing an emotion Connor couldn't name, each colour -- red, green, gold, blue, purple -- saturated beyond reality into the territory of the divine. He stood at the entrance and looked up and felt, for a moment, the specific smallness that comes from standing before something that was ancient when your country was not yet a country. The temple had been here since 1873. It would be here long after Connor was gone.

He photographed it. He captioned it: *When the universe is bigger than your plans.* Twelve hashtags. Thirty-one likes.

Bank balance: RM12,180.

---

**Day 27. Wednesday. Rest day.**

He slept until eleven. Ate Mama Siti's nasi lemak. Sat on the rooftop in the morning heat and did nothing.

The doing-nothing was different now. Previously, Connor's rest days had been genuinely restful -- the absence of deliveries creating a lightness, a freedom, the day stretching open like a hand unclenching. Now the rest days were the days when the machine ran hardest, because the machine had nothing to process except itself, and the self it was processing was increasingly difficult to maintain.

He thought about Priya. She was leaving in twelve days. Her six-week break was half over, and the return flight to London was booked and paid for, and the final-year placements were waiting, and the life she'd built -- the real life, the life with structure and purpose and a future -- was pulling her back with a gravity that Connor's world could not match.

He thought about Jake. Jake was still in KL -- Langkawi had been postponed because Jake had met an Italian girl named Chiara who worked at a bar on Changkat and Jake had decided, with the confident romanticism of a man whose decisions were made entirely by his limbic system, that Chiara was "the one." The one lasted approximately five days before Chiara left for Penang, but the postponement meant Jake was still here, still a presence, still the golden retriever in board shorts whose function in Connor's life was to be the friend who didn't question, didn't push, didn't see beneath the surface.

He thought about the money. RM12,180. *She'll be right.* The phrase arrived the way it always did -- automatic, reflexive, the Australian mantra that had carried him through twelve countries. But the phrase was beginning to sound, even to him, like something a man said when he was falling and couldn't reach the railing. He'd never had this much money in his life. The number sat in his banking app like a small monument, a stack of ringgit that represented four weeks of packages and sports bags and brown paper and blue doors and men who didn't make eye contact. The money was clean in his account and dirty in its origin and the difference between clean and dirty was a question Connor had stopped asking because asking was the first step on a road he couldn't afford to walk.

He went to the cinema. Pavilion KL, the mall in Bukit Bintang, where the multiplex had leather seats and air conditioning cold enough to make him shiver. He watched a Marvel film -- he couldn't remember which one by the end, they were all the same film now, the same indestructible heroes fighting the same impossible odds with the same outcome, the good guys winning, the bad guys losing, the universe restored. He ate popcorn and drank a Coke and sat in the dark and felt the comfort of clean rules and just consequences and nobody dying who didn't deserve to.

Bank balance: unchanged. RM12,180. The money sat there. The money waited.

---

**Day 28. Thursday. Chow Kit.**

The delivery to Auntie Lim was routine. Sports bag, 2.6 kilograms, taxi, drop, transfer. RM350. The wet market was in full morning cry -- fish sellers hawking in Malay and Cantonese, the ice on the tables melting in the heat, the smell of the sea competing with the smell of raw poultry and the sulfurous funk of the storm drains, the same rotten-egg stench that had hit Connor on his first night in Chinatown and that he'd stopped noticing weeks ago.

But something happened on the way back that Connor would not think about until much later.

He was walking through the market, past the stalls, past the vendors, past the displays of tropical fruit stacked in pyramids -- rambutans red and hairy, mangosteens purple and smooth, dragonfruit pink and alien. A woman bumped his shoulder. She was Malay, middle-aged, carrying a shopping bag in each hand, and the bump was accidental -- the crowded market, the narrow aisles, the inevitable physics of too many people in too small a space.

"Sorry, sorry," she said, in English, and then looked at his face and stopped.

She looked at him the way Mama Siti looked at him. The way Razak had looked at him in the office with the map. The way Mei Ling had looked at him at the reception counter. The way people looked at a person when they knew something about that person that the person didn't know about themselves.

"You're from the hostel," she said. "Petaling Street."

"Yeah, I--"

"I see you. Every Thursday. Walking through here with the bag." She shifted her shopping bags from one hand to the other, the gesture of a woman redistributing weight. "My stall is there." She pointed to a vegetable stall three metres away. "I sell kangkung and okra and I see everything from my stall."

Connor said nothing.

"Be careful, boy." She said *boy* the way Malaysian aunties said *boy* -- not as a diminutive but as a term of address that simultaneously acknowledged your existence and implied your stupidity. "The police come through here too. They see the same things I see."

She walked away. Her shopping bags swung at her sides. She didn't look back.

Connor stood in the market. The fruit pyramids rose around him. The vendors called. The ice melted. And the woman's words settled into him like rain into soil, reaching a depth that the surface warnings -- Priya's arguments, Tomoko's photos, Mei Ling's instruction -- had not reached, because this was not a warning from a friend or a journalist or a receptionist. This was a warning from a stranger. A vegetable seller. A woman who had no investment in Connor's survival except the basic, unremarkable human impulse to tell a person they are walking into traffic.

He went home. He didn't tell Felix about the woman. He wasn't sure why. Maybe it was because telling Felix about the checkpoint had led to the checkpoint being avoided, and telling Felix about Tomoko had led to the camera being stolen, and telling Felix about this woman would lead to -- what? What could Felix do about a vegetable seller in Chow Kit who had eyes?

He ate lunch. He met Jake for beers. He went to bed.

Bank balance: RM12,530.

**Day 29. Friday. Jalan Ipoh.**

Return leg. Mr. Tan. RM350. The delivery was unremarkable. The delivery was always unremarkable. That was the point.

Connor spent the afternoon with Jake at the Petronas Towers -- the skybridge tour, which Connor had been meaning to do since he arrived and hadn't because doing tourist things felt like regression, like admitting he was a tourist rather than a resident, a visitor rather than a local. But Jake wanted to go and Connor wanted to not think, and the Petronas Towers delivered on both counts: the skybridge was forty-one floors up, the city spread below like a circuitboard, the buildings and roads and parks and mosques miniaturised by distance into something comprehensible, something you could hold in your eye and know.

From the skybridge, you could see everything. Petaling Street, a sliver of red and gold in the urban grid. Bukit Bintang, its malls glinting. Chow Kit, a dense cluster of low-rise rooftops. Brickfields, identifiable by the temple towers. The North-South Expressway, a grey ribbon heading north toward Penang. The LRT lines, silver threads connecting the city's parts. And in the distance, green hills, and beyond the hills, more hills, and beyond those, the edge of the Malaysian peninsula, where the land ended and the sea began and the rest of the world waited.

"Dude," Jake said, pressing his forehead against the glass. "This is insane."

"Yeah."

"Like, we're literally standing between the tallest twin towers in the world. How is this our life?"

"It's pretty sick."

Jake took seventeen selfies. Connor took three. In one of them, looking at it later, he noticed his own reflection in the glass -- a figure standing against the city's grid, transparent, ghostlike, as though the city was already showing through him, as though he was already becoming less solid, less present, less there.

He posted the photo. Caption: *Standing on top of the world. KL, you absolute legend.* Forty-three likes.

Bank balance: RM12,880.

**Day 30. Saturday. Bukit Bintang.**

The drop to Danny at Lot 22B was the last of the week. Sports bag, heavier than usual, 4.1 kilograms. Danny was young -- mid-twenties, Chinese-Malaysian, thin, with the nervous energy of a person who was not at the top of any chain but was somewhere in the middle, the disposable middle, the part that could be replaced without the machine noticing.

Danny took the bag through a door in the back of a building that, from the front, looked like a defunct karaoke bar -- the sign still up, the neon tubes dark, the windows papered over. The interior, glimpsed briefly as Danny pulled the door open, was not a karaoke bar. It was a room with a table and scales and bags and the smell of something chemical that Connor's nose registered and his brain rejected.

The door closed. RM400. Higher than the others. Saturday deliveries paid more. Connor did not ask why.

He walked through Bukit Bintang in the late afternoon sun, the pavement crowded with Saturday shoppers, the monorail humming overhead, the durian stall pumping its signature aroma into the air. He felt the RM400 arrive in his account with the small, warm pulse of validation that each transfer produced, the Pavlovian response that the schedule had built into his nervous system -- delivery, transfer, dopamine. The cycle was complete. The cycle was repeating. The cycle was all there was.

Bank balance: RM13,280.

---

On Sunday, rest day, Connor sat on his bunk and opened the banking app and looked at the number and felt something he had never felt before.

The feeling was not happiness. Happiness was what he told himself it was -- the satisfaction of accumulation, the security of surplus, the quiet triumph of a man who was making it work. But beneath the happiness, beneath the number, beneath the green bar graph that showed his balance climbing week over week in a line that looked like success, there was something else.

The something else was this: the number was not a number. The number was a weight. Each ringgit was a gram. Each transfer was a delivery. Each delivery was a package he'd never opened, a bag he'd never checked, a sports-bag-sized piece of the unknown carried across a city that would kill him for carrying it. The balance in his account was an inventory of risk, denominated in currency, and the inventory was growing, and the risk was growing with it, and the growth was silent and smooth and invisible the way all growth was when you weren't looking.

RM13,280. In thirty days. For carrying things.

---

**Day 31. Monday.**

Jalan Ipoh. Mr. Tan. RM350. The routine.

Something happened on the way home that was not part of the routine.

The Grab dropped Connor on Jalan Sultan, two blocks from the hostel, because a food delivery truck was blocking the lane and the driver refused to navigate around it with the particular stubbornness of a KL Grab driver encountering a situation that required effort. Connor walked. The midday sun was a white disc in a white sky, the heat landing on exposed skin like a physical weight, the humidity turning every breath into something that had to be earned.

He passed the Guan Di Temple. The red doors were open, the interior visible -- the altar, the smoke, the golden statue of the Chinese god of war sitting in his niche with the calm authority of someone who had been settling disputes for two thousand years. An old man knelt at the altar, burning joss paper, the flames leaping and dying in the still air. The smoke rose straight up, undisturbed.

Connor paused. He'd passed the temple every day for a month and had never gone inside. Today, he stepped through the door.

The interior was cool -- not air-conditioned cool but the stone-and-shade cool of a building designed for a tropical climate, the thick walls absorbing the heat and releasing it slowly, the open doorway creating a draft that moved the incense smoke in lazy spirals. The smell was intense: sandalwood incense, burning paper, the waxy fragrance of red candles, and beneath it all, the dusty sweetness of old wood and old gold.

He stood in the middle of the temple and felt something shift. Not a thought -- a sensation. The sensation of being very small in a very old place, the same feeling he'd had at the Hindu temple in Brickfields, the same feeling that religious architecture was designed to produce: the dissolution of the ego, the reminder that the self was temporary and the building was not.

He looked at the altar. Guan Di sat in gold, his beard flowing, his halberd beside him, his expression carrying the particular serenity of a deity who had seen everything human beings could do to each other and had decided to help anyway.

Connor didn't pray. He didn't know how to pray, and if he had known, he wouldn't have known what to pray for, because the thing he needed was not divine intervention but the human courage to stop doing what he was doing, and courage was not something you could request from a statue, however gold, however serene.

But he stood there. For three minutes, in the cool and the smoke, he stood and felt the smallness and let it hold him. Then he left. The heat hit him at the door. The city resumed. He walked home with the feeling fading and by the time he reached the hostel it was gone, replaced by the afternoon routine, the scrolling, the performing, the slow, warm erosion of everything that was not the machine.

---

**Day 32. Tuesday.**

Brickfields. Blue Door. RM350. Routine.

In the evening, he received an email from his sister.

Megan Briggs, senior analyst, accounting firm, Sydney. The email was brief, as Megan's communications always were -- she wrote the way she lived, efficiently, without excess, each sentence carrying exactly the information it needed and not a syllable more.

> Connor,
>
> Mum told me you're staying in Malaysia for a while. She's worried. She's always worried about you but she's more worried than usual, which means something is different, even if she can't say what.
>
> I'm not going to lecture you. You're 27 and you've been doing this for four years and nothing I say will change your mind. But I want you to know that Dad is not well. He hasn't told you because he doesn't want you to come home out of guilt. He has high blood pressure and his doctor has put him on medication and reduced his golf to once a week, which is making him miserable.
>
> I'm telling you this not to make you feel bad but because I think you should know. And because I think, at some point, you might want to consider that the people who love you are getting older, and the time you have with them is not unlimited, and spending it on the other side of the world carrying a phone you never answer is a choice that has consequences for more people than just you.
>
> That's all. Take care of yourself.
>
> Megan

Connor read the email three times. The words were sharp -- Megan's words were always sharp, honed by years of numbers and reports and a lifetime of saying difficult things concisely so the numbers did the feeling for her. But the sharpness was a surface; beneath it, in the spaces between the sentences, was something softer. Something that sounded like: *I'm your sister and I love you and I'm scared and I don't know how to say it because we've never been good at saying it.*

His father. High blood pressure. Medication. Golf reduced. The images arrived: David Briggs, sixty-one, square-shouldered, the property developer who'd built half of Hawthorn's new townhouses, reduced to a pill organiser and a doctor's caution. His father, who never complained, who never showed weakness, who'd driven Connor to the airport and said *the rules don't care who you are* and meant it and been right.

Connor typed a reply:

> Thanks for telling me, Megs. Tell Dad I'll call him this week. And tell Mum not to worry.

He sent it. He put down the phone. He stared at the wall of the common room -- the bookshelf, the TV, the red lanterns -- and thought about consequences, and time, and the brutal arithmetic: earning RM13,000 in a country that would kill him while his father was taking medication in a country where he could have been safe.

The image came without permission: David Briggs at the kitchen table in Hawthorn, the pill organiser open in front of him -- one of those plastic trays with the days of the week printed on each compartment, the kind of object that belonged in the homes of the very old, not in the hands of a sixty-one-year-old property developer who had built half a suburb with those hands. His father's hands. The hands that had poured foundations and signed contracts and gripped Connor's shoulder at the airport and held on for a beat longer than the protocol allowed. Those hands, now sorting pills. Monday through Sunday. The small, coloured capsules that were keeping his blood from doing what blood, left to its own devices, apparently wanted to do -- which was to press against the walls of the vessels that carried it with a force that could kill the man who carried them.

Connor did the arithmetic. He couldn't help it. The arithmetic was reflexive, the way flinching was reflexive, a thing the body did before the mind could intervene. His father was sixty-one. The life expectancy for an Australian male was eighty-two. That was twenty-one years. Twenty-one years of pills and reduced golf and his mother watching his father's face for the signs of something worse. Twenty-one years was seven thousand, six hundred and sixty-five days. Connor had been in KL for thirty-two of them. Thirty-two days of packages and sports bags and blue doors, during which his father's blood pressure had been doing its quiet, domestic violence, and Connor had not called, had not come home, had not been there for any of it, because being there would have required being someone who did not carry things through Chow Kit for money.

He could call now. He could pick up the phone and dial the Melbourne number and say the words: *I'm coming home, Dad. I'll be on the next flight.* He could feel the words forming -- the shape of them in his mouth, the weight of them in his chest, the specific, physical relief they would produce, the way setting down a heavy bag produces relief, the sudden lightness of a body freed from cargo. He reached for the phone. His hand moved. And the machine intercepted it -- not with logic, not with argument, but with the blank, smooth refusal of a system that had learned to redirect impulse before it became action. The phone stayed on the table. The call was not made. The words dissolved back into the silence they had come from, and in their place the machine substituted the familiar calculation: the RM13,280 in the account, the schedule that continued, the packages that needed carrying, the steady accumulation that felt, from inside the machine, like purpose.

He picked up the phone. He opened the banking app instead. The green bar graph climbed. The number sat. And the email from Megan -- the email with its sharp sentences and its soft centre, the email that weighed nothing in megabytes and everything in grams -- joined the list of things Connor had received and registered and filed in the part of his mind where warnings went to be acknowledged and then, systematically, ignored.

---

---

**Day 33. Wednesday. Rest day.**

He called his father.

David Briggs picked up on the fourth ring, which was unusual -- David Briggs picked up on the first ring, always had, the reflexive grab of a man who'd spent thirty years taking calls from site managers and councils and lawyers. The fourth ring meant he'd been looking for the phone, or hesitating, or both.

"Connor." The voice was the same -- square, solid, Australian in the way that eucalyptus trees were Australian, deeply rooted and slightly weathered. "How are you, mate?"

"I'm good, Dad. How are you?"

"Can't complain. Well, I can, but your mother tells me nobody wants to hear it." A chuckle. The chuckle was the same too -- dry, brief, the humour of a man who rationed his laughter the way he rationed his affection, not because he lacked it but because he believed economy was a virtue.

They talked for twelve minutes. Connor learned that his father's blood pressure was "under control" (David's term), that the medication was "a nuisance" (David's term for anything that reminded him of mortality), and that golf once a week was "criminal" (David's term for anything that prevented him from playing golf). They talked about the Melbourne property market, which David tracked the way astronomers tracked the stars -- with precision, with passion, with the conviction that the patterns meant something. They talked about Megan's promotion. They talked about the dog, a labrador named Bruce, who had developed a limp.

They did not talk about Connor's life. This was the protocol: David asked "How are you?", Connor said "Good," and the subject was closed. David did not ask what Connor did for money, where he slept, who his friends were, or when he was coming home. These questions lived in the space between father and son like furniture in a dark room -- present, immovable, navigated by memory.

At the eleven-minute mark, David said: "Your mother tells me you've been in KL a while now. She says you might stay longer."

"Yeah. Thinking about it."

"Right." A pause. The pause was David's version of a paragraph break, a space in which unspoken things accumulated. "Just -- look after yourself, Connor. That's all."

"I will, Dad."

"I know you will. You're a sensible bloke." He said it without irony, which was worse than irony, because irony would have acknowledged the gap between the statement and the reality, and the absence of irony meant David believed it, the way parents believe things about their children that the children have long since disproven.

"Love you, Dad."

"Love you too, mate. Call your mother. She misses you."

The call ended. Connor sat on the rooftop with the phone in his hand and the Petronas Towers in his eyes and the word *sensible* in his ears and the word was wrong, the word was the wrongest word in the English language applied to the most wrong person in the most wrong situation, and the wrongness hurt in a way that the warnings hadn't, because the warnings came from people who saw the truth and the word *sensible* came from a man who loved the lie, and the lie was the only thing Connor had given his father in four years.

---

**Day 34. Thursday.**

Chow Kit. Auntie Lim. RM350.

The vegetable seller was at her stall. She saw him. She didn't speak. She didn't need to. Her eyes tracked him as he walked through the market with the sports bag, and her expression -- the same expression from last week, the expression of a woman who sees a boy walking toward something that will hurt him -- was the speech. The silence was louder than the words.

Connor walked faster. He delivered the package. He went home.

That evening, Tomoko was at the reception counter when he came down for dinner. She had a new camera -- smaller, cheaper, a Fujifilm compact that looked like a downgrade from the Nikon the way a car looked like a downgrade from an airplane. But it was a camera, and it had a lens, and the lens was pointed at nothing in particular, but its presence was a statement.

*I'm still watching. The camera was stolen but the watcher was not. You can take the tool but you can't take the eye.*

She didn't look at Connor. She didn't need to. The camera was the communication. The camera said: *I have a cloud. I have contacts. I have patience. And I am not done.*

Connor went to dinner. He ate roti canai at the mamak stall and watched the evening traffic on Jalan Sultan and thought about cameras and clouds and women from Osaka who didn't give up and wondered, briefly, whether not giving up was a form of kindness or a form of cruelty, and decided it was both, the way most true things were both.

---

He closed the app. He opened Instagram. He posted a photo of the Petronas Towers at sunset -- the one Jake had taken, the one where the light turned the silver cladding to gold. Caption: *Living the dream. No alarm clock. No boss. Just sunsets and good vibes.* Twenty-two hashtags.

Sixty-one likes.

The likes were the smallest number he cared about and the largest number anyone would see. The bank balance was the largest number he cared about and the number no one would see. Between the two numbers -- between the public metric of a curated life and the private metric of an illegal one -- Connor Briggs existed, a man with two phones and two identities and two accounts, one that counted followers and one that counted ringgit, and both of them were lies and both of them were true and the difference between the lies and the truth was a question he would never ask because asking was the thing that would end everything.

He put down the phone. Both phones. He lay on Bed 7 and listened to the building settle around him -- the pipes ticking, the wood groaning in the heat, the slow respiration of a structure that had been breathing since 1928 and would keep breathing long after the man on the mattress stopped. The ceiling fan turned above him. *Tick, tick, tick.* He thought: *I should stop.*

He didn't stop.

The money was too easy. The routine was too comfortable. The stopping would require a confrontation with Felix that he couldn't envision and a conversation with the police that he couldn't face and a phone call to his parents that he couldn't make. The stopping would require becoming a different person, and Connor had spent twenty-seven years becoming this person, and this person was the only person he knew how to be.

So he didn't stop. And the days passed. And the money grew. And the packages moved through the city like blood through veins, invisible and essential and alive, and the man who carried them moved too, through streets he'd learned and markets he'd memorised and doors he'd opened without asking what was behind them, and the moving was so fluid and the earning was so regular and the lie was so complete that it felt, in every way that mattered, like a life.

The life that was ending. The life that was, even now, in its final weeks, counting down toward a bus station and a suitcase and a dog that could smell the truth through any amount of tape and nylon and denial.

But that was later. Now there was only the easy money and the easy days and the ceiling fan turning in the dorm where a name waited in the wood, the same name that had waited for the last one, the same patience, the same silence.
# Chapter 18: Jake Leaves

Jake announced it over breakfast on Day 35, between bites of Mama Siti's nasi lemak, with the casual finality of a man who made life decisions the way other people chose between menu items.

"Dude, I'm going to Langkawi."

Connor's fork paused. "When?"

"Tomorrow. I booked a flight last night. AirAsia, forty-seven ringgit. That's, like, twelve dollars. This country is insane."

He said it with the wide-eyed appreciation of a man who had discovered that the world was cheaper than San Diego and had decided this was the world's primary virtue. His backwards cap was on. His fake Supreme shirt -- the one Connor had bought him at the night market a lifetime ago -- was spotted with sambal. He was grinning.

"What about Chiara?" Connor asked.

"Chiara's in Penang. She texted me. She wants me to meet her in Langkawi next week. We're going to do this, like, island-hopping thing. Jet skis. Snorkelling. She knows a guy who rents a boat for fifty ringgit a day. A whole boat, dude."

Jake said *a whole boat* the way medieval explorers must have said *a whole continent* -- with the awed reverence of a man for whom scale was always surprising and always delightful.

Connor ate his nasi lemak. The rice was perfect -- coconut-infused, fluffy, the sambal adding heat in waves. Mama Siti was at the stove, stirring something that smelled of lemongrass and the deep, amber warmth of star anise. She didn't look at the boys. She was listening, though. She was always listening.

"How long?" Connor asked.

"I dunno. A week? Two? However long the money lasts." Jake shrugged. The shrug was his primary mode of planning -- the physical expression of a man whose relationship with the future was noncommittal. "You should come, dude. Langkawi's supposed to be sick. Duty-free island. The beer is, like, nothing."

"Duty-free beer." Connor managed a smile. "You're basically describing paradise."

"Right? So come."

"Can't. I've got work stuff. The social media gig."

"The social media gig." Jake said it with the faint puzzlement of a man who had never understood what Connor did for money and had accepted this ignorance the way he accepted most things -- cheerfully, without investigation. "Dude, you can post Instagrams from anywhere. That's literally the point."

"Yeah, but I've got the local clients too. The import-export thing."

"Oh right. Felix's thing." Jake took another bite of nasi lemak, chewed, swallowed. "Is that, like, going well?"

"Yeah. It's good. Steady."

"Cool." Jake nodded with the benign approval of a man for whom all work was equally mysterious. "Felix is a legend. That guy knows everyone."

"He does."

"You know what's funny? He asked me about it once. The delivery thing. Like, a few weeks ago. Said he could use another runner."

Connor's chest tightened. The sensation was brief -- a constriction, a flash of cold, the body's response to information the mind hadn't caught up with. "Felix asked you?"

"Yeah. On the rooftop. One night after Changkat. He was saying how the business was growing and he needed reliable people. I was going to do it but then Chiara happened and I kinda forgot." He laughed. "Classic me."

Classic Jake. Classic, golden-retriever, limbic-system-driven Jake, who had avoided recruitment into a drug trafficking network not through intelligence or caution or awareness but through the accidental intervention of an Italian bartender named Chiara who had great hair and a friend with a boat.

Connor looked at Jake. Jake was eating. Jake was happy. Jake was leaving tomorrow for an island where the beer was cheap and the jet skis were available and the most dangerous thing on the horizon was sunburn. Jake was getting out.

The realisation settled into Connor with the weight of something obvious that he'd somehow missed: Jake was getting out because Jake was leaving. The hostel, Felix, the packages, the schedule -- none of it could reach Jake on Langkawi. Langkawi was outside the network. Langkawi was outside the geography of drops and pickups and men who didn't make eye contact. Langkawi was free.

*I could go too.*

The thought arrived with a clarity that startled him. He could go. Tomorrow. He could book a forty-seven-ringgit flight and sit next to Jake on an AirAsia seat and be in Langkawi by afternoon and the schedule would be broken and Felix would be left with one fewer courier and the packages would be someone else's problem and Connor would be on a beach drinking duty-free beer and the fear would dissolve in salt water and sunlight.

He could go.

"Mate." Jake was looking at him. "You alright? You've gone weird."

"Yeah. Fine. Just thinking."

"Don't think too hard. That's my rule. Thinking leads to deciding and deciding leads to consequences and consequences are a whole thing."

The philosophy of Jake Porter, distilled to its essence: avoid consequences by avoiding decisions. It was absurd. It was also, in this specific moment, the most compelling argument for action that Connor had heard.

"Maybe I'll come," Connor said. "Let me think about it."

"Sick! We can share a room. I found a place on Booking.com -- a beach hut. Sixty ringgit a night. It has a hammock, dude. A *hammock*."

Jake said *hammock* the way Connor said *content* -- as though the word itself contained a lifestyle, a philosophy, a complete vision of what life should be.

They finished breakfast. Jake went upstairs to pack, which for Jake meant throwing everything he owned into a duffel bag with the systematic approach of a man throwing confetti. Connor sat at the kitchen counter with his empty banana leaf and thought about Langkawi.

---

He went to Felix's room at eleven.

The door was open. Felix was at his desk, laptop open, the screen angled away from the door. He looked up when Connor appeared, and the smile arrived -- warm, inclusive, the Felix smile that made you feel like the most important person in the building.

"Morning, Connor. Come in."

Connor stepped inside. The room was tidy, as always. The bed made. The shutters partially closed, the slats casting horizontal lines of light across the floor that looked like the bars of something Connor chose not to name. On the desk, beside the laptop, a phone -- not Felix's usual phone but a different one, a phone Connor hadn't seen before, matte black, no case, the screen dark but angled toward Felix's hand with the casual proximity of an object that was used often and urgently. It was the kind of phone Connor recognised because he had one too -- the burner, the second device, the phone that belonged to the other life. But Felix's second phone was different from Connor's second phone in the way a general's radio was different from a foot soldier's walkie-talkie: same technology, different altitude. Felix's second phone spoke to the people above. Connor's second phone received instructions from Felix. The hierarchy was in the hardware. Felix closed the laptop as Connor sat on the bed.

"Jake's leaving," Connor said. "Tomorrow. Langkawi."

"I know. He told me last night." Felix's expression was neutral -- the neutrality of a man receiving information he already possessed. "It's a good island. He'll enjoy it."

"He said you asked him about the delivery work."

Felix paused. The pause was imperceptible to anyone who wasn't watching for it, a fraction of a second in which the machine behind Felix's eyes recalibrated. "I mentioned it. Casually. He wasn't interested."

"He was interested. He just got distracted."

"Jake gets distracted by many things." Felix smiled. "It's his charm and his survival mechanism. He's too scattered to be useful. I recognised that early."

The sentence was clinical, delivered with the diagnostic precision of a man who assessed people the way a mechanic assessed engines -- for function, for reliability, for the probability of breakdown. Jake was unreliable. Therefore Jake was not recruited. Therefore Jake was safe.

Connor felt something move in his chest -- a cold thread of understanding, pulling tight. Felix had looked at both of them -- Connor and Jake -- and chosen Connor. Not because Connor was smarter, or braver, or more qualified. Because Connor was more vulnerable. Because Connor was broke and desperate and wanted to belong and would do what he was told and would not ask questions and would carry the packages and accept the money and call it logistics.

Felix had chosen him the way a predator chose prey: not the fastest, not the strongest, but the one most likely to follow.

"I was thinking about going with Jake," Connor said.

The words came out before the machine could stop them. They emerged from the territory that the machine hadn't yet colonised -- the shrinking, gasping territory of honest impulse, the last corner of Connor's consciousness where self-preservation still had a foothold.

Felix looked at him. The smile didn't vanish -- it thinned, the warmth drawing back from the surface like a tide retreating, revealing the architecture beneath. The architecture was not warm. The architecture was structural, functional, designed to bear weight.

"Going to Langkawi," Felix said. Not a question.

"Maybe. For a week or two. Jake's got a place--"

"What about the schedule?"

"I'd pause it. Come back after."

"The schedule doesn't pause, Connor." Felix's voice was level, measured, the German accent precise. "The clients expect deliveries. If you disappear for two weeks, I have to find someone else. And finding someone else takes time. Training time. Trust-building time. The network doesn't run on holidays."

The word *network* landed in the room like something dropped from a height. Felix had never used the word before. In his careful lexicon, the operation was always *the business*, *the work*, *the clients*. *Network* was a different word. *Network* implied structure, hierarchy, scale. *Network* implied something larger than two men and a schedule.

"I'm not talking about a holiday," Connor said. "I'm talking about a week. Maybe two."

"And I'm telling you that the clients won't wait a week." Felix leaned forward, elbows on his knees, the posture of a man about to deliver information he'd rather not deliver. "Connor, I've invested in you. Time, trust, money. You're the KL leg of a chain that runs to Penang and Singapore. If the KL leg goes dark, the whole chain stops. And when the chain stops, the people above me ask questions."

"The people above you?"

"The company. The management. Import-export doesn't run itself."

The correction was swift, smooth, the mask repositioned before the gap had fully opened. But the gap had opened, and Connor had seen through it -- briefly, incompletely, the way you see a room through a door that opens and closes in a draught. The room behind the door contained people Felix answered to. People who asked questions when the chain stopped. People who were not photographers, not backpackers, not the kind of people you met in hostels.

"I can't stop you from going to Langkawi," Felix said. His voice softened. The warmth returned, modulated, controlled. "But I'd ask you to think about it. The schedule is working. The money is good. You've built something here -- a routine, a life, a system that works. Langkawi is a week on a beach. This is a career."

A career. The word was grotesque and seductive simultaneously, the way all the best lies were. A career in carrying packages you'd never opened, for people you'd never met, through a city that would kill you for carrying them. The career counsellors at Monash University had never mentioned this option.

"Think about it," Felix said. "Sleep on it. And tomorrow, when Jake leaves, if you still want to go, I won't stop you. But I hope you'll stay."

The word *hope* performed its function. It was a word that implied vulnerability, that suggested Felix needed Connor rather than owned him, that recast the relationship as partnership rather than employment. *I hope you'll stay.* As though Connor were a guest at a dinner party, free to leave at any time, the door right there, the evening entirely optional.

Felix smiled. The smile was warm. The shutters filtered the midday sun into thin, pale lines that had narrowed since Connor sat down, or seemed to have narrowed -- the room contracting by imperceptible degrees, the walls holding their position but the air between them thickening, the temperature climbing despite the fan that turned overhead with the slow, indifferent rotation of something measuring time rather than moving it. The matte black phone sat on the desk. The laptop sat beside it, closed, its secrets sealed. The bed Connor was sitting on was made with hotel precision, the sheets tucked so tightly they could have been stitched to the mattress, and the tightness of the sheets was the tightness of the room was the tightness of the conversation -- everything held in place, everything contained, everything neat and functional and impossible to escape without making a mess that Felix would not tolerate.

Connor stood. "I'll think about it," he said, and the sentence was already a concession, because *I'll think about it* was the language of a man who had already decided and needed the fiction of deliberation to make the decision feel like one.

"Good," Felix said. He didn't stand. He didn't need to. The room had done its work.

And in the silence between Felix's hope and Connor's indecision, the trap closed another inch, the way traps closed -- not with a snap but with a settling, a gentle, incremental tightening that felt like gravity and looked like choice.

---

Jake left the next morning.

The goodbye was at the front door of the Lantern Hostel, in the early heat, with the morning sounds of Petaling Street providing the soundtrack -- vendor calls, motorcycle engines, the distant prayer from Masjid Jamek. Jake's duffel bag was enormous and poorly packed, bulging in organic shapes that suggested the contents had been organised by chaos theory.

"Dude. Come with me." Jake said it one more time, standing on the pavement, his Grab waiting, the backwards cap slightly askew. "Last chance. Hammock. Duty-free beer. Chiara's friend has a *boat*."

"I can't, mate. The work."

"The work will be here when you get back."

"I know. But the clients--"

"Connor." Jake was not, as a rule, a man who used people's names with emphasis. The emphasis meant something. "You look tired, dude. Like, not body tired. Brain tired. You look like someone who needs a beach."

"I'm fine."

"You always say you're fine. That's, like, your whole thing. 'I'm fine, mate. She'll be right.' But I'm watching you and you're not fine. You're doing this thing where you smile but your eyes don't move, and that's -- I don't know what that is, but it's not fine."

Jake Porter, who never noticed anything, had noticed something. This was perhaps the most alarming development of the past five weeks, more alarming than the checkpoint or the photographs or the printed law. If Jake could see it -- Jake, who navigated the world with the observational acuity of a golden retriever in a butterfly garden -- then the thing that was happening to Connor was no longer subtle. It was visible. It was on the surface. It was leaking through the mask.

"I'm fine," Connor said. "Have an epic time. Send me photos."

"I'll send you so many photos. My Instagram story is going to be, like, forty slides of just ocean."

They hugged. The bro hug -- one arm, two back-pats, the choreography of male affection that allowed intimacy without admitting to it. Jake smelled of sunscreen and the hostel's communal soap and something that was just Jake, the irreducible essence of a man who had never been complicated enough to be in danger.

Jake got in the Grab. The car pulled away. Connor stood on the pavement and watched it turn onto Jalan Sultan and disappear into the morning traffic, and he kept watching after it disappeared, the way you watch the space where a plane was after it passes behind a cloud, as though the watching could maintain the connection that the distance was dissolving.

The morning sounds of Petaling Street filled the space Jake had occupied. A vendor three doors down was unrolling a tarpaulin over a table of counterfeit watches, the fabric snapping in the breeze from a passing truck. The motorcycle repair shop across the lane was already running its compressor, the pneumatic hiss rising and falling like mechanical breathing. Someone was frying something -- oil crackling, the smell of garlic and dried chillies hitting the heat, the specific morning smell of Chinatown waking up and getting to work. The sounds were the same sounds Connor heard every morning. But the sounds had always been background -- texture, atmosphere, the ambient noise of a life he was living inside. Now the sounds were foreground, because the foreground was empty, because the person who had stood in it was gone.

He remembered the first night Jake had arrived at the Lantern, three weeks ago -- stumbling through the front door at eleven PM with the duffel bag and the backwards cap and the bewildered grin of a man who had been delivered to the wrong address and decided to stay. Connor had been on the rooftop with Felix, and Jake had appeared at the top of the stairs and said, "Dude, is this the hostel with the good breakfast? A guy at the airport told me to come here. I think he might have been lying." He hadn't been lying. And Jake had stayed, and for three weeks Jake had been the person Connor could sit with and not perform for, the person who required nothing except company and beer and the occasional reassurance that things were, indeed, "sick."

Now the pavement was empty. The Grab was gone. The morning continued without interruption.

The street was the same street it always was: vendors, tourists, motorbikes, the red doors of the temple, the phone repair shop with its fluorescent light. But something had changed. Something had been removed from the equation, and the equation now balanced differently.

Jake had been the last uncomplicated thing in Connor's life. The last person who knew him without suspecting him, who liked him without diagnosing him, who spent time with him without trying to save him. Jake was the mirror that showed Connor the version of himself he wanted to be -- the traveler, the adventurer, the mate. Without Jake, the mirror was gone, and what remained was the version that everyone else saw: the courier, the mule, the man with two phones and a schedule and a growing bank balance and a shrinking soul.

He went inside. The hostel was quiet. Mama Siti was in the kitchen. Mei Ling was at reception.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters said nothing. In Dorm 3, Bed 7 waited with its carved name and its thin mattress and its view of nothing but the air well's grey light.

He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. He closed his eyes.

Jake was gone. Priya would be gone in nine days. Tomoko was still watching. Felix was still smiling. And Connor was still here, in the building that had been many things, in the bed that had held many people, carrying things he'd never opened for reasons he'd never examined in a city that was simultaneously the most beautiful and the most dangerous place he'd ever been.

---

Priya found him in the common room at noon.

She was carrying her Lonely Planet -- the rubber-banded, dog-eared Bible of her travels -- and a cup of the hostel's instant coffee, which tasted like it had been manufactured from the concept of coffee rather than actual beans. She sat in the armchair opposite and set the guidebook on the coffee table, and the gesture had the weight of a woman placing a marker, establishing territory, preparing for something.

"Jake's gone," she said.

"Yeah."

"He asked you to go with him."

"He did."

"You should have gone."

Connor looked at her. She was wearing her white T-shirt and her round glasses and the jade bracelet he'd bought her, and her face was carrying the expression he'd come to think of as her clinical face -- the one that saw through surfaces, that diagnosed conditions the patient didn't know they had.

"I couldn't. The work--"

"The work." She said it the way you'd say the name of a disease you'd been tracking. "Connor, I have nine days left. Nine days before my flight. And in those nine days, I can either watch you keep doing what you're doing, or I can try one more time to make you see what you're doing. I'm choosing to try."

"Priya--"

"Don't. Don't 'Priya' me. Don't deflect. Don't charm. Just listen."

He listened. Not because he wanted to but because Priya's voice, when it reached this register -- the low, steady, unflinching register of a woman who had spent three years learning how to talk to people who were dying -- was a force he couldn't redirect.

"Jake leaving is the best thing that could happen to you, because Jake leaving proves it's possible. He walked out. He booked a flight for forty-seven ringgit and he walked out of this hostel and got in a car and left. Nobody stopped him. Felix didn't stop him. The network didn't stop him. He just left. Which means you can leave too."

"It's different. Jake wasn't--"

"Jake wasn't doing deliveries. I know. That's the point. Jake got out before he was in. You're in. But 'in' is not 'stuck.' You're not trapped, Connor. You're choosing. Every morning you wake up and choose to stay and choose to carry and choose not to look, and the choosing is the thing that's killing you."

The word *killing* sat between them. It was the first time Priya had used it without qualification, without softening, without the clinical distance that medical training provided. The word was raw and personal and it hit the air between them with the force of something thrown.

"I'm not dying," Connor said.

"You will be."

The sentence was delivered without emphasis, without drama, in the flat, informational tone of a doctor reading a test result. It entered the space between them and stayed there, occupying the air the way smoke occupies a room -- not filling it but changing its composition, making every breath after it different from every breath before. Connor's body received the sentence before his mind did: a contraction in his stomach, a coldness across his shoulders, the involuntary straightening of his spine that was the body's oldest response to threat, the primate reflex of a creature hearing a predator's step. He was sitting in an armchair in a common room in a hostel and his body was preparing to run. But there was nowhere to run to. The threat was not in the room. The threat was the room. The threat was the building and the city and the schedule and the man upstairs with the matte black phone and the precise German accent, and running from all of that would require a velocity Connor did not possess.

The silence after *you will be* lasted four seconds. Connor counted them -- not deliberately but with the automatic, metronomic awareness of a person for whom time has become material, each second a unit of weight added to the distance between the word and its consequence. Four seconds. Priya did not look away. She held his eyes with the steadiness of a woman who had said the worst thing she could say and would not retreat from it.

Priya looked at him and her eyes were wet behind her glasses and the wetness was not crying -- Priya did not cry, not about this, not yet -- but the pre-crying, the physiological response to a grief that had not yet fully formed because the thing it was grieving had not yet fully happened.

"I'm leaving in nine days," she said. "And when I leave, there will be nobody in this hostel who cares whether you live or die. Tomoko cares about the story. Mei Ling cares about liability. Razak cares about his arrangement. Felix cares about his schedule. Nobody will care about *you*."

The words were precise and they were cruel and they were accurate, and the accuracy was the cruelty, because what Priya was describing was not a possibility but a certainty -- the certainty that Connor Briggs, once stripped of the people who loved him, would be alone in a building full of strangers, carrying packages for a man who saw him as a tool, in a city that would process his death with the same bureaucratic efficiency it processed everything else.

"Come with me," she said. "To London. Or to Melbourne. Wherever. Just leave. Just get on a plane and leave this building and this city and this man, and we'll sort the rest out later. I'll buy your ticket. Right now. On my phone."

She had her phone in her hand. The screen was on. A flight booking app was open. The cursor blinked in the search field, waiting for a destination, waiting for a name, waiting for the word that would change everything.

Connor looked at the screen. He looked at Priya. He looked at the common room -- the ceiling fans, the red lanterns, the bookshelf, the TV, the coffee table where the printed law had sat for one night before being swept into the trash. He looked at the building that had become his home, the only home he'd had in four years, the home that was not a home but a trap designed to feel like one.

And he almost said yes. The word formed. It was there -- in his throat, behind his teeth, a single syllable that weighed nothing and would change everything. *Yes.* He could feel the future that lived inside the word: the booking confirmed, the e-ticket generated, the taxi to KLIA, the departure board showing Melbourne or London or anywhere, the plane climbing above the Titiwangsa Range and banking west and the city shrinking below him until it was a circuit board, until it was a smudge, until it was nothing, until the packages and the sports bags and the blue doors and the matte black phone were just coordinates on a map of a place he used to be. The cursor blinked in the search field of Priya's phone. The cursor was patient. The cursor would wait as long as it took. He could see, on the screen, the airline logos -- AirAsia, Malaysia Airlines, Malindo -- and the departure times arranged in rows, and the prices in ringgit, and each row was an exit, each price was the cost of freedom, and the cost was negligible, the cost was nothing, the cost was less than two deliveries to Mr. Tan on Jalan Ipoh.

He opened his mouth. The word was there.

"I can't," he said.

The word *can't* was a lie. The word was *won't*, and the difference between *can't* and *won't* was the difference between a man who was imprisoned and a man who had locked his own cell and thrown the key through the bars. The machine had intercepted the yes and replaced it with can't, the way it always did, the way it had intercepted the phone call to his father, the way it had intercepted the impulse to follow Jake to Langkawi, the way it intercepted every exit before Connor could reach it -- smoothly, silently, with the practised efficiency of a system that had learned to mistake its own survival for his.

Priya's thumb hovered over the screen. The flight app waited. The cursor blinked.

She closed the app. The screen went dark with a small, definitive sound -- the click of the lock button, the sound a door makes when it closes for the last time, the sound of an offer expiring. She put the phone face-down on the armrest, the gesture slow and deliberate, the way a doctor sets down a chart when the diagnosis is final. She picked up her Lonely Planet and held it against her chest, the rubber bands pressing into her arms, the guidebook a shield now rather than a map, something to hold against the body when the body needed holding. And she looked at Connor with the expression of a woman who has offered everything she has and watched it refused, and the expression was not anger and it was not contempt and it was not even sadness. It was something beyond those things -- the particular, terminal acceptance of a person who has done everything possible and knows that everything possible is not enough.

"Okay," she said.

She stood. She walked to the staircase. At the foot of the stairs, she stopped.

"I'll be here for nine more days," she said, without turning around. "If you change your mind. Any time. Any hour. I'll be here."

She climbed the stairs. She was gone.

Connor sat in the common room. The ceiling fans turned. The red lanterns glowed. The empty armchair where Priya had been sitting held the impression of her body -- a slight compression in the cushion, a warmth that faded as the minutes passed, the ghost of a presence that had tried to save him and could not.

He was alone. Not the hostel alone, the dorm-full-of-strangers alone that backpackers called solitude. Really alone. The alone of a man who has pushed away everyone who could help and clung to the one person who would destroy him. The alone that is the last stage before the falling, when the safety net has been removed and the ground is coming up and the only question is when, not if.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The burner phone buzzed. Felix.

*Tomorrow's schedule is confirmed. Jalan Ipoh, 10 AM. New item -- larger than usual. Be ready.*

Connor read the message. He typed back: *On it.*

He put the phone down. He stared at the ceiling. And somewhere on a highway heading north toward KLIA, in the back of a Grab, Jake Porter was telling his driver about a boat in Langkawi and a girl in Penang and a week that was going to be "absolutely epic, dude," and the driver was nodding with the patient courtesy of a man who was paid by the kilometre, and the car was moving, and Jake was leaving, and the leaving was the thing that saved him, though he would never know it, the way you never know the bullet that missed, the train you didn't catch, the bed in the hostel where the name was carved and the ceiling fan turned and the boy who stayed was the boy who died.
# Chapter 19: The Backpack

The backpack was red.

This was the first thing Connor noticed, and the noticing was significant because the sports bags had been black -- generic, anonymous, the kind of bag that dissolved into a crowd the way a raindrop dissolved into a puddle. The red backpack was different. It was a Deuter hiking pack, forty litres, the kind designed for multi-day treks, with a waist belt and chest strap and compression straps and the particular engineering that German outdoor brands applied to carrying loads over distance. It was also clearly not Connor's.

It was on the desk in Felix's room on the morning of Day 37. Beside it, Felix was standing with the posture of a man about to explain something complicated in simple terms.

"New delivery," Felix said. "Different from the usual."

Connor looked at the backpack. The backpack was full -- packed tight, the compression straps cinched, the zippers closed, the waist belt coiled and clipped. Whatever was inside had been arranged with the precision of someone who understood how to distribute weight in a hiking pack, the heavy items centred and close to the spine, the lighter items at the periphery.

"This goes to Sentul," Felix said. "Industrial area, north of the city. Address is in your work phone. Man named Ah Keat. He'll be at a warehouse -- I'll text you the description. The delivery is straightforward but the distance is longer than usual. Take a Grab there, walk the last two blocks. Ah Keat will meet you at the loading dock."

"Sentul." Connor hadn't been to Sentul. He knew it by reputation -- an area north of KL Sentral that was part industrial, part residential, the kind of neighbourhood that tourists didn't visit because there was nothing to visit, just warehouses and workshops and the working infrastructure that kept the city running.

"What's in it?" The question came out before the machine could intercept it, propelled by the backpack's colour, its size, its weight -- the sheer physical difference from the sports bags that had been his cargo for a month.

Felix looked at him. The look was the familiar one -- the half-second assessment, the recalibration, the smooth return to warmth. "Specialty electronics. Circuit boards, processors, high-value components. The backpack is better for this -- more padding, more protection. These are fragile items."

"Right."

"The payment is higher. RM800."

The number landed. RM800. Double the standard rate. The mathematics was clear and the mathematics was a message: the number was proportional to the risk, and the risk was proportional to the cargo, and the cargo was proportional to whatever was inside the red backpack that Felix had called specialty electronics with the same smooth conviction he'd called everything else phone components.

Connor reached for the backpack. He lifted it from the desk.

The weight was wrong.

Not in the way the sports bags had been wrong -- the subtle, almost-plausible wrongness of something slightly heavier than chargers and cables. This was a different wrongness. The backpack was heavy -- genuinely heavy, the weight of something dense and compressed, the weight pulling on his shoulder and arm with an insistence that demanded acknowledgement. He estimated seven kilograms. Maybe eight. The weight was distributed well -- centred, close to the spine, the work of someone who knew how to pack -- but the mass was there, unavoidable, physical, present.

Seven kilograms of circuit boards. Seven kilograms of processors. Seven kilograms of specialty electronics that required a forty-litre hiking backpack with compression straps and a waist belt and RM800 for an hour's work.

The machine ran. The machine produced: *Electronics are heavy. Circuit boards are dense. High-value components require careful packaging, which adds weight. The backpack is overengineered because the contents are fragile. Felix is paying more because the items are valuable, not because they're dangerous.*

The rationalisation was competent. It addressed the weight, the payment, the packaging. It provided an explanation that was internally consistent and externally plausible. But the rationalisation had a quality it hadn't had before -- a transparency, a thinness, the quality of a paint that's been applied too many times and has begun to crack, revealing the surface beneath.

Connor put the backpack on. Adjusted the straps. The waist belt sat on his hips and the chest strap crossed his sternum and the weight settled into the pack's frame, distributed, managed, but present -- always present, a constant physical reminder that what he was carrying was not the same as what he'd carried before.

"Be safe," Felix said. "The Sentul area can be rough. Stay on the main roads. Deliver, collect confirmation, come home."

Connor nodded. He walked to the door.

"Connor."

He turned.

"Don't open the backpack."

The instruction was the same as always. But this time Felix didn't smile when he said it. This time the words were delivered flat, without the warm packaging of a boss reminding an employee of procedure, without the casual ease that made the instruction sound reasonable. The instruction was delivered the way a command is delivered -- clean, direct, non-negotiable -- and the absence of the smile was its own communication, a signal that whatever was in the red backpack was different enough from whatever had been in the sports bags that Felix had abandoned the pretence of normality and replaced it with the raw mechanics of control.

"Wouldn't dream of it," Connor said.

---

The Grab to Sentul took forty minutes.

Connor sat in the back seat with the red backpack beside him, occupying the middle seat like a passenger, its bulk pressing against his thigh with a warmth that was not warmth but weight -- the dense, insistent weight of something that wanted to be acknowledged. The backpack was the colour of a warning. The colour of stop signs and fire extinguishers and the little flags that divers planted on the surface to say *something is happening below*. In the dim back seat of a silver Proton Saga, the red was muted, almost maroon, but it was still there, still wrong, still the colour of a thing that did not belong in a car with a pine-scented air freshener and a phone playing Waze directions in Bahasa Melayu.

The driver was a Malay man in his fifties, soft-faced, wearing a songkok and a button-down shirt that suggested another life -- a teacher, perhaps, or a government clerk moonlighting for Grab. He glanced at the backpack in his mirror. He glanced at Connor. The glance contained the calculation that all Grab drivers performed: assess the passenger, assess the cargo, decide whether to speak or drive in silence.

"Going to Sentul, ya?" he said. His English was careful, practiced, the English of a man who used it as a professional courtesy rather than a native instrument.

"Yeah."

"Business or visiting?"

The question was casual. The question was devastating. Connor said the thing that backpackers said when they didn't want to answer questions.

"Just checking out a different part of the city. Trying to see the real KL, you know?"

The driver smiled. "Sentul is real," he said. "Very real. Not many tourist there. You are the first *orang putih* I take to Sentul in a long time."

*Orang putih.* White person. Connor had heard the term before -- in markets, in hawker stalls, always at the edge of conversations he wasn't meant to understand. The term was not hostile. It was classificatory, and in Sentul, the category it assigned him -- *foreigner* -- would be visible in a way it was not in Bukit Bintang or Petaling Street, where white skin was part of the landscape, expected, catered to, absorbed.

The city changed as they moved north. The gleaming towers of the city centre -- KLCC, the Petronas Towers, the glass-and-steel monuments to Malaysia's ambition -- gave way as they turned onto Jalan Ipoh, the broad artery that ran north through the city's older body. The buildings lowered. The glass and steel surrendered to concrete and corrugated zinc. The pavements cracked. The traffic thickened with lorries and motorcycles, the heavy diesel machinery of a city's circulatory system, the vehicles that moved goods rather than people. Connor watched through the window and the watching was like watching a translation -- the same city, rendered in a different language, the tourist-facing version replaced by the version that existed when the tourists weren't looking.

He checked the GPS on the driver's phone. The blue dot was moving through streets he had never seen, into a territory that his mental map of KL -- bounded by Petaling Street to the south, KLCC to the east, Changkat to the west, the monorail to the north -- simply did not contain. He was off his map. He was in the white space at the edges, the part of the city where @ConnorGoesGlobal had never taken a photo because there was nothing to photograph, nothing that would generate engagement, nothing that would look good with a Valencia filter and a caption about discovering hidden gems.

The backpack sat beside him. Its weight had shifted during a turn, pressing harder against his thigh, and the pressure was a nudge, the physical equivalent of a hand on the shoulder saying *I'm still here, I'm still heavy, I'm still the thing you're pretending not to know about*.

Sentul was grey. Not uniformly grey -- there were patches of colour: a Hindu temple's painted tower rising from a row of workshops, its gopuram crowded with painted gods in blues and greens, a roti canai stall with a yellow awning where a man was stretching dough with the wrist-flick mastery of a lifetime's practice, a school playground where children in blue uniforms were running in the heat. But the dominant tone was industrial grey, the grey of concrete and steel and the flat, functional buildings that housed the machinery of commerce. This was a neighbourhood that existed for the verb *to work*, and the work was visible everywhere -- in the oil stains on the road, in the forklift tracks on the pavement, in the men in coveralls walking with the slow, deliberate gait of people who carried heavy things for a living.

"Here, ya?" The driver had pulled over on a wide, quiet street. Ahead, the road continued past warehouses with corrugated walls and loading docks.

Connor looked at the backpack. He looked at the street. He was two blocks from the warehouse, as instructed, and the instruction to walk the last two blocks was not about exercise or fresh air -- the instruction was about distance, about separation, about ensuring that no Grab driver's trip history showed a pickup or a dropoff at the exact address where a man named Ah Keat weighed things on a digital scale.

"Yeah. Here's good. Thanks."

He took the backpack. He opened the door. The heat hit him -- not the tourist-district heat modulated by air-conditioned malls and shaded walkways, but the raw heat of an industrial street, rising from asphalt and zinc and the exhaust of idling lorries. The air smelled of machine oil and hot metal and, beneath that, the faint sweet rot of tropical vegetation reclaiming the gaps between buildings.

Connor got out of the Grab two blocks from the warehouse, as instructed. The street was quiet -- no vendors, no tourists, no market stalls. Just warehouses and workshops and parked lorries and the smell of machine oil and hot metal. A stray dog trotted past on some private mission, its ribs visible under matted fur.

He walked. The backpack's weight was on his hips and shoulders and spine, and the weight was conversation, the weight was communication, the weight was the backpack saying *I am here and I am heavy and you know why I am heavy and you are choosing not to know*.

The warehouse was at the end of the street. A large building, single-storey, corrugated zinc walls, a loading dock with a metal roller door raised to half-height. Outside, a white van was parked at an angle, its rear doors open. A man was leaning against the van, smoking.

Ah Keat was approximately forty-five. Chinese-Malaysian. Short, stocky, his forearms thick and scarred, the build of someone who moved things for a living. He wore a white polo shirt stained with something dark, dark trousers, rubber-soled boots. His face was flat, unreadable, the face of a man who had optimised himself for function rather than expression.

He saw Connor approach. His eyes went to the backpack. He straightened from the van, dropped the cigarette, and ground it under his boot with the automatic precision of a man who ground out a hundred cigarettes a day.

"You're the Australian," he said. Not a question.

"Yeah. From Felix."

"Inside."

He ducked under the roller door and Connor followed. The warehouse interior was dim -- high ceiling, fluorescent tubes hanging from chains, only half of them lit. The space was large and mostly empty, the concrete floor stained with oil and scored by forklift tracks. Along one wall, metal shelving held boxes of various sizes. Along another, a workbench with tools, a lamp, and a large digital scale.

A scale. The same kind of scale Tomoko had photographed in Wei's shop. The flat metal platform, the LCD readout, the precision equipment of a person who measured things in grams.

Ah Keat held out his hand. Connor slipped the backpack off and handed it over. The weight transferred -- from his shoulders to Ah Keat's hands, from his responsibility to someone else's -- and the transfer produced a relief so intense it was almost physical, a lightness that made him feel briefly, absurdly, like he could float.

Ah Keat took the backpack to the workbench. He unzipped it with a single fluid motion, the sound of the zipper loud in the warehouse silence, the sound of something being opened that should not be opened in the presence of the person who had carried it. Connor was standing five metres away, near the roller door, and from five metres, in the dim light, with Ah Keat's body partially blocking the view, he could see the backpack's contents.

They were not circuit boards.

The contents were packages. Multiple packages, each one wrapped in layers of cling film, then sealed in vacuum bags, then wrapped again in something opaque -- plastic sheeting, black, taped shut. The packages were rectangular, flat, dense. Ah Keat removed them one by one and placed them on the workbench, and the placing was careful, methodical, the movements of a man handling material that required respect. His hands moved with the efficiency of repetition -- no hesitation, no fumbling, no wasted motion. He had done this before. He had done this a hundred times, perhaps a thousand, and the doing had been refined into a choreography, a set of movements as practised and automatic as a surgeon tying sutures or a mechanic changing spark plugs.

Seven packages. Each one approximately the size of a paperback novel. Each one sealed, wrapped, anonymous.

The fluorescent light above the workbench hummed at a frequency that was almost too low to hear, a vibration that lived in the teeth and the sinuses. The light cast everything in the flat, shadowless pallor of an operating theatre -- every surface rendered in clinical detail, every edge sharp, every colour drained to its institutional version. Under that light, the packages looked medical. The vacuum seal looked sterile. The cling film caught the fluorescence and threw it back in small, sharp gleams, and the gleams were like the flash of instruments, the glint of things designed to cut or measure or quantify.

Ah Keat placed one on the scale. The LCD display flickered and resolved. Connor was five metres away. The display was small. The numbers were not fully visible.

But the gesture was visible. The weighing was visible. The scale, the packages, the careful handling, the vacuum seal, the multiple layers of wrapping designed to contain something that could not be contained by brown paper and tape -- all of it was visible, present, undeniable, the accumulated evidence of every suspicion he'd suppressed and every question he'd refused to ask.

Connor watched. His hands were at his sides and his hands were doing something he had not authorised -- his right hand was opening and closing, the fingers curling into the palm and releasing, curling and releasing, the unconscious rhythm of a body trying to discharge the electricity that the mind refused to acknowledge. His breathing had changed. He could hear it -- the shallow, too-fast breathing of an animal in the presence of a predator, the breathing that said *run* in a language older than thought. He did not run. He stood. He breathed. He watched Ah Keat place the second package on the scale and note the number and place the third package and note the number, and each placement was a sentence in a language Connor understood but would not translate, a language that spoke in grams and vacuum seals and the precise, clinical movements of a man who weighed things that could not legally be weighed.

He almost spoke. The word was rising in his throat -- not a specific word but the precursor to a word, the gathering of breath and intention that preceded speech, the moment before the moment of asking *what is that* or *what am I carrying* or simply *what*. The word gathered. The word rose. And the machine intercepted it -- not gently, not with the smooth rationalisation of the early weeks, but violently, desperately, the way a hand clamps over a mouth, the way a door slams shut on something that must not be let in. The machine killed the word before it reached his lips and replaced it with silence, and the silence was louder than any word would have been, the silence of a man who had chosen not to ask because the answer was already inside him, fully formed, waiting in the dark.

Connor's mind was running -- not the machine, not the rationalisation engine, but the other mind, the deeper one, the one that processed information before the conscious mind could edit it. The deeper mind was assembling the evidence: the scale, the packages, the wrapping, the weight, the payment (RM800 for an hour's work), the location (a warehouse in an industrial area), the contact (a man who didn't smile, who didn't talk, who weighed things on a digital scale).

The deeper mind reached a conclusion. The conclusion was a word. The word was *drugs*.

The machine intercepted. The machine ran. The machine produced: *You don't know what those packages contain. They could be specialty electronics. They could be high-value components that require vacuum sealing for moisture protection. Circuit boards are sensitive to humidity. The scale could be measuring the total weight for shipping purposes. You're five metres away and you can't see the display and you're making assumptions based on packaging and Ah Keat's demeanour and your own paranoia.*

The rationalisation worked. Not completely -- a crack remained, a fissure in the wall, a space through which the truth leaked like water through a dam. But the wall held. The wall had been built by a master craftsman -- twenty-seven years of practised denial, of looking away, of choosing the comfortable interpretation over the accurate one -- and the wall could hold a crack. The wall could hold many cracks. The wall could hold until the moment when the water pressure exceeded the wall's capacity, and then the wall would break, and the breaking would be the end.

Ah Keat finished. He rezipped the backpack, empty now except for the padding, and handed it back to Connor. The backpack was light -- featherweight, impossibly light after the walk here, the absence of the weight producing a vertigo, a sensation of something missing.

"Done," Ah Keat said.

Connor took the backpack. He walked out of the warehouse. The sunlight hit him like a wall. The stray dog was still there, lying in the shade of a lorry, its ribs moving with the slow breathing of an animal that had accepted its conditions.

His work phone buzzed: RM800 transferred.

He walked to the main road. He flagged a Grab. The wait was seven minutes. He stood on the pavement with the empty backpack hanging from one hand, and the emptiness was its own sensation -- a lightness that was not relief but vertigo, the weightlessness of a thing removed, the phantom ache of an amputation. His shoulder still carried the memory of the weight, the muscles still braced for seven kilograms that were no longer there, and the absence of the weight was worse than the weight had been, because the weight had been a question and the absence was an answer, and the answer was that he had carried something to a warehouse and a man had taken it and weighed it in grams and the something was now gone and the grams were now known and the transaction was complete and Connor was standing on a pavement in Sentul holding a red backpack that contained nothing but the ghost of what it had contained.

The Grab arrived. Another silver Proton, another anonymous back seat, another driver who did not speak. Connor sat with the backpack on his lap, his arms around it, and watched the city translate itself back -- the warehouses giving way to shops, the shops to signboards in Mandarin and Tamil, the roads widening, the traffic shifting from lorries to sedans. The city reversed. The industrial grey dissolved into the commercial colour of Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the sari shops and electronics stores, and then they were crossing the river and the KLCC skyline was ahead, the Petronas Towers rising above everything like a pair of chrome exclamation marks, and the towers were a signal, a geographic reset, a declaration that he was back in the version of KL that he knew, the version that was legible and navigable and safe.

His phone buzzed. Not the work phone -- the real phone, the Connor phone, the phone that connected to @ConnorGoesGlobal and the 4,200 followers who believed he was living the dream. An Instagram notification: someone had liked a photo he'd posted three days ago, a sunset from the hostel rooftop, the Petronas Towers backlit in orange and violet, the caption reading *Golden hour in KL. This city never gets old.* The photo had forty-seven likes. The photo was beautiful. The photo was a lie -- not in its composition but in its implication, which was that the man who took it was a man whose life was sunsets and rooftops and the uncomplicated beauty of a city seen from above. The man who took that photo did not carry red backpacks to warehouses. The man who took that photo did not watch men weigh packages on digital scales. The man who took that photo existed on a screen, in a curated gallery of a life that was increasingly fictional, and the distance between that man and the man sitting in the back of a Grab with an empty backpack on his lap was a distance that could not be measured in kilometres or ringgit but only in the specific, corrosive unit of self-knowledge that Connor had spent five weeks refusing to acquire.

He closed Instagram. He put the phone in his pocket.

He thought about the packages on the workbench. The vacuum seal. The scale. The weighing.

*Specialty electronics,* the machine said. *High-value components. Moisture-sensitive circuit boards.*

The machine said it. Connor heard it. The machine was still running but the machine was tired, the gears grinding, the output thinner, the product less convincing. The machine had been running for five weeks and the fuel was running low and the cracks were multiplying and the water pressure was building and the wall was holding but the wall was not as strong as it had been, not as thick, not as sure.

He went home. He showered. He stood under the cold water in the second-floor bathroom -- the bathroom with the cracked tiles and the showerhead that delivered water in an uneven, pulsing stream, the bathroom where someone had scratched @HostelReaper into the grout between the tiles near the drain -- and felt the water on his skin and let it run over his face and his shoulders and down the body that had carried the backpack to Sentul and back. The water was cold. The cold was supposed to be a cleansing, a reset, the physical equivalent of pressing delete, but the water only cleaned the skin and the thing that needed cleaning was not on the skin. The thing that needed cleaning was behind the wall, behind the cracks, in the place where the deeper mind had assembled the evidence and reached the conclusion and been silenced by the machine, and no amount of cold water from a hostel showerhead would reach that place.

He stood under the water until the cold stopped feeling cold and started feeling like nothing, the sensation flattening into numbness that was almost peace. Then he thought about seven kilograms and RM800 and a scale in a warehouse, and the numbness broke, and the water was cold again.

He thought about Priya's words: *You're not trapped. You're choosing.*

He thought about Jake, on a beach in Langkawi, drinking duty-free beer, the most dangerous thing in his day a sunburn.

He thought about his father: *The rules don't care who you are.*

He thought about David's brother, in Kajang Prison, counting days.

He thought about the word *drugs* and the wall that held it back and the cracks in the wall and the water behind the cracks.

He turned off the shower. He dried himself with the blue Sea to Summit towel -- the towel that had been with him through twelve countries, that smelled of every place he'd been, that would be with him at the end. He hung the towel on the hook behind the bathroom door and went to his dorm and lay on Bed 7 and stared at the ceiling and did not sleep.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The building breathed.

And in a warehouse in Sentul, a man named Ah Keat was weighing the last of seven packages on a digital scale, and the scale's LCD display read a number, and the number was in grams, and the total across all seven packages was a number that Connor would never know but that the Malaysian legal system would eventually quantify with the precision and the finality that the law brought to all quantification, the law that didn't distinguish and didn't forgive and didn't care who you were or where you came from or how many countries your towel had been to.

The number was enough.

The number was more than enough.
# Chapter 20: The Phone Shop

Wei's phone repair shop had been next to the hostel since the day Connor arrived, and Connor had walked past it every day without going inside.

This was about to change. The burner phone buzzed at 8:47 AM on Day 39 with a message from Felix that was different from the usual messages in one specific way: the pickup location was not Felix's room.

*Today's item is at Wei's. Go to the shop. Tell him Felix sent you. He'll have a charger box for you. Drop at Bukit Bintang, Danny, Lot 22B. RM500.*

Connor read the message standing at the kitchen counter, Mama Siti's nasi lemak growing cold on its banana leaf. He read it again. The message was clear. The message was also an escalation, though Connor would not recognise it as such until later, when the recognition no longer mattered. Previously, Felix had been the intermediary -- the packages originated from Felix's room, passed through Felix's hands, carried Felix's imprint. The instruction to go directly to Wei's shop removed Felix from the chain. It connected Connor to the source.

He left the hostel at nine fifteen. Turned left. Walked three metres to the phone repair shop.

The shop occupied the ground floor of a pre-war shophouse identical to the hostel's -- narrow, deep, the facade covered in layers of signage: WEI PHONE REPAIR in hand-painted letters, SCREEN REPLACEMENT ALL BRANDS in a laminated sheet, CHEAP FAST RELIABLE in marker on cardboard. The window display was a archaeology of mobile technology: cracked iPhone 6s, Samsung cases, coiled USB cables, a Nokia 3310 that looked like it had survived a war. A bell hung above the door, the kind that rang when you pushed it open, a sound from a different century.

Connor pushed. The bell rang. He stepped inside.

The interior was narrow -- maybe two metres wide, four metres deep -- and every surface was covered. The walls were shelving, the shelving was full: phone cases in plastic bags, screen protectors in dusty boxes, earbuds on cardboard cards, charging cables coiled like hibernating snakes. The counter ran the length of the right wall, waist-high, wooden, scarred with burns from a soldering iron. Behind the counter, more shelving, more components, and a workbench with a magnifying lamp, a soldering station, and the small, precise tools of a repair technician -- tweezers, screwdrivers, spudgers, suction cups.

Wei was behind the counter.

He was approximately forty-five. Chinese-Malaysian. Thin, with the particular thinness of a man who forgot to eat, the bones of his wrists visible below rolled-up sleeves. His face was narrow, his eyes behind rectangular glasses, his expression carrying the concentrated focus of someone who spent his days peering at small things and had trained his features for precision rather than warmth. He wore a grey polo shirt and cotton trousers and had the posture of a man who spent twelve hours a day hunched over a workbench.

He looked up when Connor entered. The look was brief -- a flash of recognition, the quick assessment of a man who knew who Connor was and had been expecting him. Then the look dropped back to the phone he was working on, a Samsung with its back panel removed, its electronic guts exposed.

"Felix sent me," Connor said.

Wei nodded. Still not looking up. His soldering iron touched a connection point on the phone's board, and a tiny plume of smoke rose -- the smoke carrying the sharp, metallic smell of heated solder, a smell that lived in the olfactory territory between chemistry and craft.

"Wait," Wei said.

Connor waited. The shop was quiet -- a muffled, dense quiet, the sound absorbed by the packed merchandise on every surface, the only noises the faint hiss of the soldering iron and the tick of a wall clock that was fifteen minutes slow.

He looked around. The shop was exactly what it appeared to be: a phone repair business, functioning, stocked, legitimate. Customers had been here -- he could see the intake forms on a clipboard beside the register, handwritten, names and phone models and problems: *screen crack*, *battery dead*, *no charge*. The shelf behind the counter held phones in various states of repair, each in a labelled plastic bag. The business was real. The phone repair was real.

But the business was also something else. Connor could feel it -- the *else-ness* of the space, the way a room feels when it has more than one purpose, the way a person feels when they have more than one identity. The shop was a shop, and it was also the place where the packages originated. It was the place where Tomoko had photographed the digital scale. It was the place where Felix had stood at eleven PM with his hands flat on the counter, looking at something with the focused intensity of a man conducting business that was not phone repair.

Wei set down the soldering iron. He stood. He was taller than Connor expected -- six feet, maybe more -- the height hidden by his hunched posture. He moved to the back of the shop, to a door that Connor hadn't noticed because it was the same colour as the wall, partially hidden by a shelf of phone cases, the doorframe visible only by the thin shadow at its edge.

He opened the door. "Come," he said.

Connor followed. The door opened onto a corridor -- short, dark, maybe two metres -- and the corridor opened onto a room.

The back room was larger than the shop. It had the dimensions of the full shophouse ground floor, maybe four by six metres, the ceiling low, the walls unpainted concrete. A single fluorescent tube hung from the ceiling, casting the flat, blue-white light that fluorescents produced -- the light of police stations and hospitals and places where beauty was irrelevant.

The room was a workshop. A different kind of workshop from the front -- not phone repair but something else, something that operated at a different scale and with a different purpose. A long metal table ran the centre of the room, stainless steel, clean. On the table: rolls of cling film, boxes of vacuum bags, a vacuum sealer the size of a shoebox, rolls of black plastic sheeting, tape dispensers, scissors. And at the far end of the table, the digital scale -- the same scale from Tomoko's photograph, the flat metal platform catching the fluorescent light, the LCD display dark, waiting.

On the floor, beside the table, cardboard boxes. Stacked. Closed. Connor counted six.

Wei moved to a shelf against the back wall. The shelf held commercial packaging -- boxes for phone chargers, the kind you'd buy in any electronics shop: white cardboard, printed with product photos and spec lists and CE marks and the reassuring language of legitimate commerce. Wei selected a box. It was the size of a large phone charger -- rectangular, maybe twenty centimetres long, ten wide, five deep. He brought it to the table.

The box was already sealed. Cellophane-wrapped, the wrap tight and professional, the kind of wrapping that suggested factory packaging, mass production, the clean supply chain of a legitimate product. The box's label read: POWERMAX ULTRA FAST CHARGER -- USB-C/LIGHTNING -- 65W. Below the text, a photo of a white charger with multiple ports.

Wei held the box out. Connor took it.

The box was heavier than a phone charger.

Not dramatically heavier. Not the seven kilograms of the red backpack. But heavier than the plastic and circuit board of a 65W charger, heavier than the cardboard and cellophane that held it, heavier in a way that his hands registered and his mind, trained by five weeks of carrying things that were heavier than they should be, identified immediately.

The box weighed approximately 120 grams. A charger of this type weighed perhaps 50 grams. The difference -- 70 grams -- was the weight of what was inside the box that was not a charger.

Seventy grams. More than the fifty-gram threshold. The mandatory threshold. The death threshold.

The number appeared in his mind -- 50 grams, the number from Astrid's lecture at the bar, the number from Priya's printed law, the number that sat at the intersection of chemistry and jurisprudence like a tripwire across a road. Fifty grams of methamphetamine triggered the presumption of trafficking. Fifty grams reversed the burden of proof. Fifty grams changed the sentence from years to death.

The box in Connor's hand was heavier than fifty grams. The box in Connor's hand was a death sentence wrapped in cellophane and printed with a charger logo.

He stood in the back room of Wei's phone repair shop and held the box and the box held the truth and the truth was in his hands and his hands were shaking.

Not visibly. The shake was internal, subcutaneous, the body's honest response to a fact the mind had spent five weeks refusing to process. His fingers were steady on the cardboard. His arms were still. But inside, beneath the skin, the tremor was there -- the vibration of a system under stress, the hum of a machine running past its tolerances.

Wei watched him. Wei's expression had not changed. It had not changed because Wei's expression was not a variable -- it was a constant, the flat, neutral face of a man who assembled packages and handed them to couriers and did not invest emotion in the handoff because emotion was not part of the process. Wei was a function. Wei performed his function. The function did not require expression.

"Danny. Bukit Bintang," Wei said. The instruction was delivered in the same flat tone as *come* and *wait*, the vocabulary of a man who communicated in commands and expected compliance.

Connor put the box in his daypack. The box sat in the bag alongside his water bottle and his cracked phone and the copy of *The Beach* he was never going to read. The box was the size of a charger. The box looked like a charger. The box, to any observer, to any police officer, to any checkpoint, was a charger -- a tourist's charger, purchased at a shop in Chinatown, carried in a daypack, unremarkable.

Unless they opened it. Unless they weighed it. Unless they ran a test on the white crystalline substance that was packed inside the charger housing in a sealed plastic bag, occupying the space where the transformer and voltage regulators should have been. Unless they found the 70 grams -- or whatever the actual weight was, the weight that Wei had measured on the scale before sealing the box, the weight that was above the threshold, above the line, above the point of no return.

Connor walked out of the back room. Through the corridor. Through the shop. Past the Nokia 3310 and the cracked iPhones and the coiled cables and the bell above the door that rang when he pushed it open.

The morning heat of Petaling Street hit him. The sound of the market hit him. The smell -- fried dough, diesel, incense from the temple -- hit him. The city was there, real and present and indifferent, and Connor was there too, standing on the pavement with a daypack containing a box containing something that would kill him if he was caught with it, and he was going to carry it to Bukit Bintang and give it to a man named Danny in the back of a defunct karaoke bar and collect RM500 and come home and eat Mama Siti's nasi lemak and post on Instagram and pretend that he was living the dream.

He walked. He didn't take a Grab. He walked because the walking gave him time and the time gave his mind the space to process what it had seen -- the back room, the table, the cling film, the vacuum bags, the scale -- and the processing was necessary because the machine needed raw material and the raw material had to be converted from evidence into something else, something manageable, something that allowed him to keep walking.

The machine ran. The machine said: *The back room is a packaging facility. Import-export businesses have packaging facilities. The cling film and vacuum bags are for moisture protection. The scale is for weight compliance -- shipping companies charge by weight. The charger box is a branded product that Wei packages for distribution. Everything you saw is consistent with a legitimate electronics business.*

The rationalisation was the weakest one the machine had ever produced. It was thin, translucent, the structural equivalent of tissue paper over a hole. Connor could feel its inadequacy. He could feel the wind through it, the cold air of truth moving through the gaps in the tissue, touching his skin with a cold he'd been keeping out for five weeks and could no longer fully exclude.

But the tissue held. Barely. By a thread. By the single thread of *I don't know for certain*, which was the last and most powerful rationalisation of all -- the argument from ignorance, the defence of the man who has seen the evidence and heard the testimony and felt the weight in his hands and still, still, can claim that he doesn't know because he hasn't tested the substance, hasn't read the scale, hasn't held the truth in his palms and said its name aloud.

He walked to Bukit Bintang. The walk took twenty-five minutes through the Saturday crowds -- Petaling Street to Jalan Sultan to Jalan Bukit Bintang, the route threading through the gleaming heart of KL's retail district, past Pavilion and Lot 10, past the monorail station where tourists funnelled out in bright packs, past the Sephora and the H&M and the durian stall that sat among the luxury brands like a dare, pumping its sulfurous, custard-sweet stench into the air-conditioned draft that leaked from every automatic door. The Saturday shoppers moved around him -- families with strollers, Malay teenagers in streetwear, Japanese tour groups following raised umbrellas, Indonesian women in headscarves carrying bags from Zara. The normality of it was obscene. The normality was a wall of sound and colour and human purpose against which Connor moved with a daypack on his back containing a death sentence sitting next to a water bottle and a copy of *The Beach* he'd bought in Bali and never opened past page twelve.

He could feel the box. Not its weight -- 120 grams was nothing, less than a phone, less than a wallet -- but its *presence*, the way you could feel a spider on your arm before you saw it, the way the body registered proximity to danger before the mind had language for it. The box sat in the main compartment of his daypack, cushioned by a rolled-up hoodie, adjacent to the water bottle whose condensation was probably dampening the cellophane wrapper, and the casualness of the arrangement -- a charger box next to a water bottle next to a paperback, the inventory of a tourist's afternoon -- was the most terrifying thing about it. The thing that would kill him was touching the thing that kept him hydrated. The death penalty was nestled against a novel about backpackers in Thailand. The geometry of the daypack was a joke that no one was telling and everyone would eventually understand.

He turned off Jalan Bukit Bintang into a side alley he'd walked once before, nine days ago, on Day 30. The alley was narrow -- barely wide enough for a car -- and the transition from the main road was immediate: the gleaming storefronts vanished, replaced by the back-end infrastructure of the entertainment district, the service doors and dumpsters and stacked crates and the accumulated grime that luxury required but refused to display. Halfway down the alley, on the left, the defunct karaoke bar. The sign was still there -- GOLDEN VOICE KTV -- the neon tubes dark and dusty, the windows papered over from the inside, the roller door pulled down to knee height. The place had the particular stillness of a business that had died and been repurposed without anyone bothering to change the skin.

Connor ducked under the roller door. The interior was dark after the alley's glare, and the darkness smelled of old beer and dust and the chemical residue of whatever cleaning product had last been applied to the vinyl upholstery of the karaoke booths, which were still there, pushed against the walls, their foam cushions split and leaking stuffing. A mirror ball hung from the ceiling, dead, its facets dulled by a film of grime. The room was larger than it looked from outside -- deep, extending back into the building's interior, the rear wall lost in shadow.

Danny was at a table in the back. Mid-twenties, Chinese-Malaysian, thin, the same nervous energy Connor remembered from Day 30, the energy of a man who occupied the disposable middle of a chain and knew it. Danny's face was lit from below by his phone screen, the blue light carving his features into something sharper than they were, and when he looked up at Connor the expression was not greeting or hostility but the flat, transactional blankness of a man who was a function performing his function.

Connor took off the daypack. Unzipped it. Took out the charger box. Placed it on the table. The box sat on the scratched wood between them -- POWERMAX ULTRA FAST CHARGER, the logo cheerful, the cellophane catching a thread of light from the cracked roller door -- and the placing was the act, the handoff, the transfer of 70 grams from one set of hands to another, from one jurisdiction of guilt to another, though the law would not see it that way, the law would see Connor's hands and the 70 grams and the road between them and would draw a line that was straight and final and indifferent to the question of whose table the box was sitting on now.

Danny took it. He didn't weigh it. He didn't open it. He put it in a drawer beneath the table and the drawer closed and the box disappeared and the disappearance was the end of Connor's involvement and the beginning of something else, something that moved down the chain to places and people Connor would never see, and the not-seeing was the last, thinnest wall between him and the full knowledge of what he was part of.

His work phone buzzed. RM500 transferred. The notification produced the familiar pulse -- the small, warm dopamine hit that five weeks of Pavlovian conditioning had wired into his nervous system, the chemical reward for the completed task. But this time the dopamine was fighting something. This time the warmth was competing with a nausea that rose from somewhere lower, somewhere the conditioning hadn't reached, and the two sensations -- the pleasure and the sickness -- coexisted in his chest like two frequencies played simultaneously, producing a dissonance that was not one thing or the other but a third thing, a new thing, the sound of a man who was being rewarded for something that was killing him.

He went home. He sat in the common room. He sat in the armchair where Priya usually sat -- the worn velvet one by the window, the one that smelled faintly of her shampoo, coconut and something herbal -- and he stared at the wall and he thought about nothing, which was the hardest work he'd ever done, because nothing was now full of everything he'd seen and everything he'd refused to know and the space required to hold all of it was larger than his mind and the overflow was leaking into his body, into his chest, into his hands, into the tremor that was no longer internal but visible, his fingers shaking against his thighs in a rhythm that matched the ceiling fan.

The tremor had started in his hands -- the fine, subcutaneous vibration that had been with him in Wei's back room -- but now it spread. It moved up his forearms, into his biceps, into the muscles of his shoulders, the way cold spreads through water, the way a crack spreads through glass, following the lines of least resistance until the whole structure was involved. His hands shook against his thighs. His forearms trembled. His jaw was clenched so tight that his molars ached, the body's attempt to contain the shaking by bracing against itself, which did not work, because the shaking was not muscular but systemic, the full-body response of a nervous system that had been carrying a load it was not designed to carry and had, in the dim back room of a phone repair shop, finally registered the weight.

He stared at the common room. The bookshelf -- the same bookshelf that had been there since his first day, the spines of abandoned paperbacks leaning against each other like drunks at a bar: *Shantaram*, *The Alchemist*, three copies of *Lonely Planet Southeast Asia*, a water-damaged *Harry Potter*. The TV on the wall, playing something in Malay he couldn't follow. The red lanterns hanging from the ceiling, their warm light making everything amber and soft, the light of a place that felt safe because it was designed to feel safe, because the lanterns and the velvet and the bookshelf were the set dressing of a hostel that wanted you to feel at home while you were very, very far from it. And there, beside the reception counter, the noticeboard -- the cork rectangle where Mei Ling pinned bus schedules and tour flyers and house rules, and where, weeks ago, Priya had pinned a printed sheet: the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, Section 39B, the relevant passage highlighted in yellow, the words MANDATORY DEATH PENALTY in bold. The sheet was gone now. Someone had taken it down -- Mei Ling, perhaps, or Uncle Razak, or the natural entropy of a hostel noticeboard that consumed documents the way the building consumed guests, silently, continuously, without record. The sheet was gone but the law was still there, the law was always there, the law did not require a printout to exist.

The machine tried to run. He could feel it trying -- the gears engaging, the mechanism reaching for raw material, the rationalisation engine attempting to convert the back room and the scale and the vacuum bags into something manageable. But the gears found nothing. The gears spun in empty space, producing no traction, no output, no product. The machine had run out of material. The tissue paper was gone. The *I don't know for certain* was gone, burned up in the fluorescent light of Wei's back room where the certainty had been laid out on a stainless steel table like evidence in a courtroom. The machine ran and produced silence, and the silence filled the space where the rationalisations used to be, and the silence was louder than any of them, because silence was the sound of a man who had nothing left to tell himself.

He sat there for an hour. The hour passed the way hours pass in hospital waiting rooms -- not in minutes but in breaths, each breath a unit of time that carried no information and offered no progress, the clock on the wall moving but the situation remaining exactly the same. Guests moved through the common room -- a Dutch couple heading out with daypacks, a solo traveler collecting laundry from the courtyard line -- and none of them saw him, or if they saw him they saw a backpacker sitting in a chair staring at a wall, and that was not unusual, that was not alarming, that was the posture of jet lag or a hangover or a bad night's sleep, the universal hostel posture of a person waiting for something to pass.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

Priya found him there. She came down the narrow staircase from the third floor, her braid over one shoulder, her round glasses pushed up on her forehead the way she wore them when she'd been reading, and she saw his face and she saw his hands and she stopped in the doorway of the common room and stood very still for a moment, the way a person stands when they see something they've been expecting and dreading in equal measure. Then she crossed the room and sat on the arm of the chair and put her hand on his shoulder and said nothing, because sometimes nothing was the right thing to say, the only thing to say, the thing that allowed a person to break in the presence of another person without the breaking being observed or narrated or fixed.

She held him. He let her hold him. And in the holding, in the silence, in the warm amber light of the common room, something gave way. Not the wall -- the wall held, the wall would hold for a few more days, the wall was stronger than love and stronger than fear and stronger than truth. But something behind the wall shifted, the way tectonic plates shift before an earthquake -- a deep, slow, grinding movement that was not yet a break but was the precondition for a break, the mechanical prerequisite for the moment when everything would move at once and the landscape would change and the man who had been carrying packages would become the man who had carried packages, and the difference between the two was everything.

"I went to Wei's shop," Connor said. His voice was quiet. Flat. The voice of a man reporting something he'd seen rather than something he'd done -- the voice of a witness, not a participant, the dissociation already active, the self splitting from the body that had carried the box. "The back room. There's a--" He stopped. Started again. The details came in the wrong order, the way a person describes a car accident -- the aftermath first, then the impact, then the moments before, the chronology scrambled by the force of what had happened. "There's a scale. Digital. Like a kitchen scale but -- no. There's a table first. Stainless steel. And on the table there's cling film and vacuum bags and a vacuum sealer and tape and scissors and-- Priya, there are boxes. Charger boxes. The same boxes. The same--" He stopped again. "It's not a phone shop, Priya."

She held him tighter. Her arms were around his shoulders and the jade bracelet -- the one Connor had bought her at the Petaling Street night market, the one she wore on her left wrist because her mother had told her jade should sit over the pulse -- was cool against his collarbone, and the coolness was the opposite of everything else, the opposite of the fluorescent heat of Wei's back room and the Saturday sun on Bukit Bintang and the warm dopamine of the RM500 notification. Her arms were the temperature of safety and Connor leaned into them the way a drowning man leans into a current that might carry him to shore or might not, the leaning itself the only act available.

"I know," she said.

"I've known for a while. I think I've always known."

"I know that too."

The common room was quiet. The ceiling fans turned. On the TV, a news broadcast in Malay showed footage of a police operation -- officers in blue, a table of seized drugs, a man in handcuffs being led to a van. Connor watched the footage and the footage watched him back.

"What do I do?" he said.

It was the first time he'd asked. In five weeks of warnings and arguments and printed laws and photographs and proverbs and business cards, it was the first time Connor Briggs had looked at someone who loved him and asked for help.

Priya's answer was immediate. She spoke the way she spoke about medicine -- in protocol, in steps, the voice of a fourth-year medical student who had been trained to convert crisis into procedure, to replace panic with sequence, to impose order on the body's chaos. "You stop. Right now. Today. No more deliveries. No more packages. No more Felix."

"And then?"

"And then we call Sergeant Ahmad. You tell him everything -- the routes, the names, the drop points, Wei's shop, the back room. You cooperate fully. Voluntary disclosure before arrest is the strongest position you can be in." She was thinking aloud now, the plan assembling itself in real time, the medical student's mind doing what it was trained to do: triage, prioritise, act. "Then we get to KLIA. Tonight. There's a midnight flight to Melbourne on Malaysia Airlines and a six AM to London on Qatar. We get on whichever one leaves first. You fly to Melbourne, I fly to London, and once we're out of the country you contact the Australian High Commission from outside Malaysian jurisdiction. You tell them everything you told Ahmad. You get a lawyer. A real one, not a hostel recommendation."

The plan was clear. The plan was specific. The plan had five steps and each step was possible and each step led to the next and the final step led to a life in which Connor Briggs was alive and free and answering questions in a room with a lawyer instead of a room with a fluorescent tube and a scale. The plan was the thing that would save his life, the open door at the end of a burning corridor, the exit that was still accessible, still functional, still available to a man who was willing to walk through it.

Connor looked at the door. He looked at Priya. He looked at his hands, which had carried things he'd never opened and were now shaking in the amber light.

"Okay," he said.

Priya's eyes widened. The word -- *okay* -- was the word she'd been waiting for since the night she'd printed the law. The word was yes. The word was agreement. The word was the sound of a man finally, finally, choosing to save himself.

"Okay," she said. "I'll help you. Right now. We'll call Ahmad together."

She reached for her phone. Connor reached for his wallet -- the wallet with the business card, the card that said NARCOTICS DIVISION, the card that was the lifeline, the card that had been waiting.

His burner phone buzzed.

The sound came from his left pocket -- the Nokia, the burner, the work phone, the phone that existed in a parallel jurisdiction from the iPhone in his right pocket. The two phones sat on opposite sides of his body like two identities separated by a spine, the personal and the professional, the curated life and the criminal one, and the buzzing came from the criminal side, the left side, the side closest to his heart, which was a coincidence of pocket placement that felt, in this moment, like architecture.

Felix.

*Need to see you. Rooftop. Now. Important.*

Connor looked at the phone. He looked at Priya. The two options sat before him -- the business card and the burner phone, the lifeline and the chain, the future and the past.

"I should see what he wants," Connor said.

Priya's face changed. The change was not dramatic -- she was not a person who performed her emotions, not a person who widened her eyes or opened her mouth or made the gestures that fear was supposed to make. The change was smaller and worse: a closing. A withdrawal. The light in her eyes -- the specific, fierce, medical light that had been there while she outlined the plan, the light of a person who believed the crisis could be managed -- went out. Replaced by something flat and knowing. The expression of a woman watching someone she loved choose to drown, the expression of a doctor watching a patient refuse treatment, the grief of someone who has offered the cure and watched the hand reach for the poison instead.

"No. Connor. No."

"Just to hear what he has to say. Then I'll call Ahmad. I promise."

"You promise." She said it the way you'd say the name of something that had stopped existing. "Connor, if you go to that rooftop, you won't call Ahmad. You know you won't. You'll talk yourself out of it. You always do. Felix will smile, and you'll find a reason, and tomorrow you'll be carrying another package."

She was right. She was right the way a diagnosis is right -- clinically, absolutely, in a way that the patient can acknowledge intellectually while still refusing to act. Connor knew she was right. He knew it the way he knew the packages weren't phone accessories and the boxes weren't chargers and Felix wasn't a photographer. He knew it, and knowing was not enough, because knowing required action, and action required breaking the only structure he had, and the structure -- the schedule, the money, Felix's approval, the warm, poisonous illusion of belonging -- was the only thing between him and the void.

"Five minutes," he said. "That's all. Then I'll call."

He stood. He put the wallet -- with the card, with the lifeline -- back in his pocket. Right side. He put the burner phone in the other pocket. Left side. The two objects resumed their positions, separated by his body, the choice deferred, the architecture of indecision restored. He walked to the staircase -- the narrow staircase, the one where two people could not pass, the one that funnelled a person upward through the building's dark interior toward the rooftop where Felix waited. The staircase that was too narrow for Priya to follow even if she wanted to, which she didn't, because following was not what you did when someone chose the wrong door. You stood and watched. You stood and watched and you remembered the plan you'd made -- the five steps, the midnight flight, the lawyer, the life -- and you folded it up and put it away in the place where the things that almost happened went to wait.

Priya did not follow. She sat in the armchair and watched him go and felt the fracture between them widen into something she recognised from her orthopaedics rotation -- not a stress fracture anymore but a complete break, the kind where the two halves could not be held together by anything short of surgery, and Connor would not consent to surgery. It had been broken since the first envelope, and everything since had been the two of them standing on opposite sides of the break, reaching across, their fingers almost touching but never quite connecting.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. The rooftop door opened. Felix was there.

And the next chapter began.
# Chapter 21: The Noose

Felix was standing at the railing, silhouetted against the city, and the city behind him was beautiful the way all traps were beautiful -- illuminated, inviting, designed to draw you closer.

The Petronas Towers were silver-white against the darkening sky, the last light catching their cladding and throwing it back as something colder than warmth. Below, the grid of Petaling Street was beginning its nightly transformation -- the daytime market contracting, the night market expanding, the LED lights stringing to life in blue and white and orange. From the rooftop, the city looked manageable. From the rooftop, everything looked manageable. That was the rooftop's lie.

"Sit down, Connor." Felix's voice was calm. Not warm -- the warmth had been recalibrated in the past few days, rationed, deployed more sparingly, the way a declining empire conserves its resources. What remained was something more efficient: authority without performance, command without charm.

Connor sat. The plastic chair was damp with the evening's humidity. His hands were still trembling -- the aftershock of what he'd seen in Wei's back room, the aftershock of almost calling Ahmad, the aftershock of choosing this rooftop over that phone call.

Felix turned from the railing. He didn't sit. He stood, and the standing was deliberate -- the physical arrangement of a conversation in which one person held the power and the other held the chair.

"I know what happened today," Felix said.

The sentence sat in the air between them like something placed rather than spoken.

"Wei told me you went into the back room. He said you saw the workbench. The packaging materials. The scale." Felix's voice was even, measured, the voice of a man reading a report rather than making an accusation. "He said you looked. He said your hands shook. He said you took the charger box and left without speaking."

Connor said nothing. The machine tried to engage -- tried to produce a deflection, a denial, a smooth rationalisation that would restore the equilibrium -- but the machine was running on fumes and what it produced was silence, which was the most honest output the machine had ever generated.

"I understand," Felix said. "I do. You've seen things that are difficult to reconcile with what I've told you. The packaging, the scale, the weight. You're not stupid, Connor. You were never stupid. You were trusting, which is different, and trust was what made you valuable."

The word *valuable* landed like a coin on the zinc railing -- metallic, precise, its worth calculated in advance.

"I'm going to tell you the truth now," Felix said. "Because we've reached the point where the truth is more useful than the story."

He paced -- two steps left, two steps right, the compact movement of a man who thought on his feet. The scar on his eyebrow caught the city's ambient light.

"The packages you've been carrying contain methamphetamine. Crystal meth. The envelopes contained cash -- payment for previous shipments. The brown paper packages contained small quantities -- fifty, sixty grams. The sports bags contained larger quantities -- two hundred to four hundred grams. The backpack you took to Sentul contained approximately six hundred grams, divided into seven packets. The charger box you picked up today contained seventy-two grams."

He said the numbers the way a banker says interest rates -- factual, decimal, without the weight that the numbers carried in other contexts. In other contexts -- in courtrooms, in police reports, in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 -- these numbers were death sentences. In Felix's mouth, they were inventory.

Connor heard the numbers. The numbers entered his mind and arranged themselves in a column -- 50, 60, 200, 400, 600, 72 -- and the column had a total, and the total was a number that represented, in grams, the cumulative weight of everything he'd carried across KL in the past five weeks. The total was a number so far above the fifty-gram threshold that the threshold was irrelevant, a speed bump in a rearview mirror.

The machine tried. The machine made its best attempt -- tried to engage the rationalisation protocols, tried to find the gap in Felix's arithmetic, the decimal point in the wrong place, the unit error that would collapse the total back down to something survivable. But there was no gap. The arithmetic was clean. Felix had said the numbers the way you'd read items off a receipt, and Connor's mind was now performing the calculation it had refused to perform for five weeks: each delivery multiplied by the fifty-gram threshold, each multiplication producing a mandatory death sentence, fourteen deliveries producing fourteen death sentences that were really one death sentence carried fourteen times by a man who had thought he was carrying phone accessories and import-export samples and things that didn't need names because names would have required questions and questions would have required answers and the answers were in Felix's mouth right now, numbered and weighed and delivered with the flat precision of a man reading inventory. He had carried death sentences like groceries. He had slung them over his shoulder in a daypack next to a water bottle and a copy of *The Beach*. The machine searched for something to say about this and the machine produced nothing, because the machine had been built to process ambiguity and there was no ambiguity left.

"Why are you telling me this?" Connor's voice was hoarse. The voice of a man who has been breathing the wrong air.

"Because you already know. You've known since the back room. Maybe longer. And because what happens next depends on whether we're honest with each other."

Felix stopped pacing. He stood in front of Connor -- close, two metres, the distance of a conversation between friends, the distance of a conversation between a handler and his asset.

"Here's the situation, Connor. You have been carrying methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur for five weeks. Fourteen individual deliveries. Multiple locations, multiple contacts. Your face is on CCTV at every pickup and every drop -- Wei's shop has cameras, the hostel has cameras, Mr. Tan's building has cameras, the Sentul warehouse has cameras. Your fingerprints are on every package -- the paper, the nylon, the tape. Your phone -- the work phone I gave you -- contains a record of every instruction, every address, every confirmation. Your bank account contains RM14,000 in deposits that cannot be explained by social media consulting."

Each sentence was a brick. Felix was building a wall, and the wall was around Connor, and the wall was made of evidence, and the evidence was irrefutable because the evidence was real -- it was the trail that Connor had left, delivery by delivery, transfer by transfer, the breadcrumb trail of a man walking into the forest who had never looked back to see what the breadcrumbs spelled.

"If I go to the police--" Connor started.

"If you go to the police, you are confessing to drug trafficking. The CCTV footage, the fingerprints, the phone records, the bank deposits -- they are evidence against *you*. Not against me. I'm not on those cameras. My name is not in your phone -- you have a number, not a name. My fingerprints are not on the packages -- I wear gloves, Connor. I have always worn gloves."

The word *gloves* detonated in Connor's mind. Felix had worn gloves. Felix had always worn gloves. The thin leather driving gloves he wore when handling the packages -- Connor had noticed them, had even commented once ("Bit fancy for KL, mate"), and Felix had laughed and said something about eczema, and Connor had accepted it because accepting was what he did, because accepting was the machine's fuel, because not accepting would have required a question and the question would have required an answer and the answer was *I'm wearing gloves so my fingerprints aren't on the drugs I'm giving you to carry*.

He could see the gloves now. He could see them with a clarity that was almost hallucinatory -- the soft brown leather, the stitched seams, the way Felix pulled them on before touching any package, every time, without exception, the gesture so practised it had looked like habit rather than protocol. Connor had stood there with his bare hands, his fingerprints pressing into paper and nylon and packing tape, his skin leaving its signature on every surface, and two metres away Felix had been wearing gloves and the gloves were the moat between Felix and the evidence and the moat had been visible the entire time and the machine had looked at the moat and called it eczema. The machine had encountered the single most incriminating detail in five weeks of incriminating details and had filed it under *personal quirk* and moved on, because the truth the gloves contained was too large, too precisely engineered, and processing it would have required dismantling the entire architecture of denial that kept Connor walking and carrying and sleeping at night.

"You set me up," Connor said.

"I prepared you." Felix's correction was gentle, almost kind, the way a teacher corrects a student's misunderstanding. "There's a difference. Setting up implies malice. I'm a professional. What I did was build a system in which you operate efficiently and I operate safely. That's not malice. That's design."

"You designed this. From the first day."

"From the first evening. Common room. You were broke, you were lonely, you were desperate to belong. You told me within twenty minutes of meeting me that your bank balance was critical, your parents supported you, and you'd do anything to avoid going home. You gave me your vulnerability like a gift. I would have been negligent not to use it."

The honesty was devastating. Not because it was cruel -- Felix delivered it without cruelty, without satisfaction, without the sadism that movie villains displayed when revealing their plans. He delivered it the way an engineer explains a mechanism: here is the design, here are the inputs, here is the output. The cruelty was in the accuracy, not in the delivery. Connor sat there and heard his own loneliness described as an engineering input, his desperation quantified as a resource, his need to belong catalogued as a vulnerability that had been identified and exploited with the same clinical detachment with which Wei weighed grams on the digital scale. He had been assessed. On that first evening, on this very rooftop, with the beers and the towers and the feeling of arrival -- he had been assessed, the way a locksmith assesses a lock, and Felix had found the mechanism simple.

Connor sat in the plastic chair and felt the last wall collapse. Not the rationalisation wall -- a different wall, the wall between the person he'd believed himself to be and the person he actually was. The person he'd believed himself to be was a traveler, an adventurer, a free spirit making unconventional choices. The person he actually was sat in a plastic chair on an illegal rooftop in Kuala Lumpur, having been told by his handler that he was a drug mule, that the evidence was irrefutable, that the exit was sealed.

"What do you want?" Connor said.

"One more job." Felix sat down now -- across from Connor, chair to chair, the posture of equals, though they were not equals and had never been. "One final delivery. Bigger than the others. After that, you're done. I release you. The work phone disappears. The schedule ends. You go to Langkawi, or London, or Melbourne, or wherever. Free."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I have no reason to protect you. The CCTV footage, the phone records, the bank transfers -- they exist whether you cooperate or not. Right now, they're contained. They're in systems I have access to. If you refuse, I have no incentive to keep them contained."

The threat was precise and bloodless, delivered without raised voice or menacing gesture, the way all professional threats were delivered -- as information rather than intimidation, as cause and effect rather than violence.

"You'd turn me in."

"I'd step aside. The footage exists. The records exist. If the police find them, they find them. I wouldn't need to do anything except stop protecting you."

Connor stared at Felix. Felix stared back. The city hummed behind them. The Petronas Towers watched. And between two men on a rooftop, the last pretence of friendship dissolved like sugar in water, leaving only the mechanism beneath -- clean, functional, and utterly without mercy.

"One job," Connor said. "Then I'm done."

"Then you're done."

"What is it?"

Felix smiled. Not the warm smile, not the charming smile, not the smile that had recruited Connor in the common room five weeks ago. This smile was thinner, more efficient, the smile of a man who had received the answer he expected.

"A suitcase," Felix said. "KL to Penang. By bus. I'll give you the details when the time comes."

"When?"

"Soon. A few days. I'll tell you when."

He stood. The conversation was over. The rooftop was dark now, the city's light the only illumination, the Petronas Towers the only vertical structure that mattered. Felix walked to the door.

"Connor."

"Yeah."

"Don't contact the police. Don't contact the embassy. Don't tell Priya. Don't tell anyone. If you do, the footage surfaces. And the footage, by itself, without my testimony, without context, is a death sentence. You understand that."

"I understand."

Felix nodded. The nod was the period at the end of a sentence that had been five weeks in the writing. He opened the door and descended the staircase and his footsteps were quiet and the third step did not squeak and the door to his room on the third floor opened and closed and the building absorbed his absence the way it absorbed everything -- silently, completely, without judgement.

Connor sat on the rooftop alone. The city was below. The sky was above. And between them, in a plastic chair on an illegal structure, a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had wanted nothing more than to avoid going home had just agreed to carry a suitcase full of methamphetamine from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, on a bus, through a country that would kill him for it.

The sounds of Petaling Street rose around him -- the night market winding down, the vendors folding tarps and stacking crates, the clatter of metal poles being disassembled. A motorcycle engine started somewhere below, coughed, caught, and joined the traffic's hum. From three streets away, the tinny pulse of a karaoke bar bled through the air, someone singing a Cantonese ballad off-key, the melody drifting upward and dissolving before it reached the rooftop. The Guan Di Temple was closing -- he could hear the iron gate rolling shut, the sound of metal on concrete that he'd learned to recognise as the city's evening punctuation, the full stop at the end of the market day. These were the sounds he'd loved when he first arrived. These were the sounds of the first evening on this rooftop, the evening Felix had produced two Tigers from somewhere and handed one to Connor and stood at the railing and pointed to the Petronas Towers and said, *Beautiful, isn't it*, and Connor had felt the vast, bright, uncomplicated happiness of a man who had arrived somewhere and believed the arriving was enough. The beer had been cold. The towers had been silver. The city had stretched below them like a promise, and Connor had thought, *This is it, this is the life*, and Felix had been standing exactly where he'd stood tonight, the same railing, the same silhouette, and the difference between that evening and this one was everything, was the distance between the man who arrives and the man who cannot leave.

The sweat on his skin was cooling. The night air moved across the rooftop -- not cold, never cold in KL, but cooler than the air his body was producing, and the differential registered as a chill -- the body's heat retreating inward to protect something vital while the skin went damp and expendable.

He didn't cry. He didn't scream. He didn't call Ahmad. He sat in the dark and felt the particular stillness of a man who has reached the bottom of something and found that the bottom was not solid ground but water, and the water was rising.

The business card was in his wallet. The burner phone was in his pocket. Both options were still there. Both doors were still open. But Connor had walked through one and the other was closing, inch by inch, and the closing was not something being done to him but something he was allowing, the way you allow a door to close by standing still, by not reaching for the handle, by watching it swing shut with the quiet click of something final.

The ceiling fan would be turning in Bed 7 when he got there. The blue towel would be under his pillow. The name would be on the bed frame. And in the morning, the call to prayer would come at 5:32, and the city would ask its question, and Connor would not answer, because Connor had stopped answering a long time ago, and the silence was the answer, and the answer was the end.
# Chapter 22: Priya vs Felix

Priya waited in the common room until eleven forty-seven PM, and when Connor came down from the rooftop his face told her everything his mouth would not.

She had been sitting in the armchair -- her armchair, the one with the sunken left cushion and the coffee stain shaped like Madagascar that someone had tried to cover with a throw pillow. She had been reading the same paragraph of her Lonely Planet for forty minutes, the words refusing to resolve into meaning, because meaning was upstairs on the rooftop where a German man was doing something to the Australian man she loved, and the doing was not physical but the damage would be.

She had been timing him. Five minutes, he'd said. Five minutes and then he'd call Ahmad. She had given him five, then ten, then twenty, then the twenty became thirty and the thirty became an hour and the hour was the shape of a lie -- not a malicious lie, not even a conscious lie, but the structural lie of a person who had said *five minutes* because saying it made the going possible and the going was what the machine required.

At eleven forty-seven, the staircase creaked -- the third step, the one that always announced arrivals like a sentry that had been bribed but still showed up for work. Connor descended into the amber light of the common room and Priya looked up from Madagascar and saw his face and the face was a ruin.

Not a dramatic ruin. Not tears, not rage, not the cinematic collapse of a man receiving terrible news. The ruin was subtler and therefore worse -- a draining, a vacancy, an emptiness -- the usual expressions evacuated, the surface technically still a face but no longer quite animated by the person behind it. His eyes were open but unfocused. His mouth was slightly ajar, the lower lip slack. His skin, bronzed by five weeks of tropical sun, had acquired a greyish undertone, the skin of a man whose blood had redirected itself inward, away from the surface, toward the organs that required it most.

He looked at Priya. She looked at him. The common room was empty except for the two of them and the gecko that lived behind the TV, whose intermittent clicking was the building's smallest heartbeat.

"What happened?" she said.

Connor shook his head. The headshake was minimal, economical, the gesture of a man conserving energy because energy had become finite. He walked past her armchair, past the coffee table with its abandoned magazines and someone's half-finished crossword, toward the staircase that led to the dorms.

"Connor."

He stopped. He didn't turn.

"It's bad," he said. His voice was flat. Not the breezy Australian flatness that was his default register, the she'll-be-right flatness that treated the world as a minor inconvenience. This was a different flatness -- the flatness of a man who had been emptied and was reporting from inside the empty.

He went upstairs. Priya heard his footsteps on the second-floor landing, the creak of the dorm door, the rustle of a man climbing into a bunk and pulling a thin sheet over himself like a membrane between his body and the world.

She sat in the armchair. She looked at the staircase. She looked at the ceiling, which was the floor of the dorm, which was the underside of the bunk where Connor was lying in the dark with whatever Felix had told him.

And then Priya Sharma made a decision.

The decision was not impulsive. Priya did not make impulsive decisions -- she was a fourth-year medical student at King's College London, trained to assess, diagnose, and act in sequence, trained to trust the evidence rather than the emotion, trained to cut when cutting was required and wait when waiting was better. The decision she made at 11:53 PM in the common room of the Lantern Hostel was a diagnostic decision: the patient was deteriorating, the current treatment (warnings, evidence, appeals) had failed, and the next step was to address the pathogen directly.

Felix was the pathogen. Felix was on the third floor. Priya was going to the third floor.

She stood. She straightened her glasses -- the round frames, the nervous gesture, the small act of preparation that preceded every difficult thing she'd ever done, from anatomy practicals to her brother's A-level results night to the night she'd told her mother she was traveling alone through Southeast Asia and her mother had looked at her with an expression that combined pride and terror in equal measure and said *beta, please be careful with your heart*.

The staircase was narrow. She climbed it in the dark, one hand on the wall, the wood cool and slightly damp beneath her fingers. The hostel at midnight was a different building from the hostel at noon -- the red lanterns were dimmer, their glow reduced to a low throb, and the air well funnelled the sounds of the city upward in a column of distant traffic and the occasional motorcycle and, beneath everything, the deep hum of a tropical night -- not silence at all but insects and ventilation and the breathing of thirty-odd people asleep in their bunks.

She passed the second floor. Dorm 3's door was closed. Connor was in there, in Bed 7, under the sheet, with Lena's name scratched into the frame he'd never read.

Third floor. The corridor was shorter up here -- two dorms, two private rooms, one bathroom. The bathroom light was on, leaking under the door, the perpetual fluorescent vigil that bathrooms in hostels maintained regardless of occupancy, as though the light itself was waiting for someone who would never arrive. Dorm 4 was quiet. Dorm 5 was quiet. Tomoko was in there somewhere, sleeping with the disciplined efficiency of a woman who had trained herself to rest in difficult places.

Private Room 1. Felix's door.

The door was wood, painted cream, the paint cracking in the humidity. A small brass number -- 1 -- was screwed to it at eye level, the screw slightly loose, the number tilted fifteen degrees clockwise, giving the impression of an address that had given up on precision. No light showed beneath the door. No sound came from within.

Priya knocked.

The knock was three sharp raps -- the clinical knock, the doctor's knock, the knock that says *I am here with purpose and the purpose does not require your permission*. She had learned this knock in her third year, on the wards, where hesitation was interpreted as incompetence and softness was interpreted as uncertainty, and where the patients who needed you most were the patients least likely to invite you in.

Silence. Then movement -- the creak of a bed frame, the soft pad of bare feet on tile, the particular rustle of a man who had been awake despite the darkness, who had been lying in bed in the dark the way predators lie in the dark, not sleeping but processing, calibrating, preparing for what came next.

The door opened.

Felix stood in the doorway. He was wearing a white linen shirt, unbuttoned, over dark cotton trousers. His feet were bare. His close-cropped hair was undisturbed -- the hair of a man who had not been sleeping, who had been lying on his back with his hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling, running calculations. The scar on his left eyebrow caught the bathroom's fluorescent bleed from down the corridor.

"Priya." He said her name the way he always said names -- precisely, with the slight emphasis on the first syllable that made the naming feel like a gift, an acknowledgement, as though the mere fact of being called by Felix Decker was a privilege the called should appreciate. "It's late."

"I need to talk to you."

He studied her. The study was brief -- two seconds, three -- but thorough, the way a diagnostician studies a patient (she recognised it, she did it herself), cataloguing the physical data: her posture (rigid, shoulders back, the stance of confrontation), her breathing (controlled, deliberate, the breathing of someone managing their adrenaline), her hands (at her sides, not clenched, not trembling, steady -- and this, she knew, would interest him most, because steady hands meant resolve, and resolve in a visitor at midnight was a more complex variable than fear).

"Come in," he said. He stepped aside. The invitation was delivered without hesitation, which was itself a kind of threat -- the ease of a man who feared nothing from the person at his door, the casual openness of someone who controlled the room regardless of who occupied it.

Priya entered.

Private Room 1 was small -- three metres by four, the dimensions of a generous cell or a modest bedroom, depending on your frame of reference. A single bed against the wall, neatly made, the sheet pulled taut with military precision. A wooden desk, empty except for a leather toiletry bag and a paperback -- Goethe, in German, the spine cracked at the midpoint. A window facing the air well, shutters open, the warm night air moving through the room in a slow, humid current. No decorations. No photographs. No evidence of personality. The room was occupied but not inhabited, the room of a man who kept his identity in his pocket rather than on his walls.

And on the desk, beside the Goethe, a small electric kettle and two ceramic cups.

"Tea?" Felix said. He was already filling the kettle from a bottle of water. "I have chamomile and green. The chamomile is quite good -- I brought it from Hamburg."

The offer was perfect. That was the horror of it. A woman had come to his room at midnight with confrontation in her posture and accusation in her eyes, and Felix Decker's first response was to offer her tea with the warm efficiency of a host who had been expecting this visit and had prepared for it the way he prepared for everything -- calmly, completely, with all the tools arranged in advance.

"I don't want tea."

"You might. These conversations are better with tea." He plugged the kettle in. It began to hum. "Please, sit." He gestured to the single chair, a wooden chair with a woven rattan seat that belonged to the desk. He sat on the edge of the bed, cross-legged, his bare feet folded beneath him, the posture of a man settling in for a conversation he expected to win.

Priya did not sit. She stood between the door and the desk, equidistant from each, the positioning instinctive -- a clinical placement, exit accessible, body angled to allow retreat. She had learned spatial awareness in her A&E rotation, where patients sometimes became threats and the distance between you and the door was the distance between safety and harm.

"What did you tell Connor?"

Felix smiled. The smile was small, controlled, the calibrated expression of a man who had many smiles and selected them the way a surgeon selects instruments -- each one designed for a specific incision. This smile said: *I appreciate the directness. I will now match it.*

"I told him the truth. Which is more than most people in his life have done."

"The truth about what?"

"About his situation. His options. His future. The things that a friend tells a friend when the friend is in difficulty."

"You're not his friend."

"By what standard?" The kettle was beginning to heat. A faint steam rose from the spout, vapour in the humid air, barely visible. "I gave him employment when he was broke. I gave him structure when he had none. I gave him a sense of purpose in a life that was, frankly, purposeless. I've done more for Connor in five weeks than his parents did in twenty-seven years. Friendship is defined by action, Priya, not by sentiment."

The words were smooth, rehearsed, the verbal equivalent of Felix's linen shirt -- well-constructed, appropriate, concealing whatever was underneath. Priya recognised the technique. She had seen it in consultants on the wards, the senior doctors who could describe a terminal diagnosis in language so measured and well-crafted that the patient walked away feeling cared for rather than doomed. The technique was called *framing*. Felix was framing exploitation as friendship, the way a gilded frame turned a mediocre painting into something that looked like art.

"You gave him packages to carry," Priya said. "You gave him jobs that put him in contact with your suppliers and your buyers. You gave him a phone that tracks every instruction. You put his fingerprints on methamphetamine and his face on CCTV and now you've told him the truth, not because you care about the truth but because the truth is a weapon and you needed him to understand the size of the weapon you're holding."

She said this without raising her voice. The words were precise, clinical, delivered with the economy of a diagnosis -- each sentence a finding, the cumulative effect a picture that left no room for the patient's preferred narrative. She had been assembling this diagnosis for weeks, since the first afternoon she'd seen Connor carrying a package with the breezy, unbothered gait of a man who didn't know what he was holding. She had assembled it the way she assembled all diagnoses -- observation, pattern recognition, differential analysis, and the slow, grinding elimination of alternative explanations until only one remained.

Felix listened. He listened the way he did everything -- with full attention, his body still, his eyes on hers, the focus of a man who processed information professionally and was now processing Priya's words the way he processed market data, supply routes, risk assessments. He did not interrupt. He did not bristle. He did not perform offence. He listened, and the listening was the most frightening thing about him, because it meant he was not threatened.

The kettle clicked off. The water was boiled.

"Chamomile, then," he said. He stood, unfolded, moved to the desk with the unhurried precision of a man performing a ritual. He placed a teabag in each cup. He poured the water. The scent of chamomile rose into the room -- warm, floral, the scent of something designed to soothe, the olfactory equivalent of a lullaby, deployed in a room where no one should have felt soothed and where the deploying was itself an act of control.

He held a cup out to Priya. She did not take it. He set it on the desk beside her, the gesture carrying the message: *It's here when you want it. I am patient. I can wait.*

"You're a medical student," Felix said. He sat back on the bed. The chamomile steamed between his hands. "Fourth year. King's College London. Your father is a cardiologist at St Thomas'. Your mother runs a GP practice in Wembley. You have a younger brother, Arjun, who is applying to read law at UCL. Your visa status in Malaysia is a tourist visa, thirty days, currently on day nineteen, eleven days remaining. You are, in every measurable way, a person with something to lose."

He said this without threat. That was the craft -- the information was delivered the way a newscaster delivered facts, with the calm, neutral affect of someone reporting rather than warning. The threat was in the information itself, not in the delivery. The threat was in the specificity: he knew her father's hospital, her brother's name, her visa's expiry date. He had compiled a file. He had compiled a file the way he compiled files on everyone -- not because he planned to use it but because having it ensured he could.

Priya's hands stayed at her sides. Her pulse was elevated -- she could feel it in her wrists, in the radial artery, the accelerated rhythm of a sympathetic nervous system engaging its fight-or-flight cascade. Adrenaline. Norepinephrine. Cortisol. She catalogued the physiological response with the detachment of a clinician observing a stress reaction, and the cataloguing helped, because naming the chemicals gave her a framework and the framework gave her distance and the distance was what she needed to keep her voice level.

"Are you threatening me?"

"I'm providing context." Felix sipped his tea. "You want to help Connor. That's admirable. I understand it. But help is a complicated thing, Priya, and the help you're imagining -- going to the police, contacting the embassy, pulling Connor out of this -- would have consequences you haven't fully considered."

"Consequences for whom?"

"For everyone. For Connor, obviously -- the evidence exists, the CCTV footage, the fingerprints, the bank records. If the police become involved, the evidence becomes their evidence. I can't control what happens to it then. Connor would be charged. Trafficking. Mandatory penalty."

"Connor could cooperate. Provide testimony. Identify you."

"He could try." Felix's voice didn't change. It maintained its register -- the soft German-accented English, the measured cadence, the voice of reason deployed in the service of something unreasonable. "But testimony requires evidence that implicates someone other than the testifier. My name isn't in his phone. My fingerprints aren't on the packages. I don't appear on the CCTV footage in any compromising way. I'm a backpacker who stayed at the same hostel. The prosecution would have Connor -- on camera, carrying drugs, fingerprints confirmed -- and they would have his claim that a German photographer told him to do it. How do you think that plays in a Malaysian courtroom?"

He paused. The pause was theatrical, the pause of a man who had delivered this speech before or had rehearsed it so thoroughly that the delivery and the rehearsal were indistinguishable. He drank his tea. The chamomile scent thickened in the small room, mixing with the humid air from the open shutters and the faint, distant smell of Petaling Street's night-food vendors -- satay smoke and hot oil and the sweetish ferment of an open drain.

"Now consider the consequences for you," Felix continued. "You're a witness. If you go to the police, you become part of the investigation. Your visa status, your travel history, your relationship with Connor -- all scrutinised. Your medical career requires a clean criminal record, doesn't it? A DBS check? How does 'questioned in connection with a drug trafficking investigation in Malaysia' appear on a DBS check? I genuinely don't know the answer. But I imagine your father might."

The room was quiet except for the air well's ambient sounds -- the distant hum of the city, a motorcycle accelerating on Jalan Sultan, the click of the gecko from somewhere below, and now, arriving with the sudden shift in air pressure that Kuala Lumpur announced its storms with, the first low rumble of thunder.

Priya felt the air change. The humidity, already oppressive, thickened further, the way air thickened before a tropical downpour -- the molecules compressing, the barometric pressure dropping, the atmosphere becoming a physical substance you could almost grip. Through the shutters, the sky over the Petronas Towers had darkened from its usual night-glow amber to something deeper, bruised, the colour of old blood behind glass.

"You've thought about this," she said.

"I think about everything. It's my job."

"Your job is drug trafficking."

"My job is logistics. The product is incidental." He said this without irony, or with an irony so deep it had looped back around to sincerity, the irony of a man who had told himself a story about his own profession and believed it the way Connor believed his story about phone accessories -- not because the evidence supported it but because the alternative was a mirror he didn't want to face.

The thunder came again, closer. The room's shutters trembled. And then the rain began.

KL rain was not like London rain. Priya had grown up with London rain -- the grey, persistent drizzle, the rain that was more mood than event, the rain that fell sideways and never committed. Malaysian rain was a different species. It fell vertically and it fell completely, a wall of water that descended from the sky with the committed violence of something that had been building all day in the equatorial heat and was now releasing at once. The rain hit the zinc roof of the hostel's third floor with a sound like applause -- no, not applause, like static, like the sound between radio stations turned to maximum volume, a white noise that was simultaneously everywhere and nowhere, that filled the room and the corridor and the air well and the streets below with a roar that made conversation difficult and private.

The rain was useful. Priya understood this instantly. The rain was a wall of sound that contained their words, that kept them in this room, that made the conversation feel sealed, hermetic, a chamber in which two people could speak without the building hearing. Felix understood it too. She saw the flicker of awareness in his eyes -- the recognition of a gift from the weather, the professional's appreciation of an environmental advantage.

"Let me be clear about what I want," Priya said, raising her voice to be heard above the rain. The chamomile cup sat untouched on the desk, the surface of the tea vibrating with the percussion of water on zinc. "I want you to release Connor. Whatever hold you have on him -- the evidence, the threats, the final job -- I want you to let him go. He walks away. No consequences. You find someone else."

"Release him." Felix repeated the word as though tasting it, evaluating its components the way a sommelier evaluates a wine -- not with enjoyment but with professional assessment. "The word implies captivity. Connor isn't captive. Connor is free to walk out of this hostel at any time. He's free to call the police, free to call his embassy, free to fly home to Melbourne. No one is stopping him."

"Except the evidence you've told him you control."

"Evidence is not a chain. Evidence is information. Information exists regardless of what I do with it."

"You told him you'd let the evidence surface if he refused the final job. That's coercion."

"That's a conversation between two adults about the reality of their situation. I didn't create the CCTV footage. I didn't create the fingerprints. I didn't create the bank transfers. Connor did. By choosing to carry the packages, by choosing not to ask what was inside, by choosing, week after week, to walk through a city carrying drugs he pretended were phone chargers. The evidence is Connor's creation. I merely pointed out that it exists."

The logic was impeccable. That was the worst part. The logic was airtight, constructed with the precision of a legal argument, each premise true, each conclusion valid, the whole structure sound and terrible and designed to make the person listening feel that the victim was the author of his own destruction. And in some ways, the logic was correct. Connor had chosen. Connor had carried. Connor had not asked. The machine had run and the machine was Connor's machine and the fuel was Connor's willful ignorance.

But logic was not the same as morality. A system could be logically consistent and morally catastrophic. Priya knew this. She had studied medical ethics. She had read about the Tuskegee experiments, about informed consent, about the difference between a patient who chooses not to take medication and a doctor who fails to prescribe it. Connor's choices had been real, but they had been engineered -- manufactured by a man who understood vulnerability the way an oncologist understood tumour markers, who could identify the precise weakness in a person's structure and apply pressure there, gently, incrementally, until the structure bore the load he needed it to bear.

"You engineered his choices," Priya said. "You identified his weaknesses -- financial pressure, need for belonging, fear of going home -- and you exploited them systematically. That's not two adults making decisions. That's grooming."

Felix set his cup down. The gesture was precise, the ceramic touching the desk's surface without sound, the control of a man who never let objects make noise he hadn't authorised. His expression shifted -- not dramatically, not into anger or defensiveness, but into something cooler, more clinical, the expression of a professional whose time was being used on an argument he'd already won.

"Grooming." He tested the word. "That's a strong word. A medical word, perhaps. Or a legal one. Do you know what word a Malaysian prosecutor would use, Priya? Accomplice. Associate. Co-conspirator. You've been living in the same building as a drug trafficking operation for three weeks. You've been sharing meals with the courier. You've been sleeping with the courier. You've been warned about the operation -- by the receptionist, by the photojournalist, by your own instincts -- and you've remained. You've remained because you love him, which is sympathetic, but the law doesn't weigh sympathy. The law weighs proximity. And your proximity to Connor is zero metres."

The rain intensified. The zinc roof sang. Through the shutters, lightning cracked the sky open over the Petronas Towers, the flash turning the room momentarily white -- the walls, Felix's face, Priya's hands, the untouched chamomile, all bleached to the same flat, clinical white of a hospital corridor, a police station, a room where the colour had been removed because colour was a luxury and this was not a place for luxury.

Thunder followed -- three seconds after the flash, meaning the lightning was approximately one kilometre away, the storm directly overhead, the building a small, trembling thing beneath the weight of equatorial weather that did not care about the people inside it, that came and went according to its own schedule, indifferent to conversations and threats and the precise placement of ceramic cups.

"You're afraid," Felix said. "Good. Fear is useful. Fear is what Connor should have felt five weeks ago, when I asked him to carry an envelope and he said yes without asking what was inside. Fear is the appropriate response to this country's drug laws. But fear, applied correctly, can also be protective. You're afraid for Connor. Use that fear. Use it to keep quiet. Use it to let this play out. Use it to protect your career, your family, your future."

"I'm not afraid of you."

"I know. That's what concerns me." He said this without smiling. The charm had been removed now, stripped away like a layer of paint, revealing the surface underneath -- not ugly, not monstrous, just cold, the smooth, functional coldness of a system that operated without the friction of emotion. "Afraid people are predictable. They run or they freeze or they comply. Brave people are unpredictable. And unpredictable people in my line of work are... complications."

The word *complications* hung in the air. It was not a threat. It was a category -- a classification, the word a bureaucrat uses to describe a problem that has not yet been solved but has been identified and will, at some point, require solving.

"Let him go," Priya said. Her voice was steady. The rain was a wall around them, the room a box inside the wall, the conversation a smaller box inside the room. "Whatever the final job is, cancel it. Let him walk away. He won't go to the police -- he's too afraid. He'll leave KL. You'll never hear from him again."

Felix looked at her for a long time. The look was appraising, the look of a man evaluating a proposal against a set of criteria she couldn't see.

"No," he said.

The word was simple, final, unornamental -- the opposite of everything else Felix had said in this conversation, which had been complex and layered and designed to perform intelligence. The *no* was stripped of performance. It was the raw output of the mechanism, the answer that required no justification because justification was for people who needed approval and Felix needed nothing from Priya except her absence.

"The final job will happen. Connor will carry the suitcase. This is not negotiable. It's not negotiable because the schedule is set, the route is planned, the receiver is waiting, and the product has been packaged. Connor is a component. Components are not negotiable."

"He's a person."

"He's both. The two are not mutually exclusive." Felix stood. The conversation was ending. She could feel it -- the way a consultation ends when the consultant has delivered the diagnosis and the patient's response is no longer medically relevant. "Priya, I like you. I say that without agenda. You're intelligent, you're brave, you see clearly. These are qualities I admire. I am asking you, with genuine respect, to step back. Let this finish. In a week, it will be over. Connor will carry the suitcase, the suitcase will arrive, the money will be transferred, and everyone will go home. Including you."

"And if it doesn't go well? If he's caught?"

"Then the situation is no longer mine to manage. And your involvement -- however well-intentioned -- will make it worse for you, not better for him."

He picked up her untouched cup of chamomile. He poured it down the small sink in the corner of the room -- the private rooms had sinks, a luxury the dorms did not, a luxury that cost RM85 per night and included the privilege of solitude and running water and a door that locked from the inside.

"We're done," he said. Not unkindly. With the finality of a man closing a file.

Priya stood in the room and felt the rain on the roof and the lightning in the sky and the distance between what she wanted to do and what she could do, and the distance was the distance between being right and being powerful, and being right without being powerful was the specific, exquisite torment of every person who had ever watched someone they loved walk toward something that would destroy them and found that love, by itself, could not change the direction.

She walked to the door. She opened it. The corridor was dark, the bathroom light still leaking its fluorescent patience.

"Priya."

She turned.

Felix was standing by the window, his silhouette against the shutters, the rain beyond him a silver curtain lit intermittently by lightning. His face was in shadow. His voice, when he spoke, carried something that might have been, in a different man, regret.

"I told you your father is a cardiologist and your brother is applying to UCL. I didn't tell you how I know. Consider that."

The door closed. Priya stood in the corridor and the information detonated inside her with the delayed-fuse precision of something that had been placed rather than thrown -- the understanding that Felix had not simply Googled her, had not simply asked around, had compiled a file with details that required effort, that required access, that implied a network of information-gathering that extended beyond this hostel, beyond this city, beyond anything she had imagined when she'd climbed the staircase with her clinical confidence and her doctor's knock.

He knew about her family. He knew because knowing was what he did. And the knowing was the threat -- not a spoken threat, not a legal threat, but the ambient threat of being known by someone who used knowledge the way surgeons used scalpels, with precision and without sentiment.

The rain was still falling. The building was shaking with it, the old timbers vibrating, the zinc roof a drum, the air well a column of sound that amplified the storm into something elemental, something older than the building and the people inside it, something that cared about none of this.

Priya went downstairs.

---

She found Connor awake. He was sitting on the edge of Bed 7 in the dark, the dorm lit only by the glow of someone's phone charger -- a small blue LED, the size of a full stop, pulsing in the darkness like a heartbeat. The other bunks held sleeping travellers -- the regular turnover of two-night tourists who passed through the Lantern Hostel like weather, arriving and departing without consequence, their names already fading from the guest ledger before Mei Ling's ink was dry.

Priya sat beside him. The bunk was narrow -- two bodies on a single mattress, their shoulders touching, the proximity forced by architecture and chosen by need. Beneath Connor, the bed frame held Lena's name in its wood, the scratched letters invisible in the dark, the message from a previous occupant who had also trusted Felix and also learned the cost.

"I went to see Felix," she said.

Connor's reaction was immediate. His body tightened -- she felt it through the point of contact at their shoulders, the muscular tension of a man whose fear had been activated by a specific stimulus. He turned to face her. In the blue LED light, his eyes were wide, the pupils dilated, the sympathetic response she had catalogued in herself an hour ago now visible in him.

"You what?"

"I went to his room. I told him to let you go."

"Priya." The word was raw, scraped, the sound of a man hearing something that frightened him more than what Felix had said on the rooftop, because what Felix had said on the rooftop was about Connor's fate and this was about Priya's, and Connor's fear for himself had limits that his fear for her did not. "You can't -- he's not -- you don't understand what he --"

"I understand exactly what he is." Her voice was the clinical voice, the diagnosis voice, the voice that she deployed when the patient was panicking and the panic was justified but the panic would not help. "He's a trafficker who uses backpackers as mules and discards them when they're caught. He's meticulous, he's prepared, and he has no intention of releasing you from the final job."

"Did he threaten you?"

"He informed me. There's a difference, apparently." The dark humour was involuntary, the sardonic reflex of a person processing something terrible and reaching for the only tool available -- the scalpel of irony, the small, sharp instrument that let you cut the thing into pieces small enough to examine. "He knows about my family. My dad's hospital. Arjun's uni application. He's compiled a file."

Connor pressed his palms against his eyes. The gesture was the gesture of a man trying to hold something in or push something out, the physical equivalent of the machine's last, desperate rationalisation attempt -- except the machine was broken now, had been broken on the rooftop, and what remained was not a mechanism but a man, twenty-seven years old, sitting on a bunk bed in the dark in a city where the law was a wall and the wall was closing and the man who had built the wall was three floors above them, drinking chamomile and reading Goethe.

"We have to leave," Priya said. "Now. Tonight. We pack, we go to KL Sentral, we get on the first train to the airport, and we fly out. Singapore, Bangkok, anywhere. We leave and we don't come back."

"I can't."

"You can. There's nothing physically stopping you from walking out that door --"

"The evidence." Connor's voice was a whisper, the whisper of a man who had learned a new geography of fear and was still mapping its borders. "He told me everything, Priya. On the rooftop. The packages were meth. All of them. Every delivery I've made for five weeks -- methamphetamine. He told me the weights. He told me the totals. I've carried... the number is... it's thousands of grams. Thousands. And every pickup, every drop, there's CCTV. Every package has my fingerprints. The burner phone has every instruction. My bank account has fourteen thousand ringgit in deposits that trace back to the network."

He lowered his hands. In the blue light, his face was the face from the common room an hour ago -- drained, vacant, the face of a man reporting from inside the ruin.

"If I run, the evidence surfaces. Not from Felix -- he doesn't need to do anything. The footage exists. The records exist. He said he'd stop protecting me. That's all it takes. The police find the footage. My face, my fingerprints, the packages. And the amount... Priya, the amount is so far above the threshold that the threshold is meaningless. Fifty grams triggers the death penalty. I've carried thousands. Thousands of grams. Of methamphetamine. In Malaysia."

The rain was easing. The drumming on the roof was softer now, the storm passing eastward over the city, the thunder receding like retreating artillery, leaving behind the dripping aftermath -- water running through the gutters, pooling in the air well, the old building releasing the rain from its surfaces the way an animal shakes water from its coat.

"The card," Priya said. "Sergeant Ahmad's card. You still have it."

"I have it."

"Then we call him. We call him now. You turn yourself in. You cooperate. You give them Felix's name, Wei's name, the locations, the schedule -- everything. Voluntary cooperation. It has to count for something."

"Felix said it wouldn't. He said his name isn't in my phone. His fingerprints aren't on the packages. He's not on the CCTV. It would be my word against his -- a drug mule's word against a tourist's."

"Then we go to the Australian embassy --"

"And tell them what? That I've been trafficking methamphetamine for five weeks? That I've made fourteen deliveries? The embassy can't override Malaysian law. The embassy can't make the CCTV disappear. All the embassy can do is assign me a lawyer and the lawyer would tell me exactly what Felix already told me: the evidence is overwhelming, the sentence is mandatory, and no amount of cooperating changes the fact that I carried enough methamphetamine to qualify for the death penalty fifteen times over."

Priya was quiet. The quiet was not agreement -- it was the quiet of a diagnostician who has been presented with a case where every treatment has contraindications and the disease is progressing and the patient is sitting in front of her in the dark, waiting for the answer that she, with all her training and all her intelligence and all her love, did not have.

Because Connor was right. Not about everything -- not about the futility of cooperation, not about the embassy's impotence, not about the finality of the evidence. But about the shape of the trap. The trap was real. Felix had built it over five weeks with the patience and precision of an engineer, and the trap was not a cage with visible bars but a set of consequences that activated upon exit, a system in which every escape route triggered a worse outcome than staying, in which the only safe direction was forward, into the final job, into the suitcase, into the bus to Penang.

The trap was a funnel. And the funnel's narrow end was a highway checkpoint where the dogs would smell what the suitcase contained and the officers would open the lining and Connor would stand on the shoulder of the North-South Expressway while the traffic streamed past and the handcuffs closed and the world ended.

She didn't know this yet. She knew the shape, not the specifics. But the shape was enough to understand that the conversation in Felix's room had not been a negotiation but a notification -- the notification of a man who had already decided and was extending the courtesy of explaining the decision to the people who would be affected by it, the way a surgeon explains the procedure before performing it, the explanation not changing the outcome but making the outcome feel, briefly, participatory.

"He offered me chamomile tea," Priya said.

The sentence came from nowhere and went nowhere. It was a factual statement about a beverage. And yet, in the context of the conversation, in the dark of the dorm, on a night when a man had calmly explained why another man's life was forfeit and why a woman's interference would only add her to the casualty list, the sentence was also the most terrifying thing Priya had said, because it captured the thing about Felix that no amount of analysis could adequately describe: the normalcy of him. The politeness. The chamomile.

The worst people she had encountered in medical school were not the ones who raged or threatened or lost control. They were the ones who maintained perfect composure while delivering devastating news, who offered tea while explaining that your mother was dying, who smiled while signing the forms that committed you. Felix was that kind of person. Felix was the consultant who looked you in the eye and told you the prognosis was terminal and then asked if you'd like a biscuit.

Connor reached for her hand. She took it. Their fingers interlaced in the dark, the grip tight, the grip of two people holding on to each other because everything else was coming loose and the human hand was the only anchor available.

"I'm not leaving without you," she said.

"I know."

"And I'm not letting you carry that suitcase."

Connor said nothing. The silence was the sound of a man who wanted to believe what she'd said but knew, with the terrible new clarity that Felix's rooftop confession had given him, that wanting and believing were different operations and that believing, in this case, required a plan, and the plan required a way out, and the way out was the thing that did not exist.

The rain had stopped. The silence after a KL thunderstorm was always absolute -- a held breath, the city suspended in the aftermath, the gutters still running, the leaves still dripping, the air scrubbed clean and smelling of ozone and wet concrete and the vegetal sweetness of tropical plants released from the heat. Through the air well, the clouds were breaking. A single star appeared, then another, the sky reassembling itself with the casual efficiency of a city that had weathered this storm ten thousand times and would weather it ten thousand more.

In Bed 7, in Dorm 3, on the second floor of the Lantern Hostel, two people held hands in the dark and felt the shape of what was coming and did not speak because speaking required language and language required hope and hope was the thing that Felix Decker, on a rooftop and in a private room and in five weeks of careful, patient engineering, had methodically and completely removed.

The blue LED pulsed. The ceiling fan turned. And somewhere above them, on the third floor, a man drank the last of his chamomile tea and opened his Goethe to the bookmarked page and read in the clean, fluorescent-free darkness of his room, waiting for morning, waiting for the schedule, waiting for the component to perform its final function.

The storm moved east. The city dried. And the morning was coming, as mornings always came in KL -- sudden, bright, and merciless.
# Chapter 23: The Truth

The alarm on the burner phone went off at 7:15 AM, and Connor was already awake.

He had been awake since 4:47. He knew this because he had watched the time change on the cracked screen of his real phone -- the phone that connected him to Instagram, to his parents, to the curated fiction of @ConnorGoesGlobal -- and he had watched it the way a patient in a hospital watches the clock on the wall opposite their bed: not to track time but to confirm that time was still moving, that the world had not frozen in the configuration it had assumed on the rooftop two nights ago, that the seconds were still falling, one by one, into the void between what he had been and what he now was.

4:47. 4:48. 4:49.

The dorm was dark. The ceiling fan turned. Three other beds were occupied -- a Swedish couple in Beds 3 and 4 who had arrived yesterday and whose names Connor had already forgotten, and a Korean guy in Bed 1 who snored with a precision that suggested his respiratory system operated on a schedule. The air was warm and damp and smelled of damp wood and Tiger Balm and shared sleep gone stale -- the communal exhalation of strangers in a small room, the biochemistry of four bodies processing the night.

Bed 7. Connor's bed. The mattress that had been his for forty-one days. The thin foam under vinyl that his body had memorized, the way water memorizes the shape of whatever holds it. The blue travel towel was under his pillow -- the Sea to Summit microfiber that had been to twelve countries, that smelled faintly of sunscreen and the South China Sea, that he'd bought at a camping store in Melbourne four years ago when buying a travel towel had felt like the most adventurous thing he'd ever done.

He lay there and the truth lay with him.

That was the difference now. Before the rooftop -- before Felix's inventory, before the numbers, before the word *methamphetamine* was spoken aloud in Felix's precise, German-inflected English -- the truth had been something Connor kept in a separate room. A room with a door. A door with a lock. The machine had built the room and the door and the lock, and the machine had kept the truth contained, and the containment had allowed Connor to function -- to walk through KL with packages in his daypack and numbers in his phone and the distance between what he carried and what he knew maintained by the engineering of denial.

The room was gone. Felix had demolished it. The numbers were in the open now -- 50, 60, 200, 400, 600, 72 -- and the numbers didn't go back into the room because the room didn't exist anymore, and without the room, the numbers lived where Connor lived, in his conscious mind, in the space between his thoughts, in the air he breathed and the food he tasted and the water he drank. The numbers were permanent residents now. They had moved in and unpacked.

The call to prayer came at 5:32 from Masjid Jamek. The muezzin's voice threaded through the pre-dawn haze, through the air well, through the shuttered windows, into Dorm 3 where Connor Briggs lay on his back and listened to a summons to which he could not respond because the summons was for the faithful and he was not faithful to anything -- not to God, not to the law, not to Priya, not to himself.

He watched the ceiling fan turn. *Tick, tick, tick.* The blades were slightly warped and the wobble created a rhythm, a metronome for the sleepless, a clock that measured nothing but its own rotation.

At 7:15, the burner phone buzzed.

The message was from a number -- not a name, never a name, Felix's operational hygiene maintaining the distance between identity and instruction. The message read:

*Pickup at 9. Wei's. Charger box. Drop at Chow Kit, stall behind the wet market, Uncle Lim, blue awning. RM600. Use Grab.*

Connor read the message. His hands did not shake. This surprised him, the absence of the tremor -- a stillness that was not calm but its opposite, the stillness of a system that has moved beyond stress into a territory for which no physiological response exists, a flatness that the body produces when the mind has accepted something the body cannot process.

He was going to carry drugs today. Methamphetamine. Crystal meth. In a charger box from Wei's shop. To a stall in Chow Kit. For six hundred ringgit.

He knew this. He knew it with the full, terrible, luminous clarity of a man who has been told the truth by the man who trapped him, and the knowing was the thing that had changed, the knowing was the new variable, because the packages hadn't changed -- they were the same packages, the same weight, the same dimensions, the same vacuum-sealed contents -- but Connor had changed, and the change was that the distance between his hands and the truth was now zero.

He sat up in bed. Swung his legs over the side. His feet found the cracked encaustic tiles -- cool, slightly uneven, the original floor of a building that had been a merchant's home and a warehouse and a headquarters for men who interrogated other men and a gambling den and a brothel and was now a hostel, the latest use in a sequence of uses, each leaving its residue in the walls, the floors, the air. His feet knew this floor. His feet had walked this floor every morning for forty-one days, and the familiarity of the cool tile against his soles was the familiarity of a routine that had, until two days ago, felt like home.

He dressed. Board shorts -- the same ones, always the same ones, the uniform of the man he had been. A singlet that said BALI VIBES in faded letters across the chest. Flip-flops. The braided leather bracelet from the full moon party. The costume was the same. The actor inside it had been replaced.

---

Mama Siti was in the kitchen.

She was always in the kitchen. Connor had stopped questioning her hours, her permanence, the way she existed in the kitchen the way weather existed in the sky -- not as a presence but as a condition, an atmospheric fact. She was frying something. The wok was black and heavy and seasoned with decades of oil, and the thing she was frying was *ikan bilis* -- tiny dried anchovies that crackled and spat in the hot oil, their salt smell cutting through the morning's humidity like a blade through cloth.

"Morning," Connor said. The word came out flat. The breezy inflection that had been his default -- the upward lilt, the Australian warmth, the casual confidence that turned every greeting into an invitation -- was gone. What remained was the word itself, stripped of performance, a sound with no decoration.

Mama Siti looked at him. She looked at him the way she had been looking at him for weeks -- with an expression that was not pity and not judgement and not fear but something older than all three, something that lived in the eyes of people who had seen the pattern before and knew how the pattern ended.

"Nasi lemak?" she said.

"Yeah. Thanks."

She served it on a banana leaf. The rice was white and fragrant with coconut milk, the sambal was red and glistening, the anchovies were golden, the peanuts were toasted, the egg was fried with crispy edges, and the cucumber slices were cool and green. It was the same nasi lemak she made every morning, and it was perfect, and Connor looked at it and saw for the first time what it was -- not just food but a gift, a daily act of care from a woman who cooked for strangers in a building that consumed them, and the care was real and the consumption was also real and the nasi lemak existed at the intersection of the two, sustenance and farewell in the same banana leaf.

He ate. The sambal burned. The coconut rice was sweet. The egg was warm. He ate because his body required fuel and his body did not care about the truth -- his body operated on calories and hydration and sleep and the body's priorities were separate from the mind's crisis, the body a machine of a different order, a machine that would continue to function until something stopped it, a machine that had carried packages for five weeks without complaint because the body did not read the labels.

Mama Siti watched him eat. When he was finished, she took the banana leaf and said, in Malay, something he didn't understand. Her voice was quiet. The words were soft.

"Sorry?" Connor said.

She shook her head. "Nothing. Eat well today."

The way she said *today* -- with a weight, a specificity, as if today were different from other days, as if today required a different kind of eating, the eating of a man who did not know how many meals he had left -- stayed with Connor as he climbed the stairs to the second floor, as he brushed his teeth in the communal bathroom, as he looked at his face in the mirror and saw what Mama Siti had seen: a man who was already somewhere else, a man whose eyes had changed colour not literally but functionally, the light behind them dimmer, the focus different, the gaze of a person looking inward at a landscape that had been rearranged without his consent.

Wei's shop at nine. The bell above the door. The cramped interior with its archaeology of phone cases and charging cables and cracked screens. The smell of solder and dust and air that had gone flat, the stale-breath atmosphere of a room that never received direct sunlight.

Wei was behind the counter. He did not greet Connor. He had never greeted Connor. Greeting implied relationship, and their relationship was not the kind that warranted greeting -- it was transactional, functional, the relationship between a packaging facility and a delivery mechanism, each component performing its function without the ceremony of human connection.

He went to the back. He returned with a charger box. POWERMAX ULTRA FAST CHARGER -- USB-C/LIGHTNING -- 65W. Same brand. Same packaging. Same cellophane wrap. Same weight that was not the weight of a charger.

Connor took the box. He put it in his daypack -- the grey Osprey that had been to Vietnam and Cambodia and Bali and now carried methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur. The box settled next to his water bottle and his real phone and the copy of *The Beach* he was never going to read.

He left. The bell rang. The morning heat of Petaling Street met him at the door -- 31 degrees at nine fifteen, the humidity already at eighty percent, the air thick and wet, the sky white with haze, the city beginning its daily process of heating itself to the point of thunderstorm.

He walked toward Jalan Sultan. Past the market stalls that were setting up for the day -- the vendors unrolling tarps, stacking merchandise, hanging counterfeit bags and watches and shoes from hooks and ropes and the ingenuity of commerce. Past the Guan Di Temple, where incense smoke drifted through the open doors and the smell was sandalwood and ash and something older, the smell of five hundred years of prayer in a room built for prayer, the smoke carrying the petitions of the faithful into a sky that did not answer.

He walked and the daypack sat against his back, and the charger box was inside the daypack, and the methamphetamine was inside the charger box, and the truth was inside Connor, and the nesting was complete -- object inside object inside object inside the man who carried them all, a Russian doll of culpability, each layer smaller and harder and more concentrated than the last.

He ordered a Grab to Chow Kit. The app's interface was cheerful -- green and white, the little car icon moving toward his location, the driver's name (Hafiz, 4.8 stars, silver Myvi) appearing with the ETA (7 minutes). The normality of the app, its seamless integration into the fabric of daily life, its assumption that everyone who ordered a Grab was going somewhere ordinary for ordinary reasons -- this normality was the comedy and the horror, the two so intertwined that separating them would require a violence that neither genre could survive.

The car arrived. Connor got in. Rear seat, behind the driver. Daypack on his lap. The car smelled of vanilla air freshener and the faint chemical residue of the cleaning product Hafiz used on his seats. The radio was playing -- a Malay pop song, the singer's voice warm and rhythmic, the melody carrying the uncomplicated optimism of pop music, the belief that love was the biggest problem, that heartbreak was the worst thing, that a catchy chorus could contain the full range of human suffering.

"Chow Kit, ya?" Hafiz said, glancing in the rearview.

"Yeah, mate. Thanks."

The car pulled into traffic. Jalan Petaling to Jalan Sultan to Jalan Tun Perak. The city moved outside the windows -- motorcycles threading between cars, buses painted with advertisements for skin whitening cream and online casinos, pedestrians crossing against the light with the calm fatalism of people who had learned that traffic signals were suggestions rather than commands. A woman in a headscarf carrying a grocery bag. A group of construction workers in orange vests. A kid on a bicycle, no helmet, weaving through the cars with the invulnerability of youth.

Connor watched all of it and all of it was vivid and all of it was distant, the world behind glass, the glass of the car window and the glass of his own dissociation, the transparent barrier between a man who is present and a man who is somewhere else, a man who is sitting in the back of a silver Myvi with methamphetamine in his daypack and watching the city pass like a film he's already seen the ending of.

They turned onto Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman. The road was wider here, the shophouses giving way to larger buildings, the scale shifting from Chinatown's intimate compression to the broader, louder architecture of a commercial thoroughfare. Signs in Malay and Chinese and Tamil. Electronics shops with speakers blasting tinny music onto the pavement. Fabric stores with bolts of silk and cotton stacked in windows. The smell changed -- less incense, more diesel, less heritage, more commerce.

It was on Jalan TAR that the package tore.

---

Connor shifted the daypack on his lap. The movement was mundane -- a repositioning, the kind of unconscious physical adjustment that bodies make in confined spaces, the language of comfort in an uncomfortable seat. The daypack's main compartment was unzipped -- he'd left it open to access his water bottle -- and the shifting sent the contents sliding, the water bottle rolling against the charger box, the charger box pressing against the side of the bag, the cellophane wrap catching on the zip's teeth.

The sound was small. A crinkle. The particular sound of cellophane under tension, the plastic resisting and then not resisting, the wrap peeling away from the cardboard in a strip that was maybe two centimetres wide and four long. Not dramatic. Not a catastrophic failure. Just a small tear, a minor breach in the packaging's integrity, the kind of thing that would happen to any product in transit, the kind of thing that a customer would notice at home and shrug at and peel away and discard.

But the tear exposed the cardboard beneath the cellophane, and the cardboard was not intact.

The box had been opened and resealed. Connor could see it now -- the edge where the cardboard flap met the box's body, the line of adhesive that was not the factory's adhesive but something applied later, something thicker, more deliberate, the sealant of a second closure. The box had been opened to put something inside it and then closed to conceal what had been put inside, and the cellophane had been applied over the resealed box to restore the appearance of factory packaging, and the appearance had held until the zip's teeth had caught the wrap and peeled it back and revealed the seam.

Connor stared at the seam. The seam stared back.

His fingers moved. He did not decide to move them -- they moved the way a tongue moves toward a broken tooth, the compulsion of the body to investigate the thing it fears, to touch the damage, to confirm with the most sensitive instruments available -- the fingertips, the nerve endings, the million receptors per square centimetre of human skin -- that the damage is real.

His thumb pressed the cardboard flap. The adhesive was still tacky -- not fully cured, the glue applied recently, within hours. The flap lifted. Not much. A centimetre. Enough to create a gap between the flap and the box's body, a gap that admitted light and air and vision.

He looked inside.

The charger was there. The white plastic housing of a 65W USB-C/Lightning fast charger, exactly as depicted on the box's label. But the charger was lighter than it should have been because the charger had been hollowed out. The transformer, the voltage regulators, the circuit board -- the guts that gave a charger its weight and its function -- had been removed, and in their place was a plastic bag.

The bag was vacuum-sealed. The seal was professional -- tight, airless, the bag's plastic compressed against its contents the way cling film compresses against food, following every contour, every edge, every granular surface. The plastic was thick, industrial-grade, the kind used for long-term food storage or evidence preservation or the packaging of substances that needed to be protected from moisture and odour and the dogs that could smell what humans could not.

Through the plastic, Connor could see the contents.

White. Crystalline. Granular, but not uniformly -- some pieces were larger, some smaller, some the size of rock salt, some the size of coarse sugar. The crystals caught the light from the car window -- the white haze of a KL morning filtering through the Myvi's glass -- and refracted it, not brilliantly but dully, the way cheap glass refracts light, the way ice refracts light on a day when the ice is already melting. The substance was packed tight, compressed by the vacuum seal into a dense, flat rectangle that fit the charger housing with the precision of a component designed for the space, which it was -- not designed by an engineer but by Wei, at his stainless steel table, with his vacuum sealer and his scale and his boxes and his flat, expressionless face.

Methamphetamine.

The word formed in Connor's mind and the word was not new -- Felix had said it two nights ago on the rooftop, had said it with the banker's precision, had said it the way you say a product name in a quarterly review -- but the word on the rooftop had been abstract, linguistic, a signifier without a referent, a label for something Connor had not seen with his own eyes. Now the referent was in his hands. Now the label was attached to an object. Now the signifier and the signified were united, and the union was crystalline and white and weighed approximately seventy grams and was sitting in a hollowed-out charger box in a daypack on the lap of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in the back of a Grab on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a country that would sentence him to death for carrying it.

Connor closed the flap. His thumb pressed the adhesive. The flap resealed, not perfectly -- the cellophane was torn, the seam visible -- but enough to restore the box's silhouette, to return the charger to its disguise, to put the truth back inside the box even though the truth was now also outside the box, in Connor's mind, in his fingertips, in the chemical smell that had escaped the gap when the flap was open -- a faint, sharp, astringent smell, the smell of something that was not a charger and not phone accessories and not export documents but crystal methamphetamine, and the smell was in the car now, in the vanilla-scented air of Hafiz's silver Myvi, and the smell was real and the truth was real and the box was in Connor's lap and the panic arrived.

---

It began in his chest.

A tightening. Not pain -- not the crushing, cardiac pain of a heart attack, though his first thought was *heart attack* because his first thought was always the wrong thought, the thought that replaced the real threat with an imagined one, the machine's final gambit: *you're not having a panic attack because you're carrying methamphetamine through KL, you're having a heart attack, which is a medical emergency rather than a criminal one, and medical emergencies are treatable, which makes them preferable to criminal emergencies, which in this country are not.*

The tightening spread. From his chest to his throat. From his throat to his jaw. His jaw clenched -- the masseter muscles contracting involuntarily, the teeth grinding, the pressure building in his temples. His breathing changed. The exhales shortened. The inhales shallowed. The ratio between oxygen in and carbon dioxide out shifted, and the shift produced the first symptom: lightheadedness, the sensation of the world tilting, the car's interior rotating on an axis that was not the car's axis but Connor's vestibular system misfiring under the load of too much adrenaline in too small a body with too few exits.

His hands were sweating. The daypack's nylon was slick under his palms. He gripped it tighter and the gripping was counterproductive -- the tension in his hands fed the tension in his forearms which fed the tension in his shoulders which fed the tension in his chest which fed the tightening which fed the panic which fed the gripping. A loop. A circuit. The body's feedback mechanism running without a governor, each output becoming an input, each input amplifying the output, the system approaching resonance -- the frequency at which a bridge shakes itself apart, the frequency at which a wine glass shatters, the frequency at which a man in the back of a Grab begins to drown in air.

"You okay, boss?" Hafiz's voice came from the front seat, distant, the voice of a man on the other side of a wall.

"Fine." Connor's voice was strangled. The word came out compressed, the vowel squeezed, the consonants sharp, the sound of a man speaking through a closing aperture. "Just -- car sick. Bit car sick."

"Can open window," Hafiz said, and he pressed a button and the rear window hummed down and the air of Jalan TAR rushed in -- hot, diesel-scented, loud, the air of traffic and commerce and humanity, the air that ten million people breathed every day without thinking about what was in their lungs or their laps or their daypacks.

Connor breathed. The air helped. The air didn't help. The air was a variable that had no effect on the equation because the equation was not respiratory but existential -- the panic was not caused by insufficient oxygen but by the crystalline white substance in the charger box in the daypack on his lap, the substance his fingers had almost touched, the substance whose chemical smell was still in his nostrils, the substance that, if the police found it, would result in his arrest, his charge, his trial, his conviction, and -- under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 -- his death.

The traffic was moving slowly. The car crept. A bus beside them displayed an advertisement for a telecommunications company -- a young woman laughing, her hair perfect, her phone held aloft, the caption STAY CONNECTED in English and KEKAL TERHUBUNG in Malay. The woman in the advertisement was happy. The woman in the advertisement existed in a world where the worst thing that could happen was a dropped call.

Connor looked at the daypack. The charger box was inside. The methamphetamine was inside the charger box. The torn cellophane was a flaw in the disguise, a visible defect, and if anyone looked -- if Hafiz looked, if a police officer looked, if anyone at all looked at the box and noticed the tear and noticed the resealed flap and opened it and saw the vacuum-sealed bag and the white crystals -- it was over. Not metaphorically over. Literally over. Life over. The threshold was fifty grams and the box contained seventy and the margin between what he carried and what would kill him was twenty grams, the weight of four teaspoons, the weight of a letter, the weight of nothing, the weight of everything.

The panic reached its peak. The peak was a place where time stopped and the body's systems ran simultaneously -- the cardiovascular system hammering, the respiratory system gasping, the digestive system clenching, the endocrine system flooding, the nervous system firing on every channel -- and the convergence produced a moment of absolute, blinding clarity in which Connor Briggs saw himself as he was: a man in a car in a city in a country that would kill him, carrying a thing that would kill him, for a man who would kill him, because he had been too stupid and too proud and too lazy to learn the law of the place he had treated as a playground, and the playground had rules, and the rules had consequences, and the consequences were the only thing in the entire equation that did not care about his nationality, his passport, his parents, his Instagram, or his sincere belief that she'll be right.

She would not be right. She had never been right. *She'll be right* was the epitaph of a man who died of his own certainty.

The peak passed. Peaks always pass. The body cannot sustain maximum panic indefinitely -- the system regulates, the adrenaline metabolizes, the heart rate descends, not to normal but to a new baseline, a plateau of chronic fear that is livable in the way that chronic pain is livable, not comfortable but functional, the body adapting to a condition that the mind cannot resolve.

Connor sat in the Grab and breathed and the breathing slowed and the city continued and the car moved north toward Chow Kit and the daypack sat on his lap and the charger box was inside and the methamphetamine was inside the charger box and nothing had changed and everything had changed and the delivery was still happening because the delivery was always going to happen because Connor Briggs was not the kind of man who stopped.

He was the kind of man who continued.

---

Chow Kit was a different KL.

Not the heritage KL of Petaling Street, with its shophouses and temples and the warm nostalgia of Chinatown. Not the glossy KL of Bukit Bintang, with its malls and its neon and its aspirational consumerism. Chow Kit was the working KL, the underbelly KL, the KL that tourists were told to avoid after dark and that locals navigated with the casual wariness of people who knew their city's geography of risk.

The wet market was the centre of it. Hafiz dropped Connor at the edge -- the car couldn't penetrate the warren of stalls and narrow alleys that constituted the market's body, the organic sprawl of a commerce that had outgrown its boundaries and spilled into the streets, the pavements, the air.

"Here okay?" Hafiz said.

"Yeah. Cheers."

Connor got out. The daypack was on his back now. The charger box pressed against his spine through the bag's nylon, a pressure he had carried a hundred times before -- the pressure of a package, the weight of a delivery -- but the pressure was different now because the pressure had a name, and the name was methamphetamine, and the name changed the weight the way a diagnosis changes a symptom, not physically but ontologically, the thing becoming more real by being identified, the pain becoming sharper by being named.

The wet market hit him.

Sound first -- the roar of a hundred transactions happening simultaneously, vendors calling prices in Malay and Cantonese and Tamil, the thud of cleavers on wooden blocks, the splash of water from hoses washing the concrete floor, the hum of refrigeration units, the buzz of flies, the particular sonic density of a space where every surface is hard and every sound bounces.

Smell next -- and the smell was overwhelming. Fish, raw and absolute, the iodine-and-salt smell of marine life displayed on ice and wooden tables, their eyes milky, their gills still pink, their bodies glistening with the melt from the ice that was keeping them commercially viable. Prawns in plastic tubs, their antennae waving. Chickens hanging from hooks, plucked, pale, headless, their cavities dark. Offal in stainless steel trays -- liver, kidneys, tripe, heart -- the deep, iron smell of the internal, the biological reality that supermarkets conceal in plastic wrap and polystyrene.

And beneath the fish and the fowl and the offal, the other smell -- the floor, the water, the concrete saturated with decades of organic runoff, the archaeological strata of blood and scale and fat that no hose could fully remove, the smell of a place that processed life into death into food into waste, a place where the cycle was visible, unpackaged, honest.

Connor walked through it. He walked past a man cutting a whole tuna with a knife the length of his forearm, the blade moving through the flesh with the ease of practice, the pink meat separating cleanly, the blood thin and bright. He walked past a woman arranging limes in a pyramid, her hands quick and precise, the limes impossibly green against the grey concrete. He walked past a stall selling dried goods -- bags of dried shrimp, dried chillies, dried mushrooms, the concentrated essence of things, the water removed, the flavour concentrated, the shelf life extended into something approaching permanence.

The market was alive. The market was the most alive place in KL -- alive in the raw, biological, unsanitised sense, alive in the way that a body is alive when you cut it open and see the organs working, the blood moving, the system functioning in its fundamental, inelegant, magnificent way. The market was life without the filter. The market was the body of the city with its skin peeled back.

And Connor walked through it carrying methamphetamine.

The juxtaposition was the thing. The market sold food -- sustenance, nourishment, the raw materials of survival. The daypack carried poison -- crystalline, synthesised, the raw material of destruction. Both were products. Both had supply chains. Both had producers and distributors and consumers. Both were weighed on scales and priced by the gram. The symmetry was obscene and perfect, the dark comedy that the universe composed when it placed a drug mule in a food market, when it surrounded a man carrying death with the machinery of life.

He found the stall. Blue awning, behind the wet market, down an alley that smelled of drains and cooking oil. A man sat on a plastic stool beside a table stacked with boxes of dried goods. Uncle Lim. He was maybe sixty, thin, wearing a white singlet and cotton trousers and the expression of a man who had been sitting on that stool every morning for thirty years and would sit on it for thirty more, the expression of permanence, of rootedness, of a man whose place in the world was fixed while Connor's had been drifting since the day he left Melbourne.

Connor approached. The protocol was the same as always -- Felix's system, Felix's script, the lines that Connor delivered because the script required them.

"From Wei," Connor said.

Uncle Lim nodded. He extended a hand. Connor unzipped the daypack and removed the charger box. The torn cellophane. The resealed flap. The box that contained the charger housing that contained the vacuum-sealed bag that contained seventy grams of methamphetamine. He placed it in Uncle Lim's hand.

Uncle Lim looked at the box. He felt its weight. He turned it over once. Then he set it on the table, among the boxes of dried goods, where it was just another box, another product, another item in the inventory of a stall in a market in a city where commerce was so dense and so constant that a charger box on a table was invisible, camouflaged not by design but by context, the way a leaf is camouflaged on a forest floor.

The man reached into his pocket and produced a fold of ringgit. He counted. Connor counted with him, the ritual of payment, the exchange that made the transaction complete. Six hundred ringgit. Three hundred and twenty Malaysian dollars. Approximately one hundred and thirty US dollars. This was the price of carrying methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur -- one hundred and thirty dollars, the cost of three nights in a hostel, the cost of a nice dinner in Melbourne, the cost of the AirAsia ticket that had brought him here.

Connor took the money. Uncle Lim did not speak. Connor did not speak. The transaction was silent, as all of them were, the silence a protocol, an insulation, the absence of language as a defence against the language of the law, which would describe this transaction as *distribution* and *trafficking* and *capital offence*.

He walked back through the market. Past the fish and the chicken and the limes and the dried shrimp. Past the sound and the smell and the life. Back to the street. Back to the heat. Back to himself, though *himself* was a concept that had been so thoroughly hollowed out -- like the charger housing, emptied of its components, repurposed as a container for something it was never designed to hold -- that the concept no longer signified what it once had.

He stood on the pavement outside Chow Kit market. The morning sun was high now. The heat was absolute. His singlet was dark with sweat. His hands were empty -- the charger box was gone, the money was in his pocket, the daypack was light again, holding only his water bottle and his phone and the novel he would never read. His hands were empty and his hands were guilty and his hands had touched the torn cellophane and felt the edge of the vacuum-sealed bag and smelled the chemical sharpness of what was inside and the sensory evidence was in his skin now, in the oils of his fingertips, in the receptors of his nostrils, evidence that could not be deleted the way CCTV could not be deleted, evidence that was biological rather than digital, the body's own recording of what it had done.

---

He posted the photo at 11:47 AM.

He was sitting in the back of another Grab, heading south toward Petaling Street, the delivery complete, the money in his pocket, the panic metabolized into the low-grade nausea that was becoming his baseline. The Grab was stuck in traffic on Jalan Raja Laut. Through the window, the sky was doing something spectacular -- the pre-monsoon clouds building in the west, towering cumulus formations lit amber and gold by the sun, the kind of sky that social media was invented to capture, the kind of sky that made people stop and photograph and post and wait for the little hearts to accumulate.

Connor took the photo. The phone's camera captured the clouds, the buildings' silhouettes, the warm palette of a tropical sky doing what tropical skies do when the moisture content is high and the light is right. The photo was beautiful. The photo was the kind of photo that @ConnorGoesGlobal existed to produce -- evidence of a life lived in beautiful places, proof that leaving Melbourne had been the right choice, that the nomad path was the true path, that the 9-to-5 was a prison and the world was a gift.

He opened Instagram. He applied a filter -- the warm one, the one that added golden tones, the one that made everything look like a memory even as it was happening. He wrote a caption:

*Living my best life.*

Three words. Four syllables. Seven hashtags: #digitalnomad #kl #kualalumpur #sunset #livingmybestlife #travellife #noregrets.

He posted it. The photo went to his 4,200 followers -- the number he rounded up to "about five K" when people asked, the number that represented his audience, his community, his proof of relevance. The photo went to the grid, where it joined the other photos -- the hostel rooftop, the Petaling Street food, the Batu Caves selfie, the teh tarik latte art, the curated archive of a life that did not exist in the form the grid suggested.

The photo was a sunset. The reality was methamphetamine. The photo was *living my best life*. The reality was the charger box and the wet market and the panic attack in the back of a silver Myvi and the seventy grams and the fifty-gram threshold and the mandatory death penalty and the business card he still hadn't used and the burner phone he couldn't discard and the man on the rooftop who had told him the truth and the truth being worse than the lie because the lie had allowed him to function and the truth required him to choose and the choice he kept making was the wrong one.

*Living my best life.* Thirty-seven likes by the end of the hour. A comment from Jake: *Bro KL looks fire!* A comment from a stranger: *Goals.* A comment from his mother: *Beautiful sky sweetheart. Call me when you can xx.*

Connor stared at his mother's comment. The double x. The kisses. The shorthand of maternal love, compressed into two characters, posted under a photo taken by a man who had, forty-five minutes earlier, handed seventy grams of crystal methamphetamine to a man behind a wet market in exchange for six hundred ringgit.

He closed Instagram. He put the phone in his pocket. He looked out the window at the city that was beautiful and indifferent and would be here long after he was gone.

---

The Lantern Hostel was quiet when he returned.

The common room was empty. The TV was off. The ceiling fans turned in the amber light of the red lanterns. Mama Siti's kitchen was clean -- she had finished the morning service, the wok was hanging on its hook, the banana leaves were stacked, the sambal was covered in cling film. The air well admitted a column of white light that fell on the mosaic bench and lit the dust motes in the air, the microscopic debris of a building that was always, always shedding.

Connor climbed the stairs. First floor to second. The third step squeaked. The staircase walls were covered in stickers from travellers past -- BALI, CHIANG MAI, HANOI, SIEM REAP, the destinations of the circuit, the stamps of a community that moved through the world and left its mark in adhesive, in ink, in stories told on rooftops and in common rooms and in bunk beds at midnight.

He stopped at the second-floor landing. The bathroom door was ajar. He pushed it open.

The bathroom was small, tiled in white, the tiles cracked in places, the grout grey with tropical mould. A single shower stall with a curtain that didn't fully close. A sink with a mirror that was spotted with age. A squat toilet in the corner that no Western backpacker used voluntarily. The room smelled of damp and disinfectant and the faintly sweet rot of pipes in the tropics.

Connor stepped inside. He closed the door. He locked it -- the lock was a sliding bolt, brass, tarnished, the bolt fitting into a strike plate that was loose in its screws, the lock more psychological than physical, the privacy it provided more symbolic than structural.

He sat on the tile floor. The tiles were cool against his legs. The coolness was a relief -- the only physical relief available, the only sensation that was not contaminated by the morning's events.

He looked at his hands.

They were the same hands. The same size, the same shape, the same sun-bronzed colour, the same faded compass tattoo on the inner forearm -- the compass he'd gotten in Bali because he'd thought it meant something, thought it symbolised his commitment to wandering, to following no map, to letting the world guide him. The compass pointed in all four directions. The compass pointed nowhere. The compass was as lost as the man who wore it.

His hands. His fingertips. The whorls and ridges of his prints -- the same prints that were on CCTV at Wei's shop, on the charger box, on fourteen packages over five weeks, on the evidence that Felix had catalogued and stored and threatened to release. His fingerprints were the signatures he'd left on his own death warrant, signed and dated and filed, the bureaucracy of self-destruction, the paperwork of a man who had walked into a system that recorded everything and forgotten that the recordings existed.

His hands had touched the plastic. Through the torn cellophane, through the resealed flap, his fingertips had been centimetres from the vacuum-sealed bag, from the crystals inside, from the substance that was worth RM600 in his pocket and a death sentence on his record. He hadn't touched the crystals themselves -- the vacuum seal was intact, the barrier was there -- but the proximity was enough. The proximity was the truth made tactile, the truth made physical, the truth that had been abstract on the rooftop and was now in his hands, in the oils of his skin, in the chemical smell that he could still detect if he brought his fingers to his nose.

He did not bring his fingers to his nose.

He sat on the tile floor of the second-floor bathroom of The Lantern Hostel and looked at his hands and the hands looked back and the hands were the hands of a drug mule, the hands of a man who carried methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur, and the man who owned the hands was twenty-seven years old and from Melbourne and had a compass tattoo and a mother who posted kisses under his sunset photos and a father who was a property developer and a sister who resented him and 4,200 Instagram followers and a bed in Dorm 3 and a blue towel under his pillow and a name scratched into his bed frame that he'd never read and a business card in his wallet he'd never used and a burner phone in his pocket he couldn't destroy and a life that was measured not in years remaining but in deliveries remaining, and the deliveries were counting down, and the countdown was approaching a number, and the number was one, and the one was a suitcase to Penang by bus, and the bus would pass through checkpoints, and the checkpoints had dogs, and the dogs could smell what he had carried, what he was carrying, what he would carry.

He sat. The bathroom was quiet. The pipes hummed. The water in the toilet moved slightly, the small, mysterious oscillation of still water in old plumbing, the building's circulatory system maintaining its own rhythm independent of the humans it housed.

On the wall of the shower stall, written in black marker, the handwriting angular and deliberate:

*@HostelReaper was here. Check-out is mandatory.*

Connor had seen it before. He'd photographed it once, early in his stay, thinking it was street art, thinking it was content, thinking it was the kind of edgy, mysterious thing that would perform well on Instagram. He hadn't posted it. He'd forgotten about it. Now he read it again and the words were different -- not different in their letters but different in their meaning, the way a sign that says DANGER is different when you're standing in the danger, the way a warning is different when the thing it warns about is happening.

*Check-out is mandatory.*

He stared at his hands. The hands that had touched the box. The hands that had handed it to Uncle Lim. The hands that had taken the money. The hands that would, in a few days, lift a suitcase full of methamphetamine onto a bus and carry it to Penang through a country that would kill him for carrying it.

He washed them. He turned on the tap and the water came, lukewarm as always -- the hostel's plumbing unable to produce anything fully hot or fully cold, the temperature a permanent compromise, the water of a building that had been built for commerce and requisitioned for war and abandoned and revived and was now housing the man it would lose. He washed his hands with the bar of soap that sat in the dish beside the sink, the soap that was communal, touched by every guest, diminishing with each use, the soap that was a record of every hand that had washed in this bathroom.

He washed and the water ran and the soap lathered and the lather was white and the white reminded him of the crystals and the crystals reminded him of the box and the box reminded him of Wei and Wei reminded him of Felix and Felix reminded him of the rooftop and the rooftop reminded him of the truth and the truth was that washing would not help, that the stain was not on his hands but in his history, that the evidence was not biological but digital, that the CCTV footage and the phone records and the bank transfers existed in servers and databases and systems that soap could not reach, that water could not dissolve, that his hands -- however many times he washed them -- could not undo.

He turned off the tap. He dried his hands on his shorts. He looked at his face in the mirror. The face was his -- the squint, the stubble, the sun-bleach, the face of @ConnorGoesGlobal, the face of a man living his best life. The face was the same face that was on the CCTV at Wei's shop. The face was the same face that Sergeant Ahmad had looked at during the checkpoint. The face was the same face that his mother had kissed goodbye at Tullamarine Airport four years ago, the face she saw on FaceTime every third Sunday, the face she would see on the news if this ended the way the numbers said it would end.

*Living my best life.*

He unlocked the bathroom door. He walked to Dorm 3. He lay on Bed 7. The ceiling fan turned above him. The blue towel was under his pillow. His hand, without thought, slid beneath the pillow and found the towel's familiar fabric -- soft, thin, microfiber, the texture of twelve countries and four years and a life that had been, until five weeks ago, merely aimless rather than fatal.

He held the towel. The towel held nothing. The ceiling fan turned. The red lanterns glowed. And Connor Briggs lay in his bed in the city that would kill him and waited for the next instruction, the next message, the next number on the burner phone, the next step in a sequence that was moving toward an ending he could see with the terrible clarity of a man who has been told the truth and found that the truth, unlike the lie, offered no comfort, no protection, no distance.

The lie had been a room with walls. The truth was a room without them. The truth was the open air, the full view, the panoramic vista of a life collapsing in real time, visible from every angle, unobstructed by the architecture of denial.

And the view, from here, was nothing but sky, and the sky was beautiful, and the sky did not care.
# Chapter 24: The System

The message came at 11:47 PM.

Connor was lying in Bed 7, not sleeping, not awake, suspended in the intermediate state that had replaced sleep since the rooftop -- a shallow, buzzing limbo where his body lay horizontal and his mind ran vertical, climbing the same walls, finding the same ceiling, dropping back to the same floor. The dorm was dark. Three of the eight beds were occupied -- a Dutch couple who left early and returned late and communicated in whispers so soft they might have been breathing, and a solo Korean traveler whose name Connor had never learned because learning names required energy and energy was now a finite resource allocated entirely to the project of not thinking about the suitcase.

The burner phone vibrated against his thigh. He kept it in his pocket now, even in bed, even in the dark, the way a soldier sleeps with his weapon -- not because he wanted to but because the alternative was worse, the alternative being to leave it in the locker where it might buzz unheard and Felix might interpret the silence as resistance and resistance might accelerate the timeline that Connor was trying, desperately, to delay.

*Wei's shop. 15 minutes. Back entrance. Come alone.*

Connor read the message in the phone's blue glow, the screen held close to his face, the light casting his features in the color of something drowned. The back entrance. He'd used the front entrance on Day 39, the bell ringing, the Nokia 3310 in the window. The back entrance was different. The back entrance was the alley behind Petaling Street, the narrow corridor between shophouses where the bins lived and the rats lived and the things that happened at midnight lived, the entrance that existed for the purposes that didn't come through the front door.

He sat up. The bunk creaked. The Dutch woman in Bed 4 shifted but didn't wake. The ceiling fan turned overhead, its rhythm unchanged since his first night in this room -- *tick, tick, tick* -- the metronome of a countdown he hadn't known was counting.

He dressed in the dark. Board shorts, singlet, flip-flops. The uniform of a man who had been wearing the same three outfits in rotation for six weeks because laundry required the laundromat two blocks away and the laundromat required coins and the coins required going outside during daylight hours and daylight hours were now hostile, exposed, the hours when police moved and checkpoints operated and a man with methamphetamine residue on his fingerprints might encounter a dog or a question he couldn't answer.

The staircase was dark. The red lanterns on the ground floor were off -- Mei Ling switched them off at midnight, one of the hostel's few enforced routines, the lanterns dying like embers in sequence, the last glow fading from the air well at 12:05. Without the lanterns, the hostel was a different building. Older. The plasterwork on the walls visible in its decay, the cracks and stains and water damage that the warm light concealed but the dark revealed, the building's true face emerging after hours like a second identity that the daylight persona kept hidden.

Connor descended. The third step squeaked. It always squeaked. It had squeaked for Lena too, though he didn't know that yet.

He crossed the ground floor by memory -- the reception desk on his left, the common room on his right, the kitchen ahead, the courtyard beyond. Mama Siti's station was clean, the stove cold, the banana leaves folded for tomorrow's nasi lemak. The kitchen smelled of turmeric and coconut and the sweet, faintly rotten undertone of a tropical building at night, when the heat released the day's accumulated organic chemistry -- spilled milk, rice water, the sweat of forty-two travelers absorbed into wood and plaster and tile.

The back door was past the kitchen, past the courtyard, through a narrow passage that led to the alley. The door was old -- solid timber, a deadbolt that required a key Connor didn't have but that someone had left unlocked, which was either negligence or invitation, and Connor didn't ask which because asking required acknowledging that someone had prepared the route and the preparation implied premeditation and premeditation implied a plan and the plan was not his.

The alley was dark. Not entirely -- a security light on the building opposite cast a cone of orange that reached halfway across the width, enough to see the bins, the drainage grate, the monsoon drain running along the building's foundation, the shapes of things that were refuse and the shapes of things that might not be. The air was thick. KL at midnight was hotter than KL at noon in a way that defied meteorology -- the concrete and zinc and asphalt releasing the stored heat of the day in a slow exhalation that made the air feel used, secondhand, breathed by the city and returned. The smell was the alley's signature: rotting fruit from the market stalls, diesel from a generator somewhere, the acrid chemical sweetness of rat poison, and under everything, the sewage-and-rain-water perfume of the monsoon drain.

Felix was leaning against the wall beside Wei's back door, smoking. The cigarette's tip was a small orange star in the dark, the only point of color in the alley's monochrome. He wore the linen shirt. He always wore the linen shirt at night, the shirt that made him look like a man on holiday rather than a man at work, the costume of leisure that was also the uniform of professional distance -- you don't get your good shirt dirty, you don't get your fingerprints on things, you maintain the separation between the person and the function.

"You came quickly," Felix said. Not a compliment. An observation. The observation of a man cataloguing response times, measuring compliance, noting that the interval between summons and arrival was shrinking as the leverage increased.

"You said fifteen minutes."

"I did." Felix dropped the cigarette and ground it under his sandal. Leather sandals, even in the alley, even at midnight. The man wore leather sandals to a drug logistics briefing in a rat-infested alley at midnight, and the sandals were the sanest thing about the scene. "Come inside."

He opened the back door. No key -- the door was already unlocked, had been unlocked for this purpose, the locks and unlocks of Wei's shop calibrated to a schedule that had nothing to do with business hours and everything to do with the other business, the one that operated in the spaces between clocks.

The corridor was the same two meters of darkness Connor remembered from Day 39. The same concrete floor. The same hidden door. But this time, when they emerged into the back room, the room was different.

The packaging table was clear. The vacuum sealer, the cling film, the rolls of black plastic -- all gone, stored or moved or vanished into the supply chain's digestive system. In their place: a laptop, open, its screen the brightest object in the room, casting blue-white light on the metal surface like a surgical lamp on an operating table.

Wei was there. Standing behind the laptop, his posture unchanged from Day 39 -- the hunch, the glasses, the expression that was not an expression but an absence of expression, the functional blankness of a man who had optimized his face for invisibility. He wore the same grey polo shirt. He might have worn it every day since the day he was born.

And beside the laptop, mounted on a small tripod, angled toward the screen: a second monitor, this one showing a grid of images -- black and white, slightly grainy, the resolution of cheap security cameras, the images arranged in a four-by-four matrix that Connor's eyes took a moment to resolve into what they were.

CCTV footage. Sixteen camera feeds, live, the timestamps running in the bottom-right corner of each frame, the time reading 00:03:17 and counting. Sixteen views of sixteen locations, and each location was somewhere Connor had been.

"Sit down," Felix said.

There was a chair. A single metal folding chair, positioned in front of the laptop and the monitor, the chair placed with the deliberate precision of a seat in a theater -- not for comfort but for viewing, for the consumption of a performance that had been prepared in advance. Connor sat. The chair was cold. The metal was the temperature of the room, which was the temperature of concrete at night, which was cooler than the outside air but not cool enough to be called cold -- a tepid, neutral temperature that matched nothing and comforted nothing.

Felix stood to his right. Wei stood to his left. The arrangement was not accidental. It was the formation of a presentation -- the presenter and the technical support, the speaker and the projectionist, the man who would explain and the man who would display.

"What you're about to see," Felix said, "is why you're going to do the Penang job. Not because I'm threatening you. Not because I'm persuading you. Because you're going to understand, in specific and undeniable terms, that there is no alternative."

He nodded at Wei. Wei touched the laptop's trackpad. The CCTV grid on the second monitor changed -- the sixteen live feeds replaced by a single image, enlarged, high-resolution despite the camera's limitations. A frozen frame.

Connor looked at the image and saw himself.

The image was from Day 6. The first delivery. The envelope. He recognized the location immediately -- the cafe in Bukit Bintang, the outdoor seating area, the tables and umbrellas arranged in the same configuration he'd walked through with Felix's envelope in his back pocket. The camera was mounted high, probably above the entrance, angled down. The resolution was sufficient to show Connor's face, his clothes (the board shorts, the singlet with the ironic slogan), the envelope in his right hand as he held it out to the man at the table.

The image was clear. The image was damning. The image was Connor Briggs, identifiable, undeniable, delivering an envelope full of drug money to a man at a cafe while the timestamp recorded the date and time with the indifferent precision of a machine that did not know or care what it was witnessing.

"Day six," Felix said. "The envelope. Two thousand ringgit in cash. Payment for a previous shipment. The man you delivered to is known to the narcotics unit. His name is on a watchlist. If they obtain this footage, the inference is clear: you delivered payment for drugs."

Wei clicked. The image changed. Another frozen frame. Another location. Another day.

"Day nine. The first package. Brickfields. Sixty grams of methamphetamine in a brown paper parcel. You're on camera at Mr. Tan's electronics wholesale, entering through the back. The camera caught your face, your daypack, the parcel in your hand."

Click. New image. Connor at the entrance to the Sentul warehouse, the red backpack visible on his shoulder, his face turned toward the camera in a three-quarter profile that showed the compass tattoo on his forearm, the stubble, the squint.

"Day thirty-seven. The backpack. Six hundred grams. You carried it on the LRT and then walked to the warehouse. There are cameras on the train, cameras at the station, cameras at the warehouse gate. Your entire route is documented."

Click. Click. Click. The images cycled -- a slideshow, a gallery, a curated exhibition of Connor's complicity displayed in the flat light of security cameras across Kuala Lumpur. Each image showed him. Each image showed a delivery. Each image was timestamped, located, specific. His face, his clothes, his hands holding or carrying or transferring objects that were, in each case, drugs or drug money, objects that the camera recorded with the same neutral fidelity it applied to everything else in its field of view -- the weather, the pedestrians, the motorcycles, the slow passage of ordinary life alongside the extraordinary fact of a man committing capital crimes in plain sight.

Fourteen deliveries. Fourteen camera feeds. Fourteen images of Connor Briggs doing the thing that, under Malaysian law, would end his life.

"That's your visual record," Felix said. His voice hadn't changed. It maintained the same register it had maintained since the rooftop -- calm, explanatory, the voice of a man giving a quarterly business review rather than demonstrating to another man that his life was over. "But CCTV is only one data point. Wei?"

Wei touched the trackpad again. The monitor cleared. A new screen appeared -- a spreadsheet, or something that functioned like a spreadsheet, rows and columns of data arranged with the clean geometry of a system designed for tracking.

"Your phone records," Felix said. "The burner phone I gave you. Every text message sent and received. Every address. Every instruction. Every confirmation. Every 'done' and 'on my way' and 'package delivered.'"

Connor looked at the screen. The data was arranged chronologically. Each row was a message. The columns showed date, time, content, and -- this was the detail that made his stomach contract -- GPS coordinates. The burner phone had been tracking his location. Every delivery, every pickup, every route -- the phone had recorded it, silently, invisibly, the GPS chip performing its function with the same indifference as the CCTV cameras, the same mechanical honesty, the same inability to distinguish between the mundane and the catastrophic.

"I didn't know the phone tracked--"

"Of course you didn't." Felix's interruption was gentle, almost sympathetic. "That's the point. The phone tracked you because the phone was designed to track you. The same way the cameras were positioned to film you. The same way the accounts were structured to trace you. Every element of this system was designed to create a complete evidentiary record of your activities. Not because I wanted to trap you -- because the system requires it."

He paused. He paced -- two steps left, two steps right, the same compact movement from the rooftop, the thinking man's walk, the walk of a man whose thoughts were already complete and whose pacing was for his audience's benefit, a visual aid to emphasize that what he was about to say was considered, structured, important.

"Let me explain how this works," Felix said. "Not my operation. The network. The larger system."

He spoke the way a consultant speaks -- clearly, without jargon, with the organized precision of someone who has given this presentation before and has refined it through iteration. Connor sat in the metal chair and listened and the listening was a form of paralysis, the paralysis of a man watching his own autopsy.

"The network operates across six countries. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Hong Kong. It moves product -- methamphetamine, primarily, some heroin, some ketamine -- through a system of couriers, intermediaries, and local contacts. The couriers are, almost always, travelers. Backpackers. People like you."

He let the phrase *people like you* settle. It settled the way all of Felix's phrases settled -- precisely, in the exact location he intended, with the exact weight he intended.

"The system has a protocol for every contingency. If product is lost, it's replaced. If a contact is compromised, they're rotated. If a courier is arrested--"

He stopped. The stop was theatrical -- the pause before the important slide, the moment of silence before the data point that changes the trajectory of the presentation.

"If a courier is arrested," Felix said, "the courier must be silenced. Before trial. Before testimony. Before any names can be spoken in a courtroom or a police interrogation room."

The room was silent. The fluorescent light buzzed. Wei stood motionless behind the laptop, his hands at his sides, his expression unchanged, a man standing in the presence of a statement about murder the way another man might stand in the presence of a weather forecast.

"Silenced," Connor repeated. The word was flat in his mouth. Flat and heavy, like a coin placed on a dead man's tongue.

"The system protects itself," Felix said. "That's not a threat. It's an engineering principle. Any component that threatens the system's integrity is neutralized. The system doesn't make exceptions. It can't afford to. It operates in countries with death penalties, life sentences, extradition treaties. A single name spoken to the wrong person can collapse the network. So the network ensures that names are never spoken."

"What does that mean? Practically. What does *silenced* mean?"

Felix looked at him. The look was steady, unblinking, the look of a man who was deciding how much truth to dispense and had decided on all of it.

"It means what you think it means."

"They kill them."

"The system removes the risk. The method varies. The result doesn't."

Connor's hands were on his thighs. His fingers were digging into the fabric of his board shorts, the pressure a counterpoint to the pressure in his chest, the physical acting as a valve for the psychological. His heart was doing something it had never done before -- not racing, not pounding, but tightening, contracting, the muscle working harder to push blood through arteries that had narrowed with adrenaline, the body's ancient response to the proximity of death, even when the death was described rather than present.

"Has it happened before?" Connor asked. "Here. In KL. Has someone--"

"Yes."

The word was a door opening onto a room Connor didn't want to enter. But the door was open and the light was on and Felix was standing beside it, gesturing him through.

"Her name was Lena."

The name landed in the room like something dropped from a height. Not because Connor recognized it -- he didn't, not consciously, not yet. But the name had a weight that the room absorbed, a frequency that the fluorescent light seemed to modulate, a presence that changed the temperature of the air or seemed to, the way certain words in certain contexts create physical sensations that have no physical cause.

"Lena Ekström. Swedish. Twenty-two. She stayed at the Lantern Hostel for four weeks, about a year ago. Dorm 3. She slept in Bed 7."

Connor's fingers stopped moving. His hands went still on his thighs. The stillness was not calm. The stillness was the body's override -- the moment when the incoming data is too significant for the usual processing and the system pauses, suspends all non-essential functions, directs all resources to the single task of comprehension.

*Bed 7.*

His bed. She had slept in his bed.

"I recruited her the same way I recruited you," Felix said. "She was traveling solo. She was running low on money. She was -- and this is the common factor, Connor, this is what I look for -- she was someone who had built her entire identity around being somewhere else, and the thought of going home was more frightening than anything she might encounter abroad. She was you. Different country, different language, different face, same architecture."

He said *same architecture* the way an engineer says it -- admiring the design, the structural similarity between two buildings that look different but share the same load-bearing principles.

"She carried packages for seven weeks. Envelopes, parcels, backpacks. The same escalation. She was good -- reliable, quiet, didn't ask questions. Better than you, actually. She never questioned anything until the end."

"What happened?"

"The final job. Same as yours -- a suitcase, KL to a border crossing. But hers was the Thai border. Bukit Kayu Hitam checkpoint. The suitcase contained two hundred grams of methamphetamine sewn into the lining. She was arrested at the checkpoint. A dog alerted on the suitcase. She was detained."

Felix delivered this the way he delivered everything -- as data, as sequence, as the orderly progression of events that followed from causes and led to effects, the narrative stripped of emotion and presented as mechanism. But beneath the delivery, beneath the consultant's cadence and the engineer's precision, there was something else -- not remorse, not guilt, but a form of professional acknowledgment, the way a surgeon might describe a procedure that resulted in the patient's death: factual, technical, with the faintest undertone of something that was not quite regret but occupied the same neighborhood.

"She's in Kajang Prison," Felix said. "Awaiting trial. She's been there for eleven months. Her trial hasn't been scheduled yet. Under Malaysian law, she's charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act. Mandatory death penalty. Her parents fly from Stockholm every three months to visit. They sit in a waiting room for four hours to see her for thirty minutes through a glass partition. She's twenty-three now. She may never be twenty-four."

The room was silent. The fluorescent tube buzzed. Wei stood like a post. And Connor sat in the metal chair and felt the name *Lena* move through him the way a wave moves through water -- not displacing the water but changing its shape, temporarily, permanently, the water never quite returning to the configuration it held before the wave passed through.

*Lena. Bed 7. Dorm 3.*

The bed he slept in every night. The mattress he turned on, the frame his hand rested against, the wood his fingers had brushed in the dark on the first night when he'd felt something scratched into the surface and hadn't looked.

"There's a name," Connor said. His voice was barely there -- a whisper, a breath shaped like words. "Scratched into the bed frame. On Bed 7. I felt it. The first night. I never--"

"Looked at it," Felix finished. "No. You wouldn't have. It's not the kind of thing you look at. It's the kind of thing you feel and forget, the way you feel a draught and forget it, the way you feel a warning and forget it. Lena scratched her name into that bed frame during her last week at the hostel. She knew, by then, what she was involved in. She knew she couldn't stop. And she left her name in the wood the way people leave messages in bottles -- not because they expect to be found but because the act of writing is a form of existence, a way of saying *I was here* to a future that might not include them."

The poetry of it was deliberate. Felix was a man who understood the value of narrative, who knew that the right story at the right moment was more powerful than any threat, more compelling than any evidence. He had shown Connor the CCTV footage and the phone records and the spreadsheet of GPS coordinates, and those were data. Now he was showing Connor the human cost, and the human cost was a name scratched into wood by a twenty-two-year-old Swedish girl who was now rotting in a Malaysian prison while her parents flew twelve thousand kilometers to see her through glass.

The data was frightening. The story was devastating.

"You didn't help her," Connor said.

"I couldn't help her. The system doesn't allow it. Once a courier is arrested, the courier is a liability. The system's response to a liability is containment. Lena was contained by the legal system before the network's protocol could... take effect. The police held her. The prison holds her now. She's contained."

"You mean they would have killed her."

"I mean the system would have neutralized the risk. Lena is alive because the police were efficient. Because the arrest was public. Because the Swedish embassy was notified within hours. The system doesn't operate where there's visibility. It operates in the gaps -- the holding cells, the transfer vans, the moments between arrest and processing when a person is in custody but not yet in the system. Those are the moments when the protocol executes."

Connor heard the word *executes* and the word split in his mind like a cell dividing -- *executes* meaning carries out, performs, implements, and *executes* meaning kills, ends, terminates. Both meanings were accurate. Both meanings were intended. Felix was a man who chose his words the way he chose his couriers -- carefully, for maximum utility, with full awareness of what they carried.

"So if I get caught," Connor said, "and I'm in a holding cell. And no one knows I'm there. The system--"

"Protects itself."

The sentence was a period. The sentence was a door closing. The sentence was the sound of a lock engaging in a mechanism designed to keep things in rather than out.

Connor looked at the laptop screen. The phone records glowed in their columns -- date, time, message, GPS. Each row was a delivery. Each delivery was a crime. Each crime was a thread in a net that was now so dense, so comprehensive, so meticulously documented that the net was indistinguishable from the thing it contained. Connor was inside the net. The net was the evidence. And the evidence was, as Felix had explained on the rooftop, not evidence against Felix. It was evidence against Connor.

"Show him the rest," Felix said to Wei.

Wei's hands moved on the trackpad. The phone records disappeared. A new screen appeared -- a file directory, folders arranged by name. Connor's name was one. BRIGGS, C. was the folder label. Wei opened it. Inside: subfolders. CCTV. PHONE. FINANCIAL. DELIVERIES. CONTACTS.

The organization was professional. The organization was corporate. The organization was the filing system of a business that tracked its assets the way any business tracked its assets -- with categories and subcategories and timestamps and cross-references and the particular neurotic thoroughness of an enterprise that understood the value of documentation.

Wei opened FINANCIAL. A bank statement appeared -- Connor's bank statement, the real one, the one from his Australian account. The deposits were highlighted in yellow: RM500 here, RM1,000 there, RM2,000, RM2,000, RM2,000 -- the weekly payments from Felix, converted and deposited, each one a data point in a pattern that any forensic accountant could read as easily as a children's book. Unexplained income. Irregular deposits. Amounts consistent with courier fees. The financial signature of a drug mule, as clear and readable as a barcode.

"How did you get my bank statement?" Connor's voice cracked on the word *bank*. The crack was the sound of something giving way -- not the wall, the wall had collapsed on the rooftop, but a smaller structure, a secondary fortification, the inner keep of a castle whose outer walls were already rubble.

"You logged into your banking app on the hostel wifi," Felix said. "The hostel wifi routes through a server that logs all traffic. Wei administers the server."

Of course. Of course the wifi. Of course the server. Of course the man who repaired phones also administered the digital infrastructure that captured every login, every password, every bank balance and email and search query of every traveler who connected to the Lantern Hostel's wifi and typed the password from the whiteboard behind reception and never, not once, considered that free wifi in a building owned by strangers in a foreign country might not be free.

"You have everything," Connor said.

"The system has everything. I am a component of the system. Wei is a component. You are a component. The difference is that Wei and I are functional components, and you are--" He paused, selecting the word. "A consumable."

The word *consumable* was the worst word Felix had ever spoken. Worse than *methamphetamine*, worse than *silenced*, worse than *death penalty*. Because *consumable* was the word that told Connor exactly what he was -- not a person, not a partner, not even a victim, but a resource, a material, a thing that was used and used up and replaced. A consumable. Like printer ink. Like coffee pods. Like the vacuum bags on Wei's table that held the drugs and were thrown away when the drugs were delivered.

"The Penang job," Felix said. "It's scheduled for four days from now. You'll take a bus from TBS -- Terminal Bersepadu Selatan -- to Butterworth. The suitcase will be packed by Wei. You'll check into a guesthouse in Georgetown, meet a contact, hand over the suitcase, and take the bus back. Round trip: two days. Payment: RM10,000. After that, your file" -- he gestured at the laptop, at the folder marked BRIGGS, C. -- "is archived. Not deleted. Archived. It stays in the system as insurance. But the active phase of your involvement ends. You're free to leave Malaysia. I'd recommend you do."

"And if I'm caught?"

"Don't get caught."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer the system provides. Don't get caught. The alternative to not getting caught is getting caught, and the alternative to getting caught is what I've just described. The protocol. The holding cell. The gap between arrest and processing." He paused. "The system."

Connor looked at Wei. Wei looked at nothing. Wei was the blankest person Connor had ever encountered -- a man who had refined his humanity to a point so fine it was invisible, a man who existed in the gaps between expressions the way the system operated in the gaps between institutions. Wei was the system's face, or more accurately, the system's absence of face. The system did not need a face. The system needed a server and a laptop and a filing system and a network of cameras and a protocol for silencing liabilities and Wei provided all of these things with the same flat efficiency he applied to replacing cracked phone screens.

"I'd like to leave now," Connor said.

"Of course." Felix stepped aside. The gesture was courteous, almost deferential, the gesture of a host concluding a meeting, showing his guest to the door. The civility was obscene.

Connor stood. The metal chair scraped on the concrete floor. The sound was sharp in the quiet room, a brief violence of metal on mineral that the fluorescent light seemed to amplify.

"Connor." Felix's voice stopped him at the corridor entrance. "One more thing. Priya."

The name was a different kind of bomb. Not the slow-detonation data bomb of the CCTV footage or the precision strike of Lena's story, but something warmer, sharper, a blade rather than a blast.

"She came to see me two days ago. In my room. She told me she knew what I was doing and that she was going to tell the police."

Connor's body went rigid. The rigidity was involuntary -- the body's response to the mention of a loved one in a dangerous context, the primate brain's alarm at the proximity of threat and bond, predator and mate, in the same sentence.

"I explained to her," Felix continued, "that if she went to the police, the first person they'd investigate would be you. Not me. You. The man whose face is on every camera, whose fingerprints are on every package, whose phone records document every delivery. I explained that her going to the police would not save you. It would accelerate your prosecution."

"What did she say?"

"She cried. Then she left. She hasn't spoken to me since. I don't expect she will." He paused. "She loves you, Connor. That's inconvenient for both of you. Love is not a variable the system accounts for. But it's not a variable the system fears, either. Love doesn't overwrite evidence. Love doesn't erase CCTV footage. Love doesn't change the Dangerous Drugs Act."

Connor walked through the corridor. Through the shop. Past the Nokia 3310, the coiled cables, the cracked screens, the archaeology of obsolete technology that lined the walls of a shop that was also a data center, a surveillance hub, a filing cabinet for the documented destruction of human lives. The bell above the door didn't ring -- he went out the back way, through the alley, into the midnight air.

The alley was the same as when he'd entered -- the bins, the rats, the monsoon drain, the orange security light casting its partial cone. But Connor was not the same. Connor had entered the alley as a man who knew he was trapped. He exited the alley as a man who understood the trap -- its dimensions, its mechanisms, its precedents, its implications. The difference between knowing and understanding was the difference between feeling a cage and seeing its blueprint, and the blueprint was worse because the blueprint showed you that the cage had been designed, that the cage had been built to specification, that the cage had held someone before you and would hold someone after you and the cage was not personal, not malicious, not even particularly interested in your suffering. The cage was a system. The system was efficient. And efficiency, Connor was learning, was the most terrifying quality a thing could possess.

He walked back through the hostel's rear door. Through the kitchen. Past Mama Siti's station. Through the ground floor, dark, the air well above letting in a column of night sky that was not black but the bruised purple of KL's light pollution, the city's glow reflected back by clouds that were always there, always holding rain, always threatening to release it.

The staircase. The third step. The second floor. The corridor. The door to Dorm 3.

He entered quietly. The Dutch couple slept. The Korean traveler slept. The other beds were empty -- their occupants out on Changkat, drinking, dancing, living the hostel life that Connor had lived a month ago, a year ago, a lifetime ago, the life of a backpacker whose biggest problem was a dead phone and a low bank balance and a hangover that wouldn't quit.

Bed 7 was as he'd left it. The thin mattress, the vinyl cover, the sheet that never stayed tucked, the pillow with the case that smelled of detergent and sweat and the faintest trace of sunscreen. His blue travel towel was under the pillow -- the Sea to Summit, the companion of twelve countries, the microfiber rectangle that was his most constant possession, more constant than any friendship, more reliable than any plan.

He climbed into bed. He lay on his back. The ceiling fan turned.

And then he did something he had never done in six weeks of sleeping in this bed.

He reached down. His right hand moved along the wooden frame -- the frame that was old, that was original to the hostel's conversion, that was made of a dark tropical hardwood that had absorbed decades of humidity and human contact -- salt-sweat, sunscreen, the oils of a thousand hands -- and had become, through this absorption, something more than wood -- a record, a medium, a surface that held the impressions of everyone who had passed through.

His fingers found it. The roughness in the grain. The deliberate marks, the scratches that were too regular to be damage, too purposeful to be accident. Letters. Carved with something sharp -- a knife, a key, a nail -- pressed into the wood with the slow patience of someone who had time and darkness and the need to leave a mark.

He pulled out the burner phone. Held the screen's light to the frame.

LENA

Five letters. Capitals. Carved shallow but clear, the wood lighter where the surface had been broken, the letters the color of the wood's interior, the color beneath the stain, the raw material under the finish. Each letter was about two centimeters tall, carved with varying pressure -- the L deep, the E shallower, the N deeper again, the A trailing off, as if the hand that carved it had been steadying itself, had been fighting the tremor that came from carving your name into the bed where you slept in the hostel where you'd been recruited as a drug mule in a country that would kill you for it.

LENA.

The girl who slept here before him. The girl who carried packages before him. The girl who was recruited by Felix before him, the same way, the same architecture, the same escalation from envelope to package to backpack to suitcase. The girl who carved her name into the wood the way shipwreck survivors carve messages into driftwood -- not because anyone will read it but because the act of writing is the last assertion of existence available to someone who is about to be erased.

LENA was in Kajang Prison. LENA had been there for eleven months. LENA's parents flew from Stockholm every three months to see her through glass. LENA was twenty-three and might never be twenty-four.

LENA had slept in this bed. LENA had lain where Connor lay. LENA had stared at this ceiling fan, these walls, this column of polluted sky through the air well. LENA had felt the same fear Connor felt, had run the same calculations, had arrived at the same conclusion: there was no way out that didn't lead through the system, and the system was designed to ensure that no one who entered it emerged intact.

Connor pressed his thumb against the letters. The wood was smooth where it hadn't been carved and rough where it had, the contrast tactile, undeniable, the kind of evidence that didn't require a camera or a phone record or a spreadsheet -- the evidence of a human hand acting on a physical surface, leaving a permanent mark in a temporary world.

He traced the L. The E. The N. The A.

Each letter was a question. Each letter was an answer. Each letter was a warning that he had received on his first night in this bed and had ignored, the way he had ignored every warning -- the signs, the proverbs, the printed law, the business card, the photographs, the documentary on TV, the name carved into wood by the girl who had his job before him and was now in prison awaiting a sentence that would either be life or death, and neither option was life, not really, not in any sense that the word *life* was meant to convey.

LENA.

He lay in the dark and held his thumb against the letters and the letters held him back. The ceiling fan turned. The call to prayer was five hours away. The suitcase was four days away. The system was everywhere, and the system was patient, and the system had done this before, and the system would do it again, and Connor was inside the system now, had been inside it since the first evening in the common room when a German man with a scar on his eyebrow had bought him a beer and said *I could use someone reliable*.

Somewhere on the third floor, in her dorm, Tomoko Sato was awake. She sat cross-legged on her bed with her new camera -- purchased that afternoon from a shop in Low Yat Plaza, RM1,200, a Fujifilm X-T5, a downgrade from the stolen Nikon but functional, capable, sufficient. She had reported the theft to the police. She had filed a report with Mei Ling. She had done everything a person does when their property is stolen, and she had done one thing more: she had opened her laptop and logged into her cloud backup and downloaded every photograph from the past three weeks, including the photographs of Felix making exchanges at midnight, the photographs of Wei's shop with the light on late, the photographs of Connor carrying packages through Petaling Street with the expression of a man who did not know he was being documented.

The camera had been stolen. The photographs had not.

Tomoko was composing an email. The email was addressed to a contact at The Star, the Malaysian newspaper, a journalist named Sarah Lim who covered crime and corruption in KL. The email contained six photographs, a narrative summary, and a request for a meeting. The email was not yet sent. Tomoko's finger hovered over the trackpad, the cursor over the Send button, her face illuminated by the laptop screen in the dark dorm.

She hesitated. Not because she was unsure of the content -- the photographs were clear, the narrative was factual, the evidence was solid. She hesitated because sending the email would activate a sequence of events that she could not control once initiated, a cascade that would involve police, journalists, embassies, and courts, and somewhere in that cascade, Connor Briggs would be caught in the machinery. She had warned him. He had dismissed her. She owed him nothing.

But she had seen his face, earlier that evening, when he'd returned from Wei's shop. She had been in the common room, reading, and he'd walked through without seeing her, and his face had been the face of a man who had been shown something terrible -- not afraid, not angry, but extinguished, the light behind the eyes dimmed to a frequency too low for warmth. She had seen that face before, in conflict zones, in refugee camps, in the places where her camera took her and her photographs told the stories that the faces contained. It was the face of someone who had realized, too late, that they were inside something they could not survive.

She closed the laptop. Not yet. Not tonight. Tomorrow she would decide. Tomorrow, when the decision could be made in daylight, when the consequences could be weighed against the morning and the morning would tell her what the night could not.

She slept. Or tried to.

Below her, on the second floor, in Dorm 3, in Bed 7, Connor Briggs lay with his thumb on the name LENA and stared at the ceiling and did not sleep. The ceiling fan turned. The building breathed. And in the wood beneath his hand, five letters carved by a girl he'd never met told him everything he needed to know about what came next.

The system was patient.

The system had done this before.

The system would do it again.
# Chapter 25: No Exit

The morning after the CCTV footage, Connor woke to the sound of the call to prayer and the certainty that he was finished.

Not the breezy, half-formed certainty of the past five weeks -- the certainty that things would be fine, that she'd be right, that Australia would protect him, that consequences were for people who lacked his particular brand of charm. This was the other kind. The geological kind. The kind that arrived when the last layer of sediment settled and the fossil record was complete and the thing that had been alive was now preserved in its final position, every bone accounted for, every joint locked, the posture of death fixed for anyone who cared to dig.

He lay in Bed 7 and stared at the ceiling. The fan turned. The blades chopped the amber light from the air well into slices -- light, shadow, light, shadow -- a rhythm that was neither comforting nor threatening but simply mechanical, the building's heartbeat, indifferent to the state of the bodies it sheltered.

The CCTV footage played behind his eyes. Felix had shown it to him last night on a laptop screen in Private Room 1 -- the screen angled like a confession booth's partition, the footage queued and timestamped, a curated retrospective of Connor's career as a drug mule. There he was at Wei's shop, entering through the front door, exiting with a brown paper package. There he was at the Sentul warehouse, red backpack on his shoulders, walking through the loading dock. There he was outside Danny's karaoke bar, handing over a shoebox-sized parcel to a man whose face was conveniently turned from the camera while Connor's was not. Fourteen clips. Fourteen deliveries. Fourteen individual pieces of evidence that, taken together, constructed a portrait so complete and so damning that no embassy, no lawyer, no amount of Australian passport privilege could dismantle it.

And then there was the name.

LENA.

He'd finally looked at the bed frame. Two nights ago, after Felix's revelation on the rooftop, after the numbers and the gloves and the suitcase to Penang, Connor had returned to Bed 7 and, for the first time in five weeks, run his fingers along the wooden edge where something had been scratched. The letters were crude, carved with a key or a nail, the wood splintered at the curves: L-E-N-A. Below the name, a date: 14/03/25. Below the date, a single word in Swedish that Connor couldn't read but that Priya later translated from a dictionary app, her voice going quiet as the meaning assembled itself: *forlat*. Forgive.

Lena Ekström. Twenty-two. Swedish. Bed 7 before Connor. Recruited by Felix six months before Connor arrived. Arrested carrying 200 grams of methamphetamine at the Thai-Malaysian border crossing at Bukit Kayu Hitam. Currently in Kajang Prison, forty kilometres south of KL, awaiting trial under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. Mandatory death penalty if convicted.

Felix had told him this with the same clinical precision he'd used for the CCTV footage -- a case study, a precedent, a data point in the operational history of a system that processed human beings the way Wei's vacuum sealer processed plastic bags: efficiently, completely, with no residual air.

"Lena was good," Felix had said. "Better than you, actually. More disciplined. She lasted four months. But she got emotional. Started asking questions. Started talking to other guests. She made the same mistake you're making -- she thought the exit was behind her. It's not. The exit is in front. One more job, and the exit opens."

The exit. The suitcase. Penang.

Connor rolled out of bed. The dorm was half-empty -- two beds occupied by travelers he didn't know, new arrivals who hadn't been here long enough to acquire names or histories or the grey, under-lit complexion that came from sleeping in Dorm 3's windowless depths. They were still in the early stage of hostel life, the stage Connor had occupied five weeks ago, when the Lantern was an adventure and Felix was a friend and the red lanterns were charming rather than ominous. They slept like people who had nothing to fear. Connor envied them with a violence that surprised him.

He dressed. Board shorts. A singlet that read BALI OR BUST in faded letters. Flip-flops. The uniform of a man who had curated his identity around not caring and was now trapped inside the costume, unable to change clothes because changing clothes would mean admitting that the costume had been a lie and the lie had been the architecture of his destruction.

The blue travel towel was under his pillow. He left it there.

---

He found Felix in the common room at nine, drinking black coffee from a tin mug and reading something on his phone with the focused attention of a man reviewing reports. The common room was quiet -- the mid-morning lull between breakfast chaos and the afternoon drift of returned day-trippers. The TV showed a cooking competition in Malay. The ceiling fans turned. The bookshelf of abandoned novels held its silent inventory of stories other people had left behind.

"I'm done," Connor said.

He said it standing. He said it without sitting down, without accepting the chair that the geography of their conversations had always assigned him, the subordinate chair, the chair that faced Felix's chair the way a student's desk faces the teacher's. He stood, and the standing was deliberate, and the deliberation was the first conscious act of resistance Connor had performed in five weeks.

Felix looked up from his phone. His expression didn't change. It didn't change because Felix's expression was a controlled variable, calibrated and maintained, the public interface of a system whose internal workings were not available for inspection. He set the phone face-down on the table.

"Sit down, Connor."

"No."

The word hung in the air. It was a small word, two letters, one syllable, and it was the first time Connor had deployed it against Felix. In five weeks of escalating favours and rationalised compliance and the steady downward slope of a man who had never learned to refuse, the word *no* had been absent from their vocabulary. Its appearance now was as conspicuous as a fire alarm in a library.

Felix studied him. The study was brief, clinical, the assessment of an engineer examining a component that had begun to deviate from its expected performance parameters.

"All right," Felix said. "Stand, then. It doesn't change anything."

"I'm done with the deliveries. I'm done with the packages. I'm done with Wei and Danny and the suitcase and Penang and all of it. I'm not carrying anything else for you."

Connor's voice was steady. Not confident -- confidence was a different architecture, built on certainty and self-regard, and Connor's self-regard had been demolished by the CCTV footage. But steady. The steadiness of a man who had run out of options for compliance and had found, at the bottom of that emptiness, the thin, cold floor of refusal.

Felix leaned back in his chair. He crossed one leg over the other. His leather sandals were clean, his linen shirt unwrinkled, his presence in the common room carrying the same effortless authority it had carried on the first night, when he'd materialised in this same space and offered Connor a beer and a future that was neither.

"I understand," Felix said. "You're scared. The footage upset you. Lena's story upset you. That's a normal reaction. I'd be worried if you weren't upset."

"I'm not upset. I'm done."

"You're done." Felix repeated the words the way a therapist repeats a patient's statement -- reflectively, without judgement, creating the space for the patient to hear their own words and recognise the emotion beneath them. "And what does 'done' look like, Connor? Practically. What does done look like tomorrow, next week, when you're sitting in this common room or standing at an immigration counter or walking through an airport?"

"I leave. I fly home. Melbourne. I'm gone."

"And the footage?"

The question was a nail. Quiet, precise, driven with a single tap into the exact centre of Connor's plan, the structural weakness that Connor had identified and chosen to ignore because ignoring structural weaknesses was what he did, it was his fundamental skill, the skill that had built his life and was now dismantling it.

"You wouldn't."

"I wouldn't need to. The footage exists on servers I don't control. Wei's shop has its own CCTV system -- the footage uploads automatically to a cloud service in Singapore. Mr. Tan's building has a security company that archives footage for twelve months. The Sentul warehouse uses a third-party monitoring service. I didn't create this surveillance architecture, Connor. I simply operated within it. The footage exists whether I want it to or not."

"Then delete it."

"I can't delete footage from systems I don't own. I can make certain that it doesn't reach the police. That's what I've been doing. That's what I'll continue to do, provided our arrangement continues."

The logic was airtight. The logic had always been airtight, because Felix built his systems the way engineers built bridges -- with redundancy, with failsafes, with the understanding that the structure must hold under stress. The CCTV footage was not leverage Felix held; it was leverage that existed independently, a natural consequence of Connor's actions, a trail that could not be unwalked. Felix's power was not that he could release the footage but that he could suppress it. He was not the threat. He was the shield against the threat. And the price of the shield was the suitcase.

Connor felt the refusal -- his two-letter, one-syllable act of resistance -- collide with the architecture of his entrapment and shatter. Not loudly. Not dramatically. The way ice cracks on a pond: a sound that belongs to the surface, while the water beneath continues, cold and dark and indifferent.

"One job," Felix said. "Penang. Then I suppress the footage permanently. I delete what I can access, and I ensure the rest is overwritten by time. Twelve months, the archive cycles. You'll be in Melbourne by then. The footage will be gone. You'll be free."

Free. The word was a trapdoor. It looked like solid ground, but the hinges were visible if you knew where to look, and Connor now knew where to look, and he could see the hinges, and beneath the trapdoor was the same void that had always been there -- the void of a system that processed people and discarded them when the processing was complete.

Connor opened his mouth to respond, but the staircase creaked -- the distinctive three-note groan of weight on old timber, the sound the building made when someone descended from the upper floors heavy-footed, load-bearing, the staircase protesting each step.

Uncle Razak appeared in the common room doorway.

---

Razak bin Omar was sixty-three years old and had owned the Lantern Hostel for seventeen years, and in those seventeen years he had perfected the art of knowing things he wished he didn't know.

He stood in the doorway in his usual outfit -- batik shirt, loose cotton trousers, leather sandals that slapped the tile with each step. His reading glasses were pushed up onto his forehead, catching the amber light from the paper lanterns. In his left hand, he held a rolled newspaper. In his right, nothing. But the nothing was the kind of nothing that occupies a hand that wants to hold something -- a weapon, a phone, a piece of paper that changes the terms of an arrangement.

His face was set in an expression Connor had never seen on him. In five weeks at the Lantern, Connor had seen Razak jovial (the default), conspiratorial (the office, the map, the red pins), melancholy (late nights on the rooftop, stories about the building's ghosts), and occasionally stern (a guest caught smoking inside, a noise complaint). But this expression was none of those. This was the expression of a man approaching a confrontation he had spent weeks avoiding and could no longer defer.

"Felix." Razak's voice was flat. The joviality stripped out, the way furniture is stripped from a room before it is demolished. "We need to talk."

Felix's posture didn't change. He remained in his chair, one leg crossed, coffee in hand, the picture of a man whose morning had not been interrupted. "Of course, Uncle. Sit down."

"Don't call me Uncle. Not today." Razak entered the common room. He did not sit. He stood where Connor had stood -- in the geography of refusal, the vertical space reserved for people who had come to say things they could not say from a seated position. "We had an agreement."

"We did."

"The agreement was clear. Your people don't recruit from my hostel. My guests are not your-- your *inventory*." The word came out with the particular venom of a man who had spent too long holding it in his mouth. "You do your business elsewhere. I don't see it. I don't report it. That was the deal."

"That was the deal," Felix agreed.

"You broke it."

Felix sipped his coffee. The sip was measured, unhurried, the act of a man who controlled the tempo of every conversation he entered. He set the mug down on the table with a soft click.

"Connor came to me," Felix said. "He was broke. He was desperate. He was asking anyone who would listen for ways to make money. I didn't recruit him, Razak. He applied."

"Bullshit." The English profanity in Razak's mouth was startling -- Razak, who defaulted to Malay for emotion, who spoke English with the measured courtesy of a man who had learned it as a tool of commerce. "Bullshit. I watched you. I watched you work him. The beer on the first night. The stories. The cash. The private room you use as an office. You recruited him the way you recruited Lena."

The name landed in the room like a stone in a still pond. Lena. The Swedish girl. Bed 7 before Connor. The name that was scratched into the wood. The name that connected the present to the past, the current victim to the previous one, the ongoing operation to its archive.

Felix's expression shifted -- a micro-adjustment, the barest contraction of the muscles around his eyes, the response of a man who had heard something he hadn't expected. Not Lena's name -- he knew Connor had learned about Lena. But Lena's name in Razak's mouth. That was different. That meant Razak had been paying closer attention than Felix had calculated.

"Lena was a different situation," Felix said.

"Lena was the same situation. You sat in my hostel. You drank my coffee. You used my wifi. You slept in my bed. And you fed my guests to your machine. That was not the arrangement."

Razak's voice had risen. Not to a shout -- Razak was not a shouting man -- but to a register that occupied the space between speech and declaration, the voice of a man making a formal accusation in a room that was not a courtroom but felt like one.

Connor stood frozen against the wall near the bookshelf. He was witnessing something he had not expected: the hostel owner, the man with the map of the dead, the collector of tragedies, confronting the architect of the current one. There was something almost noble in it -- Razak's anger, his refusal to remain complicit, his decision to cross the line between passive knowledge and active intervention.

The nobility lasted approximately forty-five seconds.

"You're going to stop," Razak said. "Today. Now. You're going to release this boy from whatever you've got him carrying, and then you're going to leave my hostel. If you don't, I'll call the police."

"The police." Felix set down his coffee. He uncrossed his legs. He stood. The standing was slow, deliberate, the vertical ascent of a man who had decided that the conversation required a different posture. "You'll call the police."

"Inspector Shah at Dang Wangi. I have his number. I'll call him now."

"And tell him what?"

"That you're running drugs through my property. That you're using my guests as couriers. That my hostel is being used as a base for--"

"For a trafficking operation that you've known about for two years."

The sentence cut Razak's speech like a scalpel. Clean, precise, the incision made at the exact point where the tissue was weakest.

Razak stopped. His mouth remained open for a moment -- the physical aftermath of a sentence that had been severed mid-delivery, the momentum of speech colliding with the sudden absence of words to carry it.

"Two years," Felix continued. His voice had not risen. It had not needed to. Volume was a tool for people who lacked precision, and Felix was nothing if not precise. "You've known about the network since before I arrived. You knew about the couriers. You knew about Wei's shop. You knew that Lena was carrying packages and you said nothing. You knew that the packages contained methamphetamine and you said nothing. You knew that Lena was arrested and you said nothing. You accepted a reduction in rent on your third-floor private room -- a room that costs sixty ringgit per night but that I pay one hundred and twenty for, a premium that you never questioned because questioning it would require you to acknowledge what the premium was purchasing."

Each sentence was a pin. Not the red pins on Razak's map -- not the pins that marked other people's deaths in other hostels in other countries. These were pins in Razak's own map, marking the points where his complicity had been documented, timestamped, archived.

"I've been here nine months," Felix said. "In those nine months, I've paid you RM32,400 in rent. Cash. No receipts. No tax declarations. An amount that, were the Inland Revenue Board to investigate, would reveal not only an unreported income stream but a pattern of financial behaviour that is, under Malaysian law, consistent with money laundering."

Razak's face changed. The anger drained from it the way colour drains from a sunset -- gradually, then all at once, leaving behind a landscape that was recognisable but fundamentally altered. What remained was not anger but something older: the expression of a man who has walked into a trap while believing he was springing one.

"Then there's the building," Felix said. "The rooftop terrace -- constructed in 2012 without a building permit. The fire escape on the second floor -- blocked by the storage room you converted into Private Room 2. The electrical wiring on the third floor -- substandard, uninspected, a violation of the Uniform Building By-Laws. The maximum occupancy rating for a structure of this type -- forty persons. You have forty-two beds. That's before we discuss the food preparation area and its compliance with the Food Act 1983, or the question of whether Mama Siti has a valid food handler's certificate."

Felix recited the violations the way a doctor recites symptoms -- systematically, without urgency, each item contributing to a diagnosis that was already known but had not yet been spoken aloud. He had done his research. He had done his research the way he did everything: thoroughly, patiently, with the understanding that information was currency and currency was power and power was the ability to stand in a man's common room and dismantle his moral authority piece by piece.

"You're a collector of dead backpackers, Razak." Felix's voice was quiet now, conversational, almost friendly -- the return of the charm, weaponised. "Would you like to add one from your own hostel?"

The question sat in the room. It sat between the ceiling fans and the cooking competition on the TV and the abandoned novels on the bookshelf. It sat in the amber light of the paper lanterns that Razak had hung himself, one by one, when he'd opened the Lantern in 2009 with the dream of creating a haven, a home away from home, a place where travelers could rest and be safe. The question sat on that dream and crushed it.

Razak looked at Felix. Felix looked at Razak. The look between them was not the look of enemies -- it was the look of two men who had made a transaction and were now confronting the terms, the fine print, the clauses that neither had wanted to read but both had signed.

"You knew." Razak's voice was barely audible. "You knew all of this before you moved in."

"I knew the building codes within the first week. The tax situation within the first month. The rest was observation. I'm a careful tenant, Razak. I pay attention to my home."

Home. The word was an obscenity in Felix's mouth -- the appropriation of a concept that Felix had no use for except as leverage, the linguistic equivalent of picking up a family photograph and holding it hostage.

Razak's hand -- the empty one, the one that had wanted to hold a weapon -- dropped to his side. His shoulders, which had been squared for the confrontation, settled into a different configuration, a lower one, the posture of a man absorbing a blow to the body rather than the face. The newspaper in his other hand crumpled slightly as his grip tightened, then loosened, then tightened again -- the physical syntax of a decision being made and unmade and made again in the space between breaths.

"What do you want?" Razak said.

It was the same question Connor had asked on the rooftop. The same two notes, the same defeated melody, the sound of a man who has run out of cards and is asking to see the dealer's hand.

"I want what I've always wanted. To conduct my business without interference. To use Private Room 1. To come and go without questions. And to have one more conversation with Connor about a suitcase."

Razak looked at Connor. The look was the worst part -- worse than Felix's leverage, worse than the building code violations, worse than the tax evasion. The look was apologetic. It was the look of a man who had come downstairs to rescue someone and was leaving without having rescued anyone, including himself.

"I'm sorry, anak," Razak said. *Anak.* Child. The Malay word for the thing you protect, the thing you fail to protect, the thing whose suffering you carry because carrying it is all you can do when you cannot prevent it.

He turned. He walked to the staircase. The building groaned as he ascended -- the three-note creak of old wood under the weight of a man who was heavier now than when he'd descended, heavier with the knowledge that he had made a bargain with a devil and the devil had kept better records.

The common room was quiet. The cooking competition played. The ceiling fans turned. And Felix sat back down and picked up his coffee and drank it as though nothing had happened, because for Felix, nothing had. The confrontation was a line item, a risk managed, a variable controlled. It had consumed twelve minutes of his morning and would not consume twelve more.

Connor stood against the bookshelf and watched the man who owned his fate drink coffee with the placid satisfaction of someone who has won an argument by never raising his voice.

---

The hours after Razak's retreat were the longest of Connor's life. Longer than the overnight flight from Melbourne to Bali four years ago, when he'd sat in 43C and vibrated with the excitement of a life about to begin. Longer than the wait for his A-level results, which he'd failed, which his parents had absorbed with the quiet disappointment of people who had expected exactly this. Longer than any night in any hostel in any country, because the thing he was waiting for was not arrival or departure or results but the clarification of a future that had narrowed to a corridor with no doors.

He sat on the rooftop. The plastic chair was warm from the afternoon sun. The humidity pressed against his skin like something worn. Below, Petaling Street conducted its daily commerce -- the market stalls, the phone repair shops, the Chinese medicine stores, the temple with its incense and its bells, the ordinary infrastructure of a city that did not know or care that one of its residents was sitting on an illegal rooftop terrace trying to decide whether to run.

Running. The word circled his mind like a bird over wreckage -- orbiting, descending, never landing. He could run. He could pack his bag -- the backpack with the compass tattoo's twin, the backpack that had carried him through twelve countries and now carried the weight of fourteen deliveries. He could walk to KL Sentral, buy a ticket to the airport, and be on a plane to Melbourne before Felix finished his coffee. He could be in Hawthorn by tomorrow night, in his childhood bedroom, in the bed that still had the Manchester United duvet from when he was fifteen, and the whole thing -- Felix, the packages, the CCTV, Lena, the suitcase -- would be behind him.

Except it wouldn't. The footage existed on servers in Singapore. The bank transfers existed in systems that crossed borders. The evidence was digital, distributed, persistent -- it lived in the cloud, and the cloud was everywhere, and everywhere was exactly where Connor would be when the footage surfaced. It could surface tomorrow or in six months or in two years. It could surface when he applied for a job and a background check flagged his name. It could surface when he tried to enter another country and an immigration database connected his face to a CCTV still from a phone repair shop in Chinatown. It could surface when a Malaysian investigation into the trafficking network reached the archive footage and there, on a screen in a police station, was Connor James Briggs, walking through a door with a package that contained methamphetamine, his face clear, his intent evident, his guilt preserved in 1080p resolution.

Running solved nothing. Running deferred. And the deferral had a cost, because the cost of the footage was not what it could do to him now but what it could do to him later, in a future that extended decades beyond this rooftop, this city, this afternoon.

His phone buzzed. Not the burner -- his real phone, the cracked iPhone with the sunset wallpaper and the Instagram icon and the 4,200 followers who thought he was living his best life. A message from an unknown number.

*Connor. It's Priya. I'm using the hostel computer to message you. I need to see you. The courtyard. Twenty minutes. Don't tell Felix. Please.*

He read it twice. The message was different from Priya's usual communication -- no emojis, no exclamation marks, no warmth. The tone was clinical, urgent, the tone of a medical student reporting a critical finding.

He descended. The staircase creaked. The building noted his passage and filed it with the others -- the thousands of descents by the thousands of guests who had walked these stairs over ninety-eight years, each one recorded in the wood's memory, each one a variation on the same theme: a person moving through a building that would outlast them.

---

The courtyard was the Lantern's heart -- the air well that cut through the centre of the shophouse, open to the sky, the walls rising three stories on all sides like the interior of a well. The mosaic tile bench sat beneath a frangipani tree whose roots had cracked the tiles decades ago and whose branches now reached toward the square of sky above with the slow ambition of something that had learned to grow in confined spaces. Laundry lines crisscrossed the air well at the second-floor level, strung with the drying garments of travelers -- a batik sarong, a pair of board shorts, a sports bra, a Tottenham Hotspur jersey. The light came from above, filtered through the laundry and the frangipani and the humid air, arriving at ground level as something diffuse and green, the light of an aquarium.

Priya was already there. She sat on the bench in jeans and a white T-shirt, her hair braided, her glasses pushed up her nose, her hands holding a phone that was not her own. It was a prepaid phone, the kind you bought at a 7-Eleven for thirty ringgit, the kind that had no history and no future and existed only for the transaction it was purchased to facilitate.

"Sit," she said.

He sat. The bench was cool despite the heat -- the mosaic tiles holding the morning's chill, the frangipani's shade doing its work. Above, the square of sky was white with humidity, the sun behind the cloud cover like a lamp behind gauze.

"I have a plan," Priya said.

She said it the way she said everything now -- without preamble, without the soft approach she'd used in the early weeks when she'd been trying to warn him without scaring him. The soft approach was over. The soft approach had been a luxury of a time when the danger was theoretical. The danger was no longer theoretical. The danger had a face and a name and a suitcase.

"The Australian embassy is on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng. Twenty minutes from here by Grab. I've looked up their services. They provide consular assistance to Australian citizens in distress, including -- and I'm reading this directly -- 'Australians who find themselves in legal difficulty or who believe they are being coerced into illegal activity.'"

She showed him the phone's screen. The embassy website, loaded in a browser, the Australian coat of arms at the top -- the kangaroo and the emu, the animals that could not walk backwards, the national emblem of a country that was supposed to move forward and protect its own and provide the safety net that Connor had never believed he needed until the floor dropped.

"If you walk in there and tell them everything -- Felix, the packages, the CCTV, the suitcase -- they can help you. They can contact the Malaysian police through diplomatic channels. They can arrange for your evidence to be given in a way that protects you as a witness rather than prosecutes you as a suspect. They can get you home."

The plan was coherent. The plan was intelligent. The plan was the product of a fourth-year medical student's mind -- analytical, systematic, following the diagnostic pathway from symptom to treatment with the rigour that her training demanded.

"I've booked a Grab for 4 PM," Priya continued. "I'm coming with you. We go in together. You tell them everything. If they can't help immediately, we ask for asylum in the embassy -- I don't know if that's actually how it works, but we ask. We don't leave until there's a plan. A real plan. Not Felix's plan. A plan that gets you out of this alive."

Connor looked at her. She was magnificent in her determination -- the glasses, the braid, the phone held like a weapon, the jaw set -- locked, forward, the jaw of a person who has decided to save someone and will not be dissuaded. She was everything he had failed to be: careful, courageous, willing to do the hard thing instead of the easy one. She was his opposite, his complement, the person he would have been if he had been better, and her plan was the door he should have walked through weeks ago.

"Okay," he said.

The word came out small. Not the performative *okay* of the common room, the *okay* that Priya had celebrated and Felix had overridden. This was smaller, quieter, the *okay* of a man who had been reduced to his simplest components and was operating on the last of something -- hope, energy, the residual human impulse to survive.

"Okay," Priya repeated. She smiled. The smile was brief, cautious, the smile of a doctor who has seen a positive test result but knows that the treatment is still ahead. "Four o'clock. I'll meet you here. Bring your passport and any documentation you have. Leave the burner phone in the dorm."

"Priya."

"Yes."

"If this doesn't work--"

"It will work."

"If it doesn't. If Felix finds out. If the footage--"

"Connor." She put her hand on his. The jade bracelet -- the one he'd bought her at the night market, in a different life, in a life where he was a tourist buying a gift for a girl and not a drug mule planning an escape -- rested between their wrists. "It will work. I'm not going to let this happen to you."

He almost believed her. He almost believed her the way a drowning man almost believes the rope that appears above him -- wanting to believe, needing to believe, the belief itself a form of oxygen. He almost reached for the rope.

His pocket buzzed.

The burner phone. The phone Felix had given him on Day 15 with the instructions and the schedule and the contacts. The phone that was a leash disguised as a tool, a chain disguised as a convenience.

He pulled it out. Priya's eyes followed the phone, tracked it from his pocket to his palm, watched the screen illuminate with the sick recognition of someone who has seen this device before and knows what it means.

A message from Felix. No text. Just a photograph.

The photograph was a CCTV still. The timestamp read 14:47, three days ago. The location was the entrance to Wei's phone repair shop. In the image, a figure in board shorts and a faded singlet was walking through the door carrying a daypack. The figure's face was clear -- the sun-bleached hair, the perpetual squint, the compass tattoo on the exposed forearm. Below the image, a single word:

*Remember.*

Connor stared at the photograph. The photograph stared back. It was him. It was incontrovertibly, irrefutably, permanently him. Not a version of him, not an approximation, not a figure that could be mistaken for someone else. It was Connor James Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian, entering a drug packaging facility in Chinatown, Kuala Lumpur, on a date and at a time that could be verified against delivery records and payment transfers and the testimony of every person who had handled the packages he'd carried.

The rope above the drowning man dissolved.

"What is it?" Priya reached for the phone. He let her take it. She looked at the screen. Her expression underwent the journey from hope to understanding to a stillness -- held, heavy, the stillness of someone who has just measured the size of what they're fighting and found it larger than themselves.

"He's watching," she said. Not a question. A diagnosis.

"He's always watching."

Priya set the phone on the bench between them. The CCTV still glowed on the small screen, Connor's pixelated face staring upward at the sky like a man looking for something that wasn't there.

"The embassy plan--" she started.

"He'll know. He'll know I'm going. He'll know before I get there. He knows everything, Priya. He knew about Razak before Razak even came downstairs this morning. He knew about Tomoko's photos before she showed them to me. He has cameras, contacts, people. If I walk into the embassy, the footage goes to the police. Not tomorrow. Today. Before I can explain. Before I can tell my side. The footage goes, and the footage is a death sentence."

He was not being dramatic. He was being accurate. Under Section 39B, the footage of Connor carrying packages from a known drug packaging facility was presumptive evidence of trafficking. The presumption was rebuttable -- in theory, in a courtroom, with a lawyer, over months of legal proceedings. But the footage's release would trigger his arrest, and his arrest would place him in the Malaysian criminal justice system, and the system was not designed for nuance or for the protestation of Australian backpackers who claimed they didn't know what they were carrying. The system was designed for processing. The system was designed for results. The system was, as Priya herself had told him in Chapter 14, a machine that, once activated, was nearly impossible to stop.

"Then what?" Priya said. "What's your plan? Carry the suitcase? Do the job? Trust Felix to let you go?"

"I don't have a plan."

"That's not good enough."

"I know."

They sat on the bench in the courtyard and the frangipani dropped a flower -- a single white petal, spiralling down through the air well's enclosed atmosphere, landing on the mosaic tiles between their feet. The petal was perfect, unblemished, fallen not because of damage but because the tree was programmed to release, and the releasing was part of the cycle, and the cycle was indifferent to the petal's condition. Things fell because falling was what they did when the structure that held them was no longer sufficient.

Priya stood. She picked up the prepaid phone. She looked at Connor with an expression that contained the entire architecture of their relationship -- the attraction, the warning, the love, the frustration, the diagnosis, the prognosis.

"I'm cancelling the Grab," she said. "But I'm not giving up. I need to think. There has to be a way that doesn't depend on Felix letting you go and doesn't require you to walk into the police with the footage still out there."

She left. The courtyard held her absence the way it held everything -- in the mosaic tiles, in the frangipani branches, in the laundry that dried slowly in the humid air. Connor sat on the bench and held the burner phone and the CCTV still of himself and felt the last escape route seal shut with the quiet precision of a door closing in a hospital, the rubber seal meeting the frame, the click of the mechanism engaging, the air on the other side becoming inaccessible.

---

Upstairs, in his office on the second floor, Razak bin Omar sat at his desk and stared at the map of the dead.

The map covered most of the wall behind his desk -- a large-format world map, the kind sold in educational supply stores, the continents in muted greens and browns, the oceans in pale blue. Red pins marked the locations of hostel deaths he had collected over seventeen years. There were sixty-three pins. Buenos Aires, three. Bangkok, seven. Barcelona, two. Berlin, one. Hanoi, four. Kathmandu, two. Each pin was a story. Each story was a death. Each death was a failure -- of awareness, of precaution, of the basic survival instinct that travelers abandoned when they crossed borders and entered the liminal space of the hostel, the space between home and away, the space where the rules of one world no longer applied and the rules of the other had not yet been learned.

He had started the collection in 2009, when the hostel opened. A guest in the first year had fallen from a balcony in Siem Reap before coming to the Lantern -- she'd told the story in the common room, the balcony railing that gave way, the three-story fall, the hospital in Phnom Penh. Razak had been horrified and fascinated. He'd found the news article online. He'd printed it. He'd put a pin in Cambodia. And the collection had grown, article by article, death by death, until the map was not a collection but a cartography of vulnerability, a visual record of what happened when people traveled without understanding where they were.

He had never imagined that a pin would go in Kuala Lumpur. He had never imagined that the pin would be for his own hostel.

But the pin was coming. He could feel it in the building's bones, in the creak of the staircase, in the way Mama Siti had stopped singing in the kitchen, in the way Aziz stood in the alley and smoked with the particular intensity of a man who was watching something approach and had decided not to move.

Felix had won. The admission was bitter, metallic, the taste of a coin held too long in the mouth. Felix had won because Felix had prepared, and Razak had not prepared, because Razak had believed that the arrangement -- the tacit agreement, the gentleman's understanding -- was sufficient protection against a man who was not a gentleman and did not understand things but engineered them.

The building code violations. The rooftop terrace. The fire escape. The wiring. The occupancy rating. The tax evasion. The cash payments. Each item was real. Each item was a violation that Razak had committed knowingly, with the rationalisation that every small business owner in this neighbourhood made the same compromises, that the enforcement was selective, that the hostel was safe enough, that the fire escape being blocked by Private Room 2 was a temporary arrangement that had lasted four years.

Felix had catalogued these violations the way a man catalogues ammunition -- carefully, completely, with the understanding that each round served a specific purpose and the magazine was full.

And then the final round: complicity. Two years of knowing about the trafficking network. Two years of accepting the premium rent. Two years of watching packages move through the neighbourhood and saying nothing, reporting nothing, intervening not at all. Two years during which Lena Ekström had been recruited, trained, deployed, arrested, and imprisoned, and Razak had known about every stage and had acted on none.

If he called Inspector Shah, Felix would counter-report. The building violations would generate an investigation. The tax evasion would generate an audit. And the complicity -- the knowledge of trafficking, the acceptance of premium rent, the silence -- would generate charges. Not drug trafficking charges, not the capital offence that faced Connor, but abetment charges, obstruction charges, the kind of charges that closed businesses and destroyed reputations and sent sixty-three-year-old men to prison for the remainder of their relevance.

Razak looked at the map. Sixty-three pins. Sixty-three stories of travelers who had died in places that should have been safe. He had collected them with the detachment of a historian, the careful distance of a man who studied catastrophe without participating in it. But the distance was gone now. The catastrophe was in his building. The catastrophe slept in Private Room 1 and drank coffee in his common room and had just demonstrated, with clinical precision, that the collector of dead backpackers was also, and had always been, a participant.

He opened his desk drawer. Inside, beneath the guest ledgers and the receipt books and the building insurance policy that was three months expired, there was a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label that he kept for emergencies. This qualified. He poured two fingers into a tea glass and drank it in one motion and felt the whisky burn a path from his throat to his stomach and the burning was the only honest sensation he'd felt all morning.

On the desk, his phone sat beside the rolled newspaper. Inspector Shah's number was in his contacts. It had been there for years, a safety measure, the emergency glass to break in case of fire. The glass was still intact. The fire was burning. And Razak could not break the glass because the glass, it turned out, was also the wall that kept his own house standing.

He poured another two fingers. He drank them. He looked at the map and found Malaysia and found Kuala Lumpur and found the approximate location of Petaling Street and imagined a pin -- red, small, definitive -- pushed into the paper at the exact point where his hostel stood.

The pin was not there yet. But the pin was coming. And Razak could see it with the clarity of a man who had spent seventeen years studying the pattern and was now, for the first time, inside it.

---

At 6:47 PM, the call to prayer from Masjid Jamek carried across the rooftops of Chinatown, and the city paused -- not stopping, never stopping, but modulating, the traffic dimming slightly, the market voices lowering, the great machine of KL acknowledging something larger than commerce for four minutes and thirty seconds before resuming.

Connor sat in the common room. Priya sat in the courtyard. Razak sat in his office. Three people in three rooms of the same building, separated by floors and walls and the particular loneliness of people who share a crisis but cannot share a solution.

Felix was not in the building. He had left at noon -- his leather sandals on the staircase, his linen shirt passing through the common room, his exit as smooth and unhurried as his entrance had been nine months ago. Where he went, no one asked. What he did, no one questioned. He would return. He always returned. The building was his, in every way that mattered except the deed.

In the dorm, Bed 7 held Connor's belongings: the backpack, the cracked iPhone, the blue travel towel, the copy of *The Beach*, the compass tattoo's echo in the braided leather bracelet on the bedpost. On the bed frame, Lena's name waited in the wood. On the mattress, the thin foam held the impression of two bodies -- Lena's and Connor's -- layered like geological strata, the Swedish girl and the Australian boy, different people separated by months and connected by the mechanism that had used them both.

The burner phone sat in Connor's pocket. The CCTV still sat in the burner phone's memory. The suitcase sat in a future that was approaching at the speed of Felix's schedule.

And somewhere in the building, Mama Siti moved through the kitchen in the particular silence of a woman who had stopped singing, and the silence was louder than any song, and the building heard it, and the building understood, because the building had been here before -- in 1943, when the Japanese used the second floor for purposes that left marks in the plaster, and in 1972, when the brothel's clients made sounds that the walls absorbed and never released, and in 2009, when Razak had opened the doors and hung the lanterns and believed that the building's history could be overwritten by hospitality.

The history could not be overwritten. The history was the building. And the building was patient, and the building was waiting, and the building knew -- the way old buildings in the tropics know things, through their damp walls and cracked tiles and settling foundations -- that the red pin was coming.

The ceiling fans turned.

The lanterns glowed.

And somewhere in Kuala Lumpur, a suitcase was being prepared.
# Chapter 26: Countdown

Seven days.

Priya's flight to London departed in seven days, and the number had become a physical presence in the hostel -- not spoken aloud but felt, the way barometric pressure was felt, a weight in the air that changed the behaviour of everything beneath it. Seven days until the last person who loved Connor Briggs left the building, left the city, left the hemisphere. Seven days until the only voices that remained were the ones that wanted something from him.

Connor counted the days the way prisoners counted days, which was ironic in a way that was not funny, because the counting was preparation for a different kind of captivity, the kind that didn't have walls but had the same effect -- the narrowing of options, the elimination of movement, the slow compression of a life into a single corridor with a single door at the end.

Day 40. Six days to Priya's flight. Four days -- Felix had said "a few days" -- to the final job.

---

The hostel had changed.

Not physically -- the red lanterns still glowed, the ceiling fans still turned, Mama Siti still produced nasi lemak from the kitchen as though the coconut rice was a natural law rather than a recipe. The bookshelf still held its rotating library of abandoned novels. The TV still played to empty rooms. The building was the same building it had been since 1928, the same walls, the same tiles, the same Japanese characters under paint on the second-floor landing.

But the atmosphere had shifted. The hostel felt watched. Not by cameras -- though cameras were part of it, Wei's cameras, the silent electronic eyes that had recorded Connor's every pickup -- but by the building itself, by the accumulated weight of a structure that had held so many bodies and so many secrets that the holding had become a kind of attention. The staircase creaked differently. The air well's acoustics had changed, amplifying sounds that had previously been absorbed -- a door closing, a phone buzzing, footsteps on the third floor at hours when the third floor should have been silent.

Connor moved through the building like a man navigating a minefield. Every interaction was loaded. Mei Ling's glance when he passed reception -- was it the glance of a woman who knew, or the glance of a woman who suspected, or the glance of a woman who was simply doing her job? Aziz, fixing a light fitting in the corridor, his ex-cop eyes tracking Connor with the flat assessment of a man who had spent decades reading bodies for guilt -- what did Aziz see? What had Aziz always seen?

Mama Siti served nasi lemak in silence. The silence was not unusual -- Mama Siti's relationship with silence was the relationship of a woman who had said everything she needed to say and was now waiting for the world to catch up. But the silence felt different now. It felt like the silence of someone sitting vigil.

Connor ate. The rice was perfect. The sambal burned. He tasted nothing.

---

The days compressed.

Day 41. Five days to Priya's flight. Connor did not make a delivery. The schedule had been suspended -- Felix had told him the regular drops were on hold "while we prepare for the final job." The suspension should have been a relief. Instead, it was a void -- the absence of the routine exposing the anxiety beneath it, the way removing a bandage exposed the wound.

He spent the day with Priya. They went to the National Mosque -- Masjid Negara, its modernist geometry rising against the sky in blue and white, the star-shaped roof folding outward in sixteen points like something designed by an architect who had looked at the sky and decided to build an answer. The building was enormous and angular and somehow weightless, its lines clean in a way Connor associated with airports and hospitals -- the architecture of institutions that processed humans at scale -- but here the processing was different, the processing was vertical, aimed upward, and the scale was not bureaucratic but devotional. The reflecting pool outside held the mosque's inverted image with a stillness so complete that it seemed less like water than like a second building, a mirror mosque submerged just beneath the surface, waiting.

They removed their shoes at the entrance. Priya wrapped herself in a borrowed robe; Connor was given a purple robe that made him look, Priya said, like a "very confused wizard."

Inside, the mosque was vast and cool and silent. The prayer hall stretched before them, the carpet thick and soft, the dome above creating an acoustic space that turned whispers into echoes and echoes into something close to music. Light entered through geometric screens -- blue, green, gold -- and fell on the carpet in patterns that shifted as the sun moved, the kind of slow, celestial motion that reminded you that time existed at a scale far larger than a human life. The screens themselves were works of mathematical precision, the geometric lattice repeating in patterns that contained no figures, no faces, no images of the living world -- only shapes, only the pure abstraction of form arranged according to rules that predated the building by centuries. Octagons nested inside octagons. Stars radiated from invisible centres. The light that passed through the screens was not merely filtered but translated, converted from the raw equatorial blaze outside into something coded, ordered, a language of illumination that fell across the carpet and across the two of them in shapes that were exact and beautiful and indifferent to the chaos they carried inside their borrowed robes.

They sat on the carpet. They didn't speak. The mosque held them the way the temple had held Connor weeks ago -- with the quiet authority of a space designed for the dissolution of the ego, for the reminder that the self was small and the world was large and the distance between them was the space in which faith lived.

Connor felt something in his chest -- not the fear, not the tremor, but something older, something from before the packages and the phones and the machine. A feeling that had no name in the vocabulary he used, the vocabulary of *sick* and *legend* and *she'll be right*. In a different life, in a different version of himself, he might have called it sorrow. In this life, in this version, he called it nothing, because naming it would have required a capacity for self-examination that the past five weeks had eroded to nothing.

The mosque gave him what the machine could not: stillness. Not the false stillness of denial, not the anaesthetic stillness of deciding not to think, but the genuine article, the stillness of a space so large and so quiet and so indifferent to his particular suffering that the suffering, for a few minutes, became proportional. Small. A single human problem in a room built for the contemplation of the infinite. He breathed. The air smelled of nothing -- not the damp wood of the hostel, not the diesel of Petaling Street, not the chemical smell of Wei's shop. Clean air. Air that had been through the geometric screens and come out purified, reduced to its essential function: the keeping alive of the body.

Priya's hand found his. The jade bracelet was cool on his wrist. She was looking at the dome, at the light, at the patterns on the carpet, and her expression was the expression of a woman memorising something -- storing the details in a place where they could be retrieved later, when the original was no longer available.

"I don't want to leave you here," she said.

The words arrived softly, almost lost in the acoustic vastness of the prayer hall. Connor heard them. He let a breath pass before answering. In the pause, the light shifted on the carpet -- one of the geometric patterns elongating as the sun moved, the octagon stretching toward an oval, the mathematics of the screen interacting with the mathematics of the earth's rotation to produce a slow, silent deformation.

"I know."

"Come with me. London. We'll sort everything else from there."

Another pause. He looked at the dome. The dome looked back with the benign indifference of a structure that had sheltered thousands of people and their thousands of problems and had not solved any of them, because solving was not its function. Holding was its function. Containing.

"Felix has the footage. If I run, the footage goes to the police. I'm arrested at the airport, or at Heathrow, or the Malaysian police send a request to Interpol and I'm arrested in London. The footage follows me."

What he did not say: that he had considered it. That he had lain awake in Bed 7 and constructed the London escape in detail -- the Grab to KLIA, the ticket on AirAsia or Malaysia Airlines or anything with wings, the flight path northwest over the Indian Ocean, Priya beside him, her hand on his arm during turbulence, Heathrow's fluorescent corridors, the Tube to wherever she lived, a sofa, a cup of tea, the illusion of safety. He had built the entire fantasy and then he had dismantled it, piece by piece, because each piece depended on Felix not acting, and Felix always acted.

"You don't know that," she said.

"Felix knows that. Felix knows everything."

She held his hand tighter. The mosque was silent. The light moved on the carpet. A pattern that had been falling on Connor's knee migrated to the carpet beside him, leaving his leg in shadow, the warmth replaced by the ambient cool of the prayer hall. And two people sat on holy ground and discussed the mechanics of a trap with the quiet, exhausted precision of people who had tried everything and found everything insufficient.

---

Day 42. Four days.

Connor's phone buzzed. Not the burner -- the real phone. Instagram notification. He opened it.

@HostelReaper had posted a new photo.

The account -- the one he'd seen on his explore feed weeks ago, the one he'd photographed as graffiti on a Chinatown wall -- had posted an image. The image was a single bunk bed in a hostel dorm, shot from above, the mattress bare, a blue towel draped across the pillow. The composition was careful, almost beautiful -- the light falling through an air well onto the bed, the wood of the frame catching the glow, the towel vivid against the grey mattress.

The caption read: *Bed 7. Dorm 3. The Lantern Hostel, KL. Still warm. #LocalLaw #101Ways #CheckoutIsMandatory*

Connor stared at the photo. The photo was his bed. The exact bed he was sitting on. The photo had been taken from above -- from the upper bunk, or from a standing position beside the bed -- and the angle showed the bed frame, and the mattress, and the blue towel that was his blue towel, the Sea to Summit that had been with him through twelve countries.

The photo had been posted six hours ago. It had three likes. The account had no profile picture, no bio, no other posts except the one he'd seen before -- the backpack on a bus seat with the caption *Another one packed for the journey. #NoReturn*.

Someone had been in his dorm. Someone had photographed his bed. Someone knew his name, his hostel, his room, his bed number, and the colour of his towel.

Connor's hands were steady. This surprised him. The tremor that had been his constant companion since the back room at Wei's shop was absent. In its place was something else -- a stillness that was not calm but was the body's response to overload, the circuit-breaker tripping, the system shutting down non-essential functions to preserve the core.

He screenshot the post. He looked at the account again. @HostelReaper. No followers that mattered. No history that explained. Just two posts, both about death, both about hostels, both about the specific, personal details of someone's last days in a building designed for temporary occupancy.

He deleted the screenshot. He put the phone down. He looked at his bed -- the thin mattress, the vinyl surface, the wooden frame, the stickers on the bunk above. Everything was normal. Everything was exactly as it had been every morning for six weeks. And everything was different, because the bed was no longer just a bed. The bed was photographed, catalogued, posted to an account that tracked deaths in hostels the way Uncle Razak tracked deaths on his map, and the bed was his bed, and the towel was his towel, and the hashtag was #LocalLaw, and the local law said death.

---

Day 43. Three days.

He tried to be normal. He went to Grind Culture -- the café two blocks from the hostel, the one with the reclaimed-wood tables and the single-origin pour-over menu and the neon sign above the bar that read HUSTLE in cursive, because irony was dead and no one had told the sign. The café was full of the usual congregation: freelancers and digital nomads hunched over laptops, earbuds in, faces bathed in the blue glow of screens displaying spreadsheets and Slack channels and WordPress dashboards, each one a citizen of the borderless nation of people who had traded cubicles for cafés and called it liberation. Connor had been one of them, or had pretended to be one of them, which in the digital nomad economy amounted to the same thing.

He ordered the flat white. He opened his laptop. He stared at the Pacific Soul Retreats account and saw nothing -- the content, the captions, the scheduled posts, the entire infrastructure of his fake career dissolving into irrelevance the way sandcastles dissolved in tides. The cursor blinked on a draft caption for a Bali sunset he'd photographed three weeks ago. The caption read: *Golden hour hits different when your office is the world.* He stared at the words and the words stared back and neither of them had anything left to say to each other.

He texted his mother.

*Hey Mum. Just checking in. Everything's good here. KL is beautiful. Love you.*

She replied in four minutes.

*Hi darling! So glad to hear from you. Dad says hello. He's feeling much better. Megan is coming for dinner on Sunday -- wish you could be here. Are you eating well? Please call soon. Love Mum xxx*

Connor read the text. He read it again. He read it a third time, and on each reading the individual details landed separately, each one a small, precise blow to a part of him he had spent five weeks trying to anaesthetise. *Dad says hello* -- his father, David, the property developer who deposited two thousand dollars into Connor's account every month without being asked and without complaint, the man who had replaced "if you come home" with "when you come home" and whose quiet recalibration of that pronoun was the most heartbreaking thing Connor had ever failed to notice. *He's feeling much better* -- better from what? Connor didn't know. He hadn't asked. He hadn't called in three weeks and in those three weeks his father had been unwell and had recovered and Connor had known nothing about either event because knowing would have required calling and calling would have required being a person who called and he was not that person, he was the other kind, the kind who texted *everything's good* from a café in a city where everything was the opposite of good. *Megan is coming for dinner on Sunday* -- Megan, his sister, the accountant, the responsible one, the one who showed up, who called, who brought wine to Sunday dinner and sat in the chair Connor's absence had made permanently available. *Are you eating well?* -- the question every mother asked, the question that was never about food but about survival, about the body's continuation, about whether the child was maintaining the physical structure the mother had built and released into the world with the implicit understanding that the structure would be maintained.

Connor read the text a third time and on the third reading the words blurred and his eyes were wet and he was sitting in a hipster café in Kuala Lumpur crying over a text from his mother, the tears falling on the wooden table between the MacBook and the flat white, and the barista with the man-bun looked over and looked away with the practiced non-observation of a man who had seen emotions in cafés before and had decided that emotions were not his department. Around Connor, the freelancers typed and sipped and hustled, each one sealed inside their own narrative, and Connor cried in the middle of them the way a man bleeds in a crowd -- visibly, but without witnesses, because witnessing required looking and looking required caring and caring was not a feature of the co-working café experience.

He wiped his eyes. He typed: *Tell Dad I love him. Tell Megs too. I'll call Sunday. Promise.*

He would not call Sunday. By Sunday he would be on a bus to Penang, or in a cell at Dang Wangi, or somewhere in between, and the phone call to his mother -- the phone call he should have been making every week, the phone call she waited for and he avoided and the avoiding was the cruelest thing he'd ever done because it was the cruelest thing children did to parents: not hating them, not fighting them, but simply forgetting them, the slow, painless forgetting that was worse than any argument -- that phone call would not happen.

He closed the laptop. He left the café. He walked through Petaling Street in the afternoon heat and the heat was a wall and the wall was everywhere and the humidity sat on his skin like something applied, a second layer he could not remove. The market stalls were open on both sides of the covered street, the green tarpaulins overhead filtering the sun into a submarine murk, and the vendors called out in Cantonese and English and Malay -- *copy watch, you want?* and *best price, best price* -- and the smell was the usual Petaling Street amalgam of fried noodles and incense and diesel and the sweet, heavy rot of durian from the fruit stall near the corner. Tourists moved through the covered walkway in pairs and groups, photographing the red lanterns and the Chinese signage with the delighted absorption of people for whom this street was a spectacle and not, as it was for Connor, a corridor. He moved among them. He was indistinguishable from them -- another Westerner in board shorts, another body navigating the market, another pair of flip-flops on the cracked tile. And none of them knew. None of them could have guessed, looking at him, that the man brushing past their elbows was carrying inside his chest a secret that would horrify every one of them -- a secret about packages and suitcases and CCTV footage and a law that carried a sentence measured not in years but in the absence of years, the permanent subtraction of all future time. He walked through the crowd and the crowd parted and reformed around him and the city was beautiful and the city was killing him and the killing was so slow and so gentle that it felt, from certain angles, like living.

---

Day 44. Two days.

Felix texted the burner phone at seven AM.

*The job is in two days. Friday. Details tomorrow. Be ready.*

Connor read the message. The words were grey on the burner's cheap screen, the font small and sans-serif, and the physical sensation of reading them was not in his eyes but in his stomach -- a dropping, a hollowing, the body's recognition of finality arriving before the mind could process it. Two days. The phrase had the weight of a medical diagnosis, the kind delivered in a quiet room with a box of tissues on the desk. He deleted the message. He put the phone under his pillow, beside the blue towel that was always there now, the Sea to Summit that had been photographed by @HostelReaper, the towel that was no longer just a towel but an exhibit, a prop in someone else's narrative.

He lay in Bed 7 and stared at the ceiling and counted the hours.

Forty-eight hours. Two thousand eight hundred and eighty minutes. One hundred seventy-two thousand eight hundred seconds. Each one a unit of time in which he could act -- could call Ahmad, could go to the embassy, could walk to the airport and buy a ticket and leave. Each second was an exit. Each second was an opportunity. Each second ticked past and became the previous second and the opportunity closed and the next second arrived and the next opportunity opened and the next opportunity closed and the ticking was the ceiling fan and the ticking was the clock and the ticking was the countdown to something that could not be stopped because the only person who could stop it was the person who had decided, through five weeks of accumulated choices, not to stop it.

He got up. He showered. He ate breakfast. He moved through the day the way a ghost moves through a building -- present but not participating, visible but not substantial, occupying space without filling it.

Tomoko was in the common room. She was on the sofa with her laptop, typing with the focused velocity of a person transcribing something urgent, her fingers striking the keys in short, decisive bursts separated by pauses in which she stared at the screen and her lips moved slightly, testing a sentence before committing it. Her new camera -- a Sony, cheaper than the Nikon that Felix's associates had stolen, purchased with her own money at a shop in Low Yat Plaza -- sat on the cushion beside her, the lens cap off, the strap coiled. She had been shooting again. Whatever she had lost when the Nikon was taken, she had replaced -- not the images, those were gone, but the capacity to continue, the journalist's refusal to accept that a stolen camera was the end of the story.

She looked up when Connor passed. Their eyes met. She didn't speak. Her gaze moved across his face with the attention of a person cataloguing details -- the hollows under his eyes, the tension in his jaw, the way his hands hung at his sides with the loose, disconnected quality of limbs that had given up on purposeful motion. She was reading him the way she read a scene before photographing it: assessing the light, the composition, the story the arrangement of elements told without narration. And what she saw, Connor understood, was the thing she had been waiting to see since she first noticed Felix's hand on his shoulder in the common room weeks ago -- the final stage, the approach to the event that would complete the narrative she had been assembling in her laptop's files, the story of a backpacker who walked into a trap and was now standing at its centre, looking out.

Her expression was the expression of a woman who was writing a story and the story was nearly finished and the ending was the part she hadn't written yet because the ending hadn't happened yet but it was coming, it was two days away, and she could feel it the way journalists felt stories approaching completion -- the narrative weight, the gravitational pull of events toward their inevitable conclusion.

Connor looked away. He climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. The Japanese characters watched from under their paint. The building breathed.

In the late afternoon, when the light through the air well had shifted from white to amber and the call to prayer from Masjid Jamek had come and gone, Connor climbed to the rooftop. The plastic chairs were warm. The clothesline held a batik sarong and a pair of socks that belonged to no one he knew. And there, between the shophouse roofs and the tangle of electrical wires and the water tanks and the satellite dishes, the Petronas Towers stood in the distance, their steel surfaces catching the late sun, the skybridge connecting them at the forty-first floor like a clause linking two sentences in an argument about height and ambition and the human compulsion to build things that exceeded human scale.

He had seen the towers every day for six weeks. He had photographed them for Instagram. He had used them as a backdrop for the life he was performing. But he had never looked at them the way he looked at them now, which was the way a person looked at something they might not see again -- with an attention that was not aesthetic but archival, the eyes storing what the camera no longer mattered enough to capture. The towers were beautiful. The towers were indifferent. The towers would be there tomorrow and the day after and the year after and the decade after, and Connor would not be here for any of it, and the not-being-here was so close now that he could feel its texture, could feel the specific quality of a future in which this rooftop and these towers and this amber light existed without him in it.

He sat in the plastic chair until the sun dropped behind the buildings to the west and the towers' surfaces went from gold to grey to the beginning of their nightly illumination, and the heat did not relent but changed character, became heavier, wetter, the prelude to the thunderstorm that would arrive at nine and make the hostel's air well roar with rain.

He went downstairs. He lay in Bed 7. He put the pillow over the burner phone and the towel over the pillow and closed his eyes and did not sleep.

Two days.

The clock was ticking. The fan was turning. The name was on the bed frame. And somewhere in a private room on the third floor, Felix Decker was preparing a suitcase with 450 grams of methamphetamine in its lining, and the suitcase was the last thing Connor Briggs would carry, and the carrying would take less than a day, and the day would be the last day of the life he knew, and the life he knew was already ending, had been ending since the first envelope, had been ending since the common room and the beer and the German accent and the smile, and the ending was coming, and the ending was not an ending but a door, and the door opened onto a room, and the room was small and grey and had bars on the front and a fluorescent light that never turned off, and the room was waiting.

Two days.

The ceiling fan turned.

*Tick, tick, tick.*
# Chapter 27: The Card

On Day 44, at eleven PM, Connor took Sergeant Ahmad's business card out of his wallet and placed it on the thin mattress of Bed 7 and looked at it.

The card was creased now -- soft with pocket-wear, the corners rounded, the ink slightly faded where his thumb had rubbed the phone number during the hours of insomnia that had become his nightly companion. SERGEANT AHMAD BIN ISMAIL. NARCOTICS DIVISION -- DANG WANGI. The PDRM crest in blue and gold, the Royal Malaysia Police insignia that Connor had first seen on peaked caps at a checkpoint in Bukit Bintang, a lifetime ago, when he had been clean and the fear had been theoretical and the card had been a curiosity rather than a lifeline.

The dorm was dark. The French backpacker above was asleep -- he'd been replaced by a Finnish man who snored in a different register but with the same metronomic reliability. The air well breathed its nighttime breath. The ceiling fan turned.

Connor picked up the card. He picked up his phone -- the real phone, not the burner. He opened the keypad. He typed the number. The digits appeared on the screen in white: +60 3 2600 ####. He stared at them. The cursor blinked after the last digit, waiting for the instruction to connect, waiting for the thumb that would press the green button and send the signal through the Malaysian telecommunications network to a phone on a desk at Dang Wangi district police headquarters, where a man named Ahmad who had looked at Connor on a Bukit Bintang pavement and said *Malaysia is not a game* would answer and listen and do the thing that police officers did, which was act.

He could press the button. Right now. In this dark dorm, in this moment, the button was available. The call would take thirty seconds to connect. Ahmad's voice would arrive -- calm, professional, the voice of a man who had been waiting for this call the way experienced officers waited for calls that confirmed suspicions. Connor would speak. He would say: *My name is Connor Briggs. I'm Australian. I've been carrying methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur for a German national named Felix Decker who operates out of the Lantern Hostel on Petaling Street. I have a work phone with records of every delivery. I can identify the contacts: Mr. Tan, Auntie Lim, Danny, Ah Keat. The drugs are assembled at Wei's phone repair shop, two doors from the hostel. I want to cooperate.*

He could say that. The words were formed, ready, assembled in the correct order. The words would transform him from a suspect into an informant, from a defendant into a witness, from a dead man into a living one. The words were the exit. The words were the door.

His thumb hovered over the green button.

The reasons not to press it arrived in a column, each one presented with the clinical precision of a final argument:

*One: Felix has CCTV footage of every delivery. If Connor calls the police, Felix releases the footage before the police can act. The footage shows Connor carrying packages. The footage is sufficient for a trafficking charge. The footage is Connor's death sentence, released on his own initiative.*

*Two: Felix has contacts within the police. Connor didn't know this explicitly, but the operational sophistication -- the burner phones, the route management, the protocol for silencing caught mules -- implied infrastructure that extended beyond a German backpacker and a phone repair shop. If Ahmad was clean, his colleagues might not be. If Connor called and the wrong person answered, the call would reach Felix before it reached a courtroom.*

*Three: Priya. Felix had threatened her -- subtly, professionally, the way Felix threatened everything. If Connor went to the police, Priya's name would surface. Her visa status, her medical career, her family in London -- all of it exposed to the machine that Felix controlled. Connor had dragged her close enough to the fire. He could not drag her closer.*

*Four: His parents. A trafficking charge -- even as a cooperating witness -- would become public record. David and Karen Briggs of Hawthorn, Melbourne, would receive a phone call informing them that their son was involved in drug trafficking in Southeast Asia. The phone call would arrive on a Tuesday afternoon or a Sunday morning and it would destroy them -- not the clinical destruction of legal proceedings but the personal destruction of knowing that their son, the boy they'd driven to soccer and helped with homework and sent $2,000 a month, was a drug mule. The word *mule* would be in the newspapers. Megan would read it. The neighbours would read it. The golf club would read it.*

The reasons were compelling. The reasons were also, Connor understood with a clarity that had arrived too late, the product of the machine -- not the old machine, the one that had produced denial, but a new machine, one that produced paralysis, one that took the raw material of fear and manufactured inaction. The new machine was more sophisticated than the old one. The old machine said *everything is fine*. The new machine said *everything is terrible and nothing can be done*.

Both machines served the same purpose: keeping Connor still.

He looked at the phone. The number was on the screen. The green button waited. His thumb was one centimetre from the surface of the glass.

He pressed the button.

The phone connected. One ring. Two rings. Three rings. Connor's heart was in his throat, the pulse audible in his ears, the blood moving with the desperate speed of a body preparing for something enormous.

Four rings. Five rings. A click. Voicemail.

"You have reached the desk of Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi. I am unable to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone, or call the general line at--"

Connor ended the call.

He stared at the phone. The call log showed the number, the duration -- nineteen seconds -- the time. He hadn't left a message. He hadn't spoken. The call had connected to a machine, and the machine had spoken to him in Ahmad's recorded voice, and the voice had asked him to leave a message, and he had not left a message because leaving a message required speaking and speaking required courage and courage was the one resource he had exhausted completely.

He could call back. He could call the general line. He could call again in five minutes, or ten, or in the morning when Ahmad would be at his desk.

He put the phone down.

He picked up the business card. He held it between his fingers. The cardstock was soft now, worn, the paper fibres separating at the edges. The card had been in his wallet for two weeks. It had been carried through deliveries and drops and the daily mechanics of a life that was no longer a life but a countdown, and the card had waited, patient as stone, for the moment when Connor would use it.

The moment had come and gone. Nineteen seconds. Five rings. A voicemail. A silence.

Connor put the card back in his wallet. He put the wallet under his pillow, beside the blue towel. He lay in the dark and felt the full weight of what he had just done -- not the call, which was nothing, but the not-speaking, which was everything. The not-speaking was the final choice. The not-speaking was the door closing, the last door, the one that opened onto a corridor that had no other exits.

---

He didn't sleep. At three AM he got up and went to the air well.

The courtyard was dark, the mosaic tiles cool under his bare feet, the sky above a rectangle of orange-lit cloud. No stars. No moon. Just the city's ambient glow reflected off the atmosphere, the permanent false dawn of eight million lives generating light.

He sat on the tile bench. The bench was cold. The air was warm. The combination -- cold stone, warm air -- was the specific thermal experience of a tropical night in a building with stone floors, and it was a sensation Connor knew he would remember, in the way that condemned men remembered the small details of their last days, the texture of the wall, the temperature of the water, the sound of the guard's keys.

The air well was the architectural heart of the Lantern Hostel -- a vertical shaft carved through the building's centre, open to the sky, the walls rising three stories on each side and lined with the original Portuguese-colonial mosaic tiles that Uncle Razak claimed were older than Malaysian independence. The tiles were blue and white, geometric, the pattern repeating in a tessellation that had survived ninety-seven years of monsoons and renovations and the accumulated moisture of ten thousand tropical nights. In daylight the tiles were beautiful. At three AM they were grey, the colour leached by darkness, the pattern visible only in outline, like a blueprint for something that had once been vivid and was now reduced to structure. The air was heavy with a dampness that never fully lifted -- the tiles sweating, the residual moisture of the afternoon rain still clinging to the grout lines, the smell of wet stone mixing with the faint organic sweetness of the potted frangipani that Mama Siti kept in clay pots along the eastern wall. The rectangle of sky above was featureless -- no stars, no definition, just the amber diffusion of Kuala Lumpur's eight million lives burning electricity into the clouds. From the upper floors came the small sounds of a sleeping building: the creak of bed frames, the murmur of someone talking in a dream, the rhythmic click of a ceiling fan with a loose bearing. And from the third floor -- Felix's floor -- a sound that might have been a footstep, a single, deliberate footstep on the wooden boards above, and Connor froze, his body locking in the chemical rigidity of a man who had been surveilled for long enough that every ambient sound was a potential watcher, every creak a confirmation that the building itself was complicit. He sat motionless for thirty seconds, a minute, listening, his breath shallow, his hands flat on the cold tile, and the sound did not repeat, and the not-repeating was worse than the repeating would have been, because a sound that came once and stopped was a sound that knew it had been heard.

He thought about Lena.

The name on the bed frame. The girl from Sweden, twenty-two, who had slept in Bed 7 and carried packages for Felix and been arrested at a bus station and was now in Kajang Prison awaiting a trial that would end with the word *mandatory* and the word *death*. Lena, who had carved her name into the wood with a fingernail or a coin, the only mark she could leave in a world that was about to erase her.

Connor had been sleeping on her name for six weeks. He had placed his hand on her letters every morning as he climbed out of bed and every night as he climbed in. The letters had been under his palm -- L-E-N-A -- and he had never felt them, never looked, never turned the raw sensation of carved wood into the information it contained. The information was: *I was here. I did what you're doing. This is what happened.*

Connor had found the letters on Day 30, when the burner phone had slipped between the mattress and the frame and his hand had followed it down and his fingers had passed over the carved wood and stopped. He had pulled the mattress aside and looked. L-E-N-A. The letters were shallow, scratched rather than carved, the work of a fingernail or the edge of a coin pressed into softwood with the desperate, patient insistence of someone who needed to leave evidence that they had existed in this bed, in this room, in this building, before the system that was coming for them erased every other trace. The letters were testimony. The letters said: *I lay where you lie. I carried what you carry. I trusted the man you trust. And this is the only thing that remains of me -- four scratches in a bed frame in a hostel that has already given my bed to someone else.* Connor had replaced the mattress. He had not spoken about the letters. He had not told Priya, or Razak, or anyone, because speaking about the letters would require acknowledging what they meant, and what they meant was that Bed 7 was not a bed but a station, a waypoint in a process that had a beginning and an end, and the end was not a departure gate.

He thought about what he would carve into the wood. If he had time. If he had a coin. If the impulse to leave a mark overcame the paralysis that had replaced every other impulse in his body. He would carve: CONNOR. Six letters. Two more than LENA. Two names, two mules, two stories that were the same story told in different accents.

He sat in the air well until four. Then he went back to Bed 7. He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. The towel was smooth and cool, the microfiber catching the faint light from the air well, the fabric that would be with him at the end.

---

Day 45. One day to Priya's flight. One day to the final job.

The morning was bright and hot and terrible in its normalcy. The call to prayer came at 5:32. The motorcycle engines started on Petaling Street. Mama Siti's wok hit flame. The ceiling fans turned in every room. The hostel performed its morning routine with the mechanical reliability of a building that had been waking up every morning for ninety-seven years and would continue waking up long after everyone currently inside it was gone.

Connor ate breakfast. The nasi lemak was perfect. The sambal was hot. The coffee was bad. He ate and drank and tasted nothing and felt nothing and sat at the kitchen counter like a man made of the same material as the counter -- wood and surface and the accumulated marks of years.

Priya came down at nine. She was wearing a white dress -- simple, cotton, the kind of dress you wore when you wanted to feel light. Her hair was braided. Her glasses were clean. The jade bracelet was on her wrist.

She looked at Connor and saw him and what she saw was not the man she'd met at a hawker stall five weeks ago -- the brash, funny, infuriating Australian who had teased her about her guidebook and bought her a bracelet and kissed her under stars in an air well. What she saw was a man who had been taken apart, piece by piece, component by component, disassembled by a professional who knew which pieces to remove first and which to leave until last, and the last piece -- the piece that was still attached, the piece that allowed the man to move and eat and sit at a counter -- was the piece that would be removed tomorrow, on a bus, at a checkpoint, when a dog smelled the truth through the lining of a suitcase.

"Today," she said. "You and me. The whole day. Whatever you want."

He looked at her. "Whatever I want?"

"Whatever you want."

He wanted to go home. He wanted to be in his mother's kitchen in Hawthorn, eating Vegemite toast, listening to his father talk about the property market. He wanted to be twenty-two again, at the departure gate at Tullamarine, with his father's hand on his shoulder, hearing the words *the rules don't care who you are* and this time, this time, listening.

"Let's go to the Bird Park," he said.

They went to the KL Bird Park -- Taman Burung, in the Lake Gardens, the world's largest free-flight walk-in aviary. The park was a green dome stretched over a valley, the netting invisible from inside, the illusion complete: you were not in a park but in a forest, and the birds were not captive but free, and the freedom was real because it was bounded, and the bounds were invisible, and invisibility was the same as absence. Connor looked up and caught it -- the faintest shimmer of mesh against the sky, the netting that enclosed everything, the barrier that the birds could not see and therefore did not resist. The birds lived inside a boundary they didn't know existed. The birds flew and ate and called and mated and believed the sky was theirs, and the sky was theirs, except for the part above the netting, which was the real sky, and the real sky was a place the birds would never reach. Connor understood this. Connor understood this with the specific, nauseating clarity of a man who had recently discovered his own netting -- the CCTV footage, the burner phone records, the fingerprints on packages -- the invisible mesh that Felix had strung around him so carefully that Connor had not felt it until he tried to fly.

Hornbills sat in trees above them, their massive beaks absurd and beautiful, the casques like helmets designed by someone who believed birds should go to war. One landed on a branch three metres from the path -- a rhinoceros hornbill, enormous, its beak curving like a scimitar painted in shades of orange and cream, its eyes dark and ancient and completely indifferent to the two humans staring up at it. Priya gasped. The sound was involuntary, joyful, the sound of a woman encountering a living thing that was more beautiful than she had expected, and Connor looked at her face and saw the joy and the joy destroyed him, not because it was false but because it was real, because Priya could still feel joy, could still look at a bird and feel wonder, and Connor could not, and the distance between her wonder and his numbness was the distance between a person who was going to survive and a person who was not. He wanted to feel what she felt. He wanted to look at the hornbill and see the hornbill and not the metaphor, not the cage, not the netting. He wanted to be the man she thought he was -- the brash, funny Australian who teased her about guidebooks and bought her jade bracelets and kissed her under stars. That man was gone. That man had been replaced by a machine that produced paralysis, and the machine was looking at a hornbill and calculating escape routes. Flamingos stood in shallow water, one-legged, pink, performing the ancient art of standing still and looking magnificent. Parakeets swarmed in clouds of green and yellow, their calls filling the canopy with a noise that was not language but was communication, and the communication said: *we are here, we are alive, we are loud, and the loudness is the living*.

Connor and Priya walked through the park. They held hands. They didn't talk about tomorrow. They talked about the birds -- their names, their habits, the Malay words that Priya had learned from her guidebook. *Burung enggang* for hornbill. *Flamingo* for flamingo, because some things were universal. *Burung kakak tua* for cockatoo, which Priya said meant "old sister bird," and Connor laughed, and the laugh was real, and the realness of it was the most painful thing he'd felt all week, because laughter required the momentary belief that things were okay, and things were not okay, and the gap between the laughter and the truth was the gap that would swallow him.

They ate lunch at a hawker stall outside the park. Nasi goreng -- fried rice with an egg on top, the yolk running yellow into the rice when you broke it. They ate with forks and drank teh tarik and sat in plastic chairs and watched the park entrance where families were arriving with children, the children's excitement creating a sound that was the opposite of the sound in Connor's head.

"Tell me about London," Connor said.

Priya told him. She told him about King's College, about the neurology department, about the coffee shop on Strand where she studied. She told him about her flat in Bermondsey, the one with the damp problem and the view of the Shard. She told him about her parents in Ealing, her father the cardiologist who worked impossible hours, her mother who ran her GP practice in Wembley and made the best dhal in West London. She told him about the rain, which was different from KL rain -- not a vertical ocean but a persistent mist, the kind that got into your clothes and your bones and your soul and made everything grey and damp and quintessentially English.

"It sounds terrible," Connor said, smiling.

"It is terrible. It's the most terrible, wonderful, frustrating, beautiful city in the world. And I want to take you there."

"I'd like that."

The sentence was conditional -- *I'd like that* rather than *I'll go*. Priya heard the conditional. She heard the tense. She held his hand tighter and the jade bracelet pressed against his wrist and neither of them said the thing that sat between them, the thing that they both knew, which was that London was not where Connor was going, that tomorrow was not a departure but an arrival, and the arrival was at a destination that no flight could reach and no guidebook described.

They went back to the hostel at five. They sat on the rooftop. They watched the sunset -- the sky turning orange, then red, then the deep purple that KL produced on clear evenings, the colour of bruises, the colour of things that had been hit. The Petronas Towers caught the last light and held it and then released it and became silhouettes, dark fingers against the darkening sky.

"I love you," Priya said.

"I love you," Connor said.

The words were true. The words were insufficient. The words were the only currency they had, and the currency was being spent on the last evening of a thing that had never had a chance to become the thing it might have been, and the waste of it -- the beautiful, terrible waste of two people who found each other in a hostel in a country where one of them was about to be destroyed -- was the dark comedy at the heart of the novel that neither of them knew they were living.

They went to bed. Separate dorms. At the staircase landing between the second and third floors -- the dim landing where the single bulb cast a yellowed, insufficient light that made everything look like a photograph taken in the wrong decade -- Priya stopped. She turned. She put her hands on his face, both hands, her palms against his jaw, and she kissed him. Not the brief kiss of routine but the long, full, desperate kiss of someone saying goodbye without using the word, the kiss that tried to compress everything -- every moment, every meal, every night market and every mosque and every shared joke -- into a single point of contact between two pairs of lips that were warm and present and about to be separated by something larger than geography. The kiss lasted ten seconds, twenty, the duration expanding beyond the social mechanics of a goodnight kiss into the territory of a statement, a plea, a final argument. Priya's body was saying *come with me*, her hands on his face were saying *come with me*, the pressure of her mouth was the pressure of a woman who knew that if she let go the thing she was holding would fall and not get up. And Connor's body was saying *I'm sorry*, and his hands on her waist were saying *I'm sorry*, and the jade bracelet on her wrist pressed against his neck as she held him and the hard edge of the jade was a small, bright point of pain that he would remember later, in a cell, under fluorescent light, when the memory of this landing and this light and this woman's hands on his face would be the last good thing his mind produced before the last good things stopped.

The kiss ended. Priya went to Dorm 4. Connor went to Dorm 3.

He climbed into Bed 7. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. He placed both phones on the mattress -- the real phone, with his mother's last text, and the burner phone, with Felix's last instruction.

He closed his eyes. Tomorrow, Priya would fly to London. Tomorrow, Felix would give him a suitcase. Tomorrow, both doors would close.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The building breathed. The name waited. The countdown reached zero.
# Chapter 28: Priya Leaves

The suitcase was red.

Not the red of the Deuter backpack Connor had carried to Sentul -- that was a functional red, a hiking red, the red of adventure brands and departure lounges and the curated outdoorsiness of people who wore technical fabrics to brunch. Priya's suitcase was a different red. A deep, warm, almost-burgundy red that she'd bought at a Selfridges sale in her first year at King's College because it was the only suitcase in the store that didn't look like it belonged to a banker or a retired person. The suitcase had been to seven countries. It had a dent on the left corner from a baggage handler in Istanbul and a scratch across the front from a tuk-tuk in Colombo and a sticker on the back that said FRAGILE in three languages, which Priya had stuck there as a joke because she was the least fragile person Connor had ever met.

The suitcase stood in the common room at seven AM on Day 46, and the suitcase was leaving, and the woman who owned the suitcase was leaving, and the leaving was the last act of a story that had started five weeks ago at a hawker stall when a British-Indian medical student had looked at an Australian backpacker over a plate of char kway teow and seen something worth saving.

The saving had failed. The suitcase was proof.

---

Priya came down the staircase at seven fifteen. She was wearing the white dress again -- the cotton one, the light one, the dress she'd worn to the Bird Park. Her hair was braided. Her glasses were clean. The jade bracelet was on her wrist. She carried her daypack over one shoulder and her Lonely Planet Malaysia in her hand, the guidebook that had been her companion and her weapon and her futile shield against the country's capacity to destroy the people she loved.

She saw Connor and she stopped.

He was sitting on the common room sofa. He had been sitting there since five AM, since the call to prayer had reached through the air well and found him already awake, already dressed, already occupying the posture of a man who was waiting for something he didn't want to arrive. He wore his least-dirty clothes -- the board shorts with the frayed hem and the grey T-shirt that Priya had once said made him look almost respectable, which was the most generous thing anyone had ever said about his wardrobe.

"Hi," she said.

"Hi."

The word was insufficient. The word was always insufficient when it was carrying weight it wasn't designed for -- the weight of goodbye, the weight of failure, the weight of two people standing in a hostel common room at seven in the morning with a red suitcase between them and a flight at eleven thirty and a gap between them that was not geographical but moral, not about distance but about the choice that one of them had made and the other could not accept.

Priya set her daypack on the sofa. She sat beside Connor. She did not touch him. The not-touching was deliberate, a restraint, the physical expression of a decision she'd made during the night -- a night she'd spent in Dorm 4, awake, staring at the underside of the bunk above her, running the calculation one final time: the calculation of what she could save and what she could not, the calculation that every person who loved an addict eventually performed, except Connor's addiction wasn't chemical but structural, wasn't substance but system, wasn't a drug but a man named Felix who dispensed compliance the way dealers dispensed product.

"Your flight's at eleven thirty," Connor said.

"Eleven thirty."

"You should leave by nine. Traffic to KLIA2 can be--"

"Connor."

He stopped. The name -- his name, in her voice, with the particular emphasis she gave to the second syllable, the stress that turned the name from an Australian monosyllable into something that carried the melodic weight of her South London accent -- the name stopped him the way it always stopped him, because the name in her voice was the sound of being known, and being known was the thing he needed most and feared most and had spent five weeks running from because being known meant being seen and being seen meant being seen clearly and clarity was fatal.

"I'm not going to ask you again," Priya said.

"I know."

"I've asked you fourteen times. Different words, different moments, different arguments. Fourteen times I've said *come with me* or *stop* or *call Ahmad* or *leave tonight*. Fourteen times."

"I know."

"You always say *I know*. That's the worst part. You know. You've always known. Knowing has never been the problem."

The common room was quiet. The ceiling fans turned. Through the kitchen doorway, Mama Siti was visible at her station, the morning's nasi lemak already underway, the coconut rice steaming, the sambal simmering. Mama Siti glanced toward the common room, toward Priya and Connor on the sofa, and her expression was the expression of a woman who had seen this before -- not the specific configuration but the general shape, the geometry of departure, the angle at which one person leaned toward another person who was about to become a former person, a used-to-be person, a person who existed only in photographs and the subjunctive tense.

"There's something I need to tell you," Priya said. "And I need you to listen. Actually listen. Not the thing you do where your face listens and your mind is somewhere else."

"I'm listening."

She took a breath. The breath was visible -- her chest rising under the white cotton, the expansion of a body preparing to deliver something heavy, the physical mechanics of courage.

"I wrote a letter. Last night. To Sergeant Ahmad. Dang Wangi District Police, Narcotics Division. I wrote everything I know. Your name. Felix's name. Wei's shop. The schedule. The charger boxes. The Sentul warehouse. The deliveries. The amounts you've carried. Everything."

Connor's body went cold. Not the cold of the air conditioning -- the hostel didn't have air conditioning -- but the internal cold of adrenaline, the chemical winter that the body produced when threat arrived not as a sound or a sight but as information, as words, as the quiet voice of a woman he loved telling him she had committed the act that would end his life.

"You didn't," he said.

"I wrote it. I haven't sent it. The letter is in my bag. I'm going to send it from London."

"Priya--"

"From London. Where I'll be safe. Where Felix can't reach me. Where I can send the letter to Ahmad and to the Australian Embassy and to the editor of The Star newspaper and to every contact I have who might be able to do something, and I'll be in a country where the worst that happens is deportation, not execution."

She said the words with the clinical precision of a plan that had been constructed in the dark, hour by hour, during a sleepless night in Dorm 4. The plan was clear. The plan was logical. The plan was the plan of a woman who had tried love and tried argument and tried tears and tried silence and had found all of them insufficient and had arrived, finally, at the last available instrument: action without permission.

"If you send that letter, I'm dead," Connor said.

"If I don't send that letter, you're dead."

"Felix has the footage. The CCTV. My fingerprints. If the police come, the footage surfaces, and I'm--"

"You're arrested. Yes. You're charged. Yes. You face trial. Yes. And the trial is the only place where you might survive, Connor. The trial is where a lawyer can argue that you were coerced, that you were recruited, that you were a mule and not a dealer. The trial is where Ahmad's evidence -- Felix, Wei, the network -- might shift the charge from trafficking to possession. The trial is where fifty grams becomes a question rather than an answer."

She had researched this. The precision of her language -- the legal vocabulary, the distinction between trafficking and possession, the reference to Section 39B's presumption clause -- was not improvised. She had spent hours on her laptop in Dorm 4, searching Malaysian legal databases, reading human rights reports, studying the cases of foreigners arrested for drug trafficking who had cooperated with authorities and received reduced sentences. She had found cases where mules who testified against networks had been charged with possession rather than trafficking. She had found the numbers: possession carried a maximum of life imprisonment. Trafficking carried a minimum of death.

The gap between life and death was the gap between cooperation and silence. The gap was the letter in her bag.

"I need time," Connor said.

"You've had time. You've had forty-six days. Time isn't what you need. Time is what Felix needs. Every day you wait is a day Felix uses to prepare the final job. Every day you wait is a day closer to the suitcase and the bus and the checkpoint that you know -- you *know*, Connor -- is coming."

"The job is today. Felix said--"

"I know what Felix said. That's why I'm telling you now. Before the job. Before the suitcase. Before you get on a bus with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in the lining and drive through a country that will execute you for carrying it."

She knew the weight. She knew the amount. The specificity of the number -- four hundred and fifty grams -- was not a guess. Priya had calculated it from what Connor had told her, from the escalation pattern, from the amounts he'd described carrying in packages and backpacks, from the logic of a final job that was bigger than all the others. She had done the math. The math said death.

Connor looked at the red suitcase. The suitcase that was going to London. The suitcase that contained clothes and books and toiletries and a letter that held his life in its paragraphs, a letter that could save him or destroy him depending on variables he could not control -- the honesty of Ahmad, the corruption of the system, the willingness of a Malaysian court to distinguish between a mule and a dealer.

"Send the letter," he said.

The words came from somewhere he didn't recognize -- somewhere beneath the machine, beneath the fear, beneath the five weeks of accumulated denial and rationalisation that had converted him from a tourist into a defendant. The words came from the part of Connor Briggs that still existed, the part that his mother would recognize, the part that had said *okay* in the common room on Day 39 before the burner phone buzzed and Felix's summons pulled him upstairs.

Priya's eyes filled. Not dramatically -- not the cinematic weeping of a farewell scene, not the tears that actors produced on cue. This was different. This was the slow, quiet overflow of a woman who had been holding her breath for five weeks and had just been given, in two words, the permission to exhale.

"You mean it," she said.

"Send the letter. From London. To Ahmad, to the embassy, to everyone. And I'll--"

He stopped. The sentence had a second half and the second half required a commitment and the commitment required a decision about what he would do between now and the letter's arrival, between this morning and the afternoon when Priya would land at Heathrow and open her laptop and press send.

"And you'll what?" Priya said.

"I'll wait. I won't do the job. I'll tell Felix I'm sick, or I've left, or-- I'll find a reason. I'll stall. Until Ahmad comes."

"Connor, if you're here when the letter arrives, Felix will know. Felix will know because the police will come and Felix has eyes everywhere and the interval between the letter arriving and the police acting is the interval in which Felix decides what to do with you."

"Where else would I go?"

"The Australian Embassy. Go today. Walk in. Tell them everything. They can't protect you from Malaysian law but they can ensure you're in custody when the letter arrives, not at the hostel where Felix--"

"The embassy will call the police. The police will arrest me. I'll be in a cell within hours."

"You'll be in a cell where Sergeant Ahmad knows your name and your story and your willingness to cooperate. Not a cell where Felix's contacts can reach you. There's a difference."

The difference was the letter. The difference was whether Connor entered the system as a cooperating witness or as a caught mule. The difference was the distinction between walking into a police station and being dragged out of a bus. The difference was survival.

Connor looked at Priya. She looked at him. The common room was filling with morning light -- the amber glow of the red lanterns replaced by the blue-white of tropical dawn, the light that came through the air well and hit the mosaic tiles and scattered in patterns that moved as the sun moved, the slow celestial clock that measured something larger than human choice.

"Okay," he said. Again. The word he'd said on Day 39 and failed to honour. The word that was simultaneously the easiest and hardest word in the English language -- easy to pronounce, hard to mean.

Priya took his hand. The jade bracelet clinked against the bones of his wrist. Her skin was warm. Her grip was strong -- the grip of a woman who had been holding on for five weeks and was about to let go and the letting go required the belief that the holding had accomplished something, that the effort had not been wasted, that the man whose hand she held would, this time, do the thing he said he would do.

"I love you," she said.

"I love you."

"Then survive. That's all I'm asking. Survive this."

Mama Siti appeared in the kitchen doorway. She carried two plates of nasi lemak -- the banana leaf wrapping, the coconut rice, the sambal, the ikan bilis, the slice of hard-boiled egg and the slice of cucumber, the complete breakfast of a country that understood that mornings required sustenance and that sustenance was not just calories but ceremony.

She placed the plates on the counter without speaking. Then she looked at Priya. She looked at the red suitcase. She looked at Connor.

"Makan dulu," she said. *Eat first.*

They ate. The nasi lemak was perfect. The sambal burned. The rice was fragrant with coconut and pandan. They ate in the silence of two people performing a normal act on an abnormal morning, the normalcy of the food a temporary shelter from the conversation that had preceded it and the departure that would follow.

Mama Siti watched from the kitchen. Her face was still. Her eyes moved between Priya and Connor with the slow deliberation of a woman reading a text in a language she'd learned decades ago, the language of farewell, the language that the hostel had taught her through ninety-seven years of arrivals and departures, the language that said: *this one is leaving and the other one is staying and the staying is the dangerous part*.

She spoke once, to Priya, as Priya carried her empty plate to the wash area.

"Dia masih ada masa," she said. *He still has time.*

Priya looked at Mama Siti. Mama Siti's expression was unchanged -- the worn geography of her face, the deep lines around her eyes, the mouth that dispensed proverbs and nasi lemak with equal precision. But her eyes held something that her face did not express. Not hope exactly. Something harder. Something closer to the word for the belief that a story might end differently than you expected it to, the belief that the building might release one of its guests instead of keeping them.

"Terima kasih," Priya said. *Thank you.*

Mama Siti nodded. She turned back to her stove. The wok hissed. The morning continued.

---

At eight forty-five, Mei Ling called a Grab to KLIA2.

The car arrived at eight fifty-three -- a silver Proton Saga, the driver a Malay man in his fifties who had the patient, incurious expression of a man who drove people to airports every morning and had long ago stopped wondering where they were going or why they looked the way they looked. He loaded Priya's suitcase into the boot. The red suitcase disappeared into the car's interior, and with it, the letter.

Connor stood on the pavement outside the Lantern Hostel. Petaling Street was awakening -- the vendors setting up their stalls, the morning market taking shape in its daily configuration of canvas and trestle and merchandise. The street smelled of fried dough and diesel and the chemical sweetness of the durian stall three doors down that was already unpacking its thorned cargo for the day's trade.

Priya stood in front of him. They were on the pavement where he had arrived forty-six days ago, dragging his own bag from the KTM station, looking up at the red lanterns and the pre-war facade and thinking *this'll do for a week*. The pavement where he had entered this story. The pavement where Priya was exiting it.

"The embassy," she said. "Today. Promise me."

"I promise."

"Not like last time. Not *five minutes* and then the rooftop. Today. Now. After I leave, you walk to the embassy and you--"

"I promise, Priya."

She searched his face. She searched it the way she searched diagnostic scans -- methodically, looking for the signs that indicated truth or its absence, the microexpressions that the face produced when the mouth and the mind were not in agreement. She was a medical student. She knew how to read bodies. She had been reading Connor's body for five weeks, and the reading had been consistent: the body said one thing and the person said another, and the gap between the body's truth and the person's words was the gap that Felix exploited, that the machine maintained, that the denial required.

This morning, the gap was smaller. Not closed -- the gap might never close, might be a permanent feature of Connor Briggs's architecture, the structural flaw in the building that could not be repaired but only reinforced. But the gap was smaller. The words and the body were closer to alignment than they had been at any point since Day 6, since the first envelope, since the beginning of the long walk into the forest.

"I believe you," she said.

She believed him the way a doctor believed a patient who said they'd take their medication. Not with certainty. Not with the trust that comes from evidence. But with the qualified, hopeful, professionally calibrated belief of a person who had done everything in her power and was now transferring the outcome to the patient, the way all caregivers eventually transferred the outcome, the way all people who loved people eventually stepped back and let the loved one choose.

She kissed him. The kiss was long. The kiss was the kind of kiss that people gave at airports and train stations and hospital beds and any place where departure was real and the return was uncertain. The kiss compressed everything -- every hawker stall, every night market, every rooftop sunset, every argument, every morning, every conversation about the law she'd printed and the card he hadn't used and the life they might have had if the variables had been different, if the hostel had been different, if the man in the common room had been a photographer instead of a handler.

The kiss ended.

Priya got into the Grab. The door closed. The window was down and she looked at Connor through the opening and her eyes were wet and her face was the face of a woman who was leaving a burning building because staying would kill her too and the leaving was not abandonment but survival and survival was the thing she had asked Connor to choose and the asking was the last thing she could do.

"Embassy," she said. One word. The word was a command and a prayer and a diagnosis all at once.

The car pulled away. The Proton Saga joined the morning traffic on Petaling Street, threading between the market stalls and the delivery vans and the motorcycles, the red suitcase in the boot growing smaller as the car moved away, and Priya's face in the window growing smaller, and the hand she raised growing smaller, and then the car turned onto Jalan Sultan and was gone.

Connor stood on the pavement. The vendors worked around him. A man carrying a box of counterfeit handbags brushed past. A motorcycle horn blared. The durian stall's fragrance intensified as the morning heat began its work.

He was alone.

Not alone the way he'd been alone in the first week, when aloneness was a choice and a pose, the solitary traveler performing his solitude for an imagined audience. This aloneness was different. This was the aloneness of a man who had been stripped of everyone who might save him -- Priya gone to London, Jake gone to Langkawi, Tomoko's camera stolen, Ahmad's phone ringing to voicemail, his parents in a kitchen in Hawthorn that might as well have been on a different planet. This aloneness was structural. This aloneness was the building's gift, the hostel's contribution to the project of isolation that Felix had been engineering since the first evening in the common room.

He stood on the pavement for three minutes. Three minutes in which the morning moved around him and the city continued and the choice was still available -- the embassy was seven kilometres away, a thirty-minute Grab ride, a walk through security, a conversation with a consular official who would listen and act and connect him to Ahmad and to the system that might, if Priya's research was correct, distinguish between a mule and a dealer, between fifty grams and four hundred and fifty grams, between death and life.

The embassy was available. The embassy was open. The embassy was waiting.

Connor turned and walked back into the Lantern Hostel.

---

He told himself he was going to get his passport. The embassy would need his passport. He was going upstairs to get his passport from the locker under Bed 7 and then he was going to the embassy. That was the plan. That was what he was doing.

He climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. The second-floor landing was empty. The Japanese characters watched from under their paint. Dorm 3's door was ajar.

He pushed it open. The dorm was empty -- the transient population of backpackers who had occupied the other beds were out, exploring, living the lives that travellers lived, the lives that Connor had lived for twelve countries and seven months before the thirteenth country and the sixth week changed the category of his existence from *living* to *surviving*.

Bed 7. His bed. The thin mattress. The vinyl surface. The blue towel on the pillow. The wooden frame with LENA carved into the underside of the rail -- the name he'd been sleeping on for forty-six days, the name of the woman who had done what he was doing and ended where he was going.

He opened the locker. His passport was there -- the navy blue Australian passport with the coat of arms on the front, the kangaroo and the emu facing each other across the shield, the animals that couldn't walk backwards, the national symbol that was also, he realised with a clarity that felt like being hit, a description of his situation. Connor Briggs could not walk backwards. Connor Briggs could only go forward, and forward was the suitcase and the bus and the checkpoint.

He held the passport. He could leave now. Walk downstairs, out the door, into a Grab, to the embassy. The passport was in his hand. The embassy was waiting. Priya was in the air, or in a departure lounge, or at a gate, and the letter was in her bag, and the letter was his lifeline, and the lifeline required his cooperation, and his cooperation required his legs to carry him down the staircase and out the door and away from the hostel, away from Felix, away from the machine.

His burner phone buzzed.

The vibration came through the pocket of his board shorts, through the fabric, into his thigh, into the nerve endings that had been conditioned -- over five weeks, over fourteen deliveries, over the Pavlovian training of instruction followed by compliance followed by payment -- to respond to the vibration with attention. The phone was a leash. The phone had always been a leash. The leash vibrated and the dog turned.

He took the phone out.

*Details for today. Come to my room. 10 AM.*

The message was from the number. The number that was Felix. The number that was the network. The number that was the system that had recruited him and used him and was now, in the final act, consuming him.

Ten AM. Seventy minutes from now.

Connor put the passport back in the locker. He sat on Bed 7. He held the burner phone in one hand and the real phone in the other -- the two phones, the two identities, the two lives that had been running in parallel since Day 15 and were about to converge.

He could still go to the embassy. Ten AM was seventy minutes away. The embassy was thirty minutes by Grab. He could be there and back. He could be there and not come back. He could be there, and the *there* would become a different kind of *here*, a *here* that included a consular official and a phone call to Ahmad and the beginning of a process that was terrifying but survivable.

He sat on the bed. He held the phones. The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

At nine fifty-eight, he stood up. He put the burner phone in his left pocket. He put the real phone in his right pocket. He put his passport back in the locker. He locked the locker. He left the dorm.

He climbed the staircase. Not down, toward the door, toward the Grab, toward the embassy. Up. Toward the third floor. Toward Felix's room. Toward the suitcase.

The third step squeaked. The building noted his direction. The building had been noting his direction since Day 1, since the first ascent with a backpack and a confidence that had been eroded, delivery by delivery, into the thing that replaced confidence when confidence was gone, which was momentum -- the pure, directionless, physical fact of a body in motion that continued in motion because stopping required a force and there was no force left, no Priya in the common room, no Jake on the rooftop, no Ahmad on the phone, no force except the gravity of what Felix had built, the gravity that pulled Connor upward, toward the third floor, toward the room where a suitcase waited with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in its lining and a ticket to Penang in its pocket.

He reached the third-floor landing. Felix's door was at the end of the corridor. The door was closed. Behind the door, the German waited. Behind the door, the suitcase waited. Behind the door, the rest of Connor's life waited -- however much of it remained.

He knocked.

The door opened.

---

The common room was empty when Mei Ling came to clean it at eleven. She wiped the counter. She straightened the magazines. She checked the TV remote batteries. She did the things that receptionists did in hostels that had been functioning for ninety-seven years, the routine maintenance of a building that required constant attention because constant attention was what kept entropy at bay.

She paused at the sofa where Connor and Priya had sat. The cushions were still depressed -- the two depressions, side by side, the ghosts of two bodies that had occupied the space an hour ago and left behind only the physics of their weight. She straightened the cushions. The depressions disappeared. The sofa returned to its neutral state, ready for the next bodies, the next conversations, the next goodbyes.

On the reception desk, Priya's checkout form was in the completed pile. Room 4D. Priya Sharma. British. Checked out 09:00, 46th day of stay. Next destination: London Heathrow. No forwarding address. No review left on the guestbook.

Mei Ling filed the form. She opened the booking system on the old desktop computer. Bed 4D was now available. She changed the status to VACANT. By tonight, a new backpacker would be in that bed -- a gap year student, a digital nomad, a solo traveller with a guidebook and a sense of adventure and no idea that the building they were sleeping in was a system, and the system had inputs and outputs, and the outputs were checked-out guests and empty beds and the silence that occupied the space where a person used to be.

She looked toward the staircase. Connor had gone up, not down. She had seen him. She had been at her desk, filing the morning's checkout forms, and she had seen him walk past the reception counter and turn not left, toward the front door, but right, toward the staircase, and climb not to the second floor where his dorm was but to the third floor where Felix's room was, and the climbing was the direction she had been afraid of, the direction that every sign she'd posted and every warning she'd delivered had tried to prevent, the direction that meant the next form she filed for Connor Briggs would not be a checkout form but something else, something that arrived on official letterhead with a police crest and a reference number and the specific, bureaucratic language of a system that processed humans the way conveyor belts processed packages.

She closed the booking system. She picked up the phone. She dialled a number -- not the police, not the embassy, but the number of a man she had known for twenty years, a man who owned the building, a man who had hung a map of deaths on his office wall and watched the pins accumulate.

"Uncle Razak," she said. "Connor went upstairs. To Felix's room. The girl has left."

A pause on the line. The pause of a man receiving information he expected but hoped would not arrive.

"The girl sent a letter," Mei Ling said. "I heard her talking about it. A letter to the police. From London."

Another pause. Longer.

"How long?" Razak asked.

"She said she'd send it when she landed. Her flight is at eleven thirty. She lands in London at--" Mei Ling calculated -- "six AM tomorrow, London time. One PM our time."

"So we have until tomorrow afternoon."

"We have until tomorrow afternoon."

The line was quiet. The hostel was quiet. Somewhere on the third floor, a door opened and closed and the sound travelled through the building's bones -- through the plaster and the timber and the ninety-seven-year-old structure that had been absorbing sounds since the British colonial era -- and the sound reached Mei Ling's ears and she registered it the way she registered every sound in the building, which was with the total, involuntary attention of a woman who lived inside a machine and could not stop listening.

"I'll talk to him," Razak said.

"You've talked to him."

"I'll talk to Felix."

The name -- *Felix* -- sat in the telephone line between them, heavy, electric, the name of the man who had broken the hostel's unwritten rule, the man who had used the building as a base of operations, the man who had taken Uncle Razak's tolerance -- the tolerance that allowed certain activities as long as they remained invisible, as long as the guests remained safe, as long as the building's name remained clean -- and exceeded it, pushed past it, turned the tolerance into complicity and the complicity into guilt.

"Be careful," Mei Ling said.

She hung up. She straightened the reception desk. She aligned the pens. She checked the guest register. She did the things that receptionists did, and the doing was a form of control, and the control was the only thing she had in a building that was accelerating toward something she could feel but not stop, something that moved through the corridors and the staircases and the air well with the silent, inevitable momentum of water finding its level.

The ceiling fan turned in the common room. The red lanterns glowed. The building breathed.

Priya's plane was on the tarmac at KLIA2, loading passengers, preparing for the eleven-hour flight to Heathrow. In the cabin, in seat 34A, a woman with a jade bracelet and a red suitcase and a letter in her bag was looking out the window at the Malaysian landscape -- the palm oil plantations and the construction cranes and the haze that hung over everything like a gauze, like a filter, like the thing that made distance beautiful and proximity unbearable.

She was thinking about Connor. She was thinking about whether *okay* meant *okay* this time. She was thinking about the letter in her bag and the hours between now and London and the things that could happen in those hours in a hostel on Petaling Street where a man she loved was climbing a staircase toward a door behind which his life was being decided by someone who had never cared whether he lived or died.

The plane began to taxi. The engines rose in pitch. The runway appeared through the window, long and grey and straight, the kind of line that existed in only two places: airports and corridors that had no turns.

The plane lifted.

Priya was gone.

---

At eleven thirty-two, as the AirAsia flight to London climbed through seven thousand feet and the Strait of Malacca appeared below as a sheet of hammered silver, Connor Briggs was sitting in Felix Decker's room on the third floor of the Lantern Hostel, looking at a suitcase.

The suitcase was black. Mid-size. Hard-shell. The brand was a Malaysian brand -- a name Connor didn't recognise, the kind of suitcase you bought at a market stall for RM150, the kind that looked like every other suitcase in every other bus luggage compartment in every other transport hub in Southeast Asia. The suitcase was anonymous. The suitcase was designed to be anonymous. The anonymity was the point.

Felix had placed it on the bed -- his bed, the single bed in the private room, the room that cost RM120 per night and had its own bathroom and a window that overlooked the alley and a door with a lock that actually worked. The suitcase lay on the bedspread like a patient on an operating table, its surface catching the overhead light, the black shell reflecting the fluorescent tube in a long, distorted streak.

"Tomorrow," Felix said. "Eight AM bus from TBS -- Terminal Bersepadu Selatan. KL to Penang. Five-hour journey. The bus stops once, at Tapah, for fifteen minutes. The suitcase goes in the luggage compartment. You sit in the bus. You don't touch the suitcase until Penang."

Connor looked at the suitcase. The suitcase looked back. Not literally -- suitcases did not have eyes, did not have intentions, did not participate in the moral calculations of the humans who carried them. But the suitcase occupied the room with the density of an object that knew what it contained, the way a loaded gun occupied a room differently from an unloaded one, the weight of potential changing the atmosphere around it.

"In Penang, you take a Grab to a guesthouse in George Town. I'll give you the address. You check in. A man will come to the guesthouse at three PM. You give him the suitcase. He gives you an envelope. RM10,000. You take the bus back to KL. And you're done."

"Done," Connor repeated.

"Done. Free. No more phones, no more drops, no more schedule. The footage stays where it is. The records stay where they are. You go to Langkawi, to Bali, to wherever. Back to Melbourne if you want. You're done."

Felix's voice was calm, professional, the voice of a man concluding a business arrangement, the voice that had been calibrated -- through years of recruiting mules in hostels across Southeast Asia, through Lena and the mules before Lena and the mules who would come after Connor -- to deliver the final briefing with authority and reassurance braided together, the two strands indistinguishable. The authority said: *this is happening*. The reassurance said: *and then it's over*.

"What's in the suitcase?" Connor said.

The question was ceremonial. He knew what was in the suitcase. He had known since the rooftop. He had known since the charger box at Wei's. He had known, if he was honest with the honesty that had arrived five weeks too late, since the first envelope. The question was not a question but a ritual -- the last act of the machine, the denial machine, the machine that had run for five weeks on the fuel of *I don't know for certain* and was now running on fumes, on vapour, on the final wisps of a fiction that had been sustaining him since Day 6.

Felix looked at him. Felix's expression was patient -- the patience of a man who had answered this question before, from other mouths, in other rooms, in other hostels in other cities. The question was part of the script. The answer was part of the script. The script had been written by the network and performed by the network and the network had been performing it for years and would continue performing it after Connor was gone.

"Four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine," Felix said. "Sealed in vacuum bags, sewn into the lining of the suitcase. The suitcase will pass a visual inspection. It will pass an X-ray -- the bags are layered between the shell and the fabric lining, the density is consistent with the shell's polymer. It will not pass a dog."

*It will not pass a dog.*

The sentence arrived in Connor's mind and detonated there with the quiet force of a fact that contained its own consequence. The suitcase would pass a visual inspection and an X-ray but would not pass a dog. The sentence meant: if there is a dog at the checkpoint, you are dead. The sentence meant: your life depends on the absence of a dog. The sentence meant: the distance between living and dying is the distance between a bus that is stopped and inspected by an officer with a dog and a bus that is waved through by an officer without one.

"How many checkpoints?" Connor said.

"Usually one. Sometimes none. The North-South Expressway has random checkpoints -- PDRM sets them up on a rotating schedule. Fridays are usually quiet. That's why we're going Friday."

"Usually."

"Usually."

The word *usually* was the margin. The word *usually* was the space between survival and execution. The word *usually* was the width of the plank that Connor was being asked to walk, and the width was determined not by Felix or by Connor but by the Royal Malaysia Police and their deployment schedule and the dogs that the dogs' handlers decided to bring or not bring on a Friday morning on the North-South Expressway between Kuala Lumpur and Penang.

Connor sat in Felix's room and looked at the suitcase and the suitcase was black and mid-size and anonymous and inside it, in the lining, in the vacuum-sealed bags that Wei had sealed in the back room of the phone repair shop, was the substance that Malaysian law considered sufficient to warrant the killing of the person who carried it. The substance was 450 grams. The threshold was 50. The ratio was nine to one. Connor was carrying nine times the amount required to trigger the mandatory death penalty.

Nine to one. Those were not odds. Those were a measurement of how far past the line he had gone, how deep into the territory of irreversible consequence he had travelled. The line was at fifty grams and he was at four hundred and fifty and the distance between them was the distance that separated a prison sentence from a death sentence, a courtroom from a gallows, a life from no life.

"I'll send you the bus ticket tonight," Felix said. "The Grab to TBS leaves at seven-fifteen. The suitcase stays in my room until tomorrow morning. You pick it up at seven. You carry it downstairs. You get in the car. You go."

Connor nodded. The nod was the agreement. The nod was the contract. The nod was the final motion of a man who had been nodding for five weeks -- nodding to envelopes, nodding to packages, nodding to backpacks, nodding to charger boxes -- and the nodding had become the only language he spoke, the language of compliance, the vocabulary of a man who had forgotten how to say no because the machine had removed the word from his dictionary, had replaced it with *yeah* and *sure* and *no worries* and the Australian casualness that was also, it turned out, the perfect language for a drug mule, the language that treated everything as minor, that treated death as an inconvenience, that treated the end of a life as something that would sort itself out.

He left Felix's room. He descended the staircase. The third step squeaked. The common room was empty. The sofa cushions were flat -- Mei Ling had straightened them, erasing the impression of two bodies that had sat there an hour ago, one of them now at seven thousand feet and climbing, the other descending.

Connor went to Bed 7. He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. The towel was smooth and cool, the microfiber that had been to twelve countries and would go to one more -- not as luggage but as evidence, not as comfort but as instrument, the blue fabric that would be present at the end of something that was already ending.

The ceiling fan turned.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

Tomorrow.
# Chapter 29: Running

At three PM on Day 46, Connor Briggs left the Lantern Hostel with his passport in one pocket and RM2,400 in cash in the other and the intention to reach the Thai border before sunrise.

The plan -- if the frantic, half-formed series of decisions that had assembled themselves in the ninety minutes between Felix's room and this moment could be called a plan -- was this: KTM train from KL Sentral to Padang Besar, the border town where the railway crossed from Malaysia into Thailand. The journey was approximately eight hours. If he left now, at three, he'd arrive at Padang Besar by eleven PM. Cross the border on foot -- the land crossing was open until midnight, and the passport control was, according to a blog post he'd found on his phone while sitting on Bed 7 staring at the ceiling, relatively casual on the Malaysian side. Walk into Thailand. Take a bus to Hat Yai. From Hat Yai, another bus to Bangkok. From Bangkok, the Australian Embassy. From the embassy, a flight home. From home, safety.

The plan had the architecture of a fantasy -- each step logical in isolation, the chain of them held together by the same wishful engineering that held together the plans of every desperate person who had ever looked at a map and seen escape as a function of geography rather than circumstance. The plan assumed that Felix did not have contacts at the train station. The plan assumed that the police did not have his name. The plan assumed that the border crossing at Padang Besar was not monitored by the network that Felix operated within, the network that moved methamphetamine between Malaysian cities and had the operational reach to place a man named Rizal in a prison cell at the appropriate time.

The plan assumed many things. Connor was aware of this. He was aware of the plan's fragility in the way that a man climbing a ladder is aware that the ladder is leaning against nothing -- he could feel the wobble, could sense the absence of structural support, could hear the ladder's announcement of its own inadequacy in every creak and shift. But the alternative was the suitcase. The alternative was the eight AM bus to Penang tomorrow morning, the black hard-shell case in the luggage compartment, the five-hour journey through a country that had written his death into its statute books in the specific, unambiguous language of Section 39B, Subsection 2, Dangerous Drugs Act 1952.

The ladder was better than the fall.

He walked to KL Sentral. He didn't take a Grab. Taking a Grab left a digital record -- the pickup address, the destination, the timestamp -- and the digital record was evidence, and evidence was the currency that Felix traded in, and Connor had been generating evidence for five weeks with the prodigal generosity of a man who didn't understand the value of what he was giving away.

The walk took forty minutes. Petaling Street to Jalan Sultan, Jalan Sultan to Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, through the covered pedestrian bridge past Pasar Seni, and then the long straight approach to KL Sentral along Jalan Tun Sambanthan, the road that cut through Brickfields -- Little India, where Connor had delivered a package on Day 9, a package that had been heavier than phone accessories, a package that he'd carried through streets that smelled of incense and jasmine and the spices of a neighbourhood that had existed since before the railway and would exist after everyone currently walking its pavements was gone.

The walk was hot. The afternoon heat of KL was a specific kind of hot -- not the dry heat of desert but the humid heat of a city built on a river confluence at three degrees north of the equator, the heat that saturated the air with moisture and turned every surface into a conductor and every step into a negotiation between the body's desire to cool and the atmosphere's refusal to cooperate. Connor sweated. The sweat ran from his hairline into his eyes, from his armpits into the fabric of his grey T-shirt, from the small of his back into the waistband of his board shorts. The sweating was excessive, even for KL -- the excess was the body's commentary on the situation, the physiological expression of the fear that the mind was trying to contain.

He walked through Brickfields. The Indian shops were open -- the flower garlands hanging in doorways, the banana leaf restaurants preparing for the dinner service, the jewellery shops with their gold in glass cases. A temple bell rang somewhere. The sound was clear and high and lasted longer than it should have, the way temple bells did in neighbourhoods where the buildings were old and the acoustics were shaped by decades of sound bouncing off plaster and stone.

He reached KL Sentral at three fifty. The station was a glass and steel cathedral of transit -- the main hub of KL's rail network, the building where KTM, LRT, monorail, and KLIA Transit converged in a nexus of escalators and platforms and the smell of metal and rubber and the collective anticipation of thousands of people going somewhere. The station was busy. The afternoon crowd was a mix of commuters and travellers, the commuters moving with the purposeful efficiency of people who knew where they were going, the travellers moving with the distracted uncertainty of people who didn't.

Connor was neither commuter nor traveller. Connor was a man running, and the running was visible in the way that running was always visible, even when the legs walked -- in the eyes, which moved too quickly, scanning for threats; in the posture, which was simultaneously rigid and hunched, the body trying to be both alert and invisible; in the hands, which checked the passport pocket every thirty seconds with the compulsive regularity of an anxiety that had found a physical expression.

He found the KTM ticket counter. The counter was on the ground floor, next to a 7-Eleven and a currency exchange. The queue was short -- four people ahead of him, two Malay women with shopping bags, a Chinese man in a business suit, an Indian family with two children. The children were arguing about something, their voices sharp and clear in the station's acoustic space, and the argument was about a toy or a seat or the kind of thing that children argued about when the world was still small enough that a toy or a seat could be the most important thing in it.

Connor waited. The queue moved. The ticket counter was manned by a woman in a KTM uniform -- blue shirt, name badge, the neutral expression of a person who had been selling train tickets for long enough that the act had become autonomous, the fingers moving on the keyboard without the mind's participation.

He reached the counter.

"One ticket to Padang Besar, please. Tonight."

The woman typed. The screen reflected in her glasses. She frowned -- a small frown, the kind produced by data rather than emotion.

"Padang Besar. Tonight. The next train is the 6:15 PM ETS -- Electric Train Service. Arrives Padang Besar at 11:47 PM."

"Yes. That one."

She typed more. The frown deepened.

"Coach A is full. Coach B has..." She paused. "One seat. Window. RM74."

"I'll take it."

She looked up. The look was brief -- the professional assessment of a ticket seller evaluating a customer -- and the assessment took in Connor's face, which was sunburnt and tired and carrying the specific quality of a face that had not slept properly in several days, and his clothes, which were the clothes of a backpacker, which was normal in KL Sentral, which was full of backpackers, and his demeanour, which was the demeanour of a man trying very hard to appear normal and thereby appearing the precise opposite of normal.

"Passport," she said.

Connor handed over his passport. The navy blue Australian passport with the kangaroo and the emu. She scanned the photo page. She typed the number into the system. The system processed the number. The system did whatever systems did with passport numbers -- checked them against databases, flagged them against watchlists, compared them to the lists that existed in the servers of the Royal Malaysia Police and the immigration department and the agencies that monitored the movement of foreign nationals through a country that took the monitoring seriously.

The system processed. Connor waited. The waiting was ten seconds. The ten seconds lasted a year.

"RM74," the woman said.

Connor paid in cash. She printed the ticket. She handed it to him with the passport. The ticket was a small rectangle of thermal paper with the route -- KUALA LUMPUR SENTRAL → PADANG BESAR -- and the time -- 18:15 → 23:47 -- and the coach and seat -- B, 14A -- and the date -- today.

He had a ticket. He had a passport. He had RM2,326 remaining. He had two hours and fifteen minutes until the train departed.

He should have felt relief. The ticket was the exit. The ticket was the door that Priya had been trying to push him toward for five weeks -- not the embassy, not the police, not the courtroom, but the simpler exit, the physical exit, the putting-distance-between-yourself-and-the-danger exit. The ticket was a seat on a train that would carry him away from Felix and the suitcase and the bus to Penang and the checkpoint with or without a dog.

He didn't feel relief. He felt the opposite of relief, which was not dread exactly but the specific, paradoxical anxiety of a person who has committed to an escape and is now more afraid than they were before the commitment, because before the commitment the escape was theoretical and theories don't generate adrenaline, but after the commitment the escape was real and reality generated adrenaline in quantities that the body was not designed to process.

He found a bench. He sat. He held the ticket. He checked his phone -- the real phone, not the burner. No messages. No calls. Priya was in the air. His mother's last text was still on the screen: *Hi darling! So glad to hear from you.*

He looked at the departures board. The 6:15 ETS to Padang Besar was listed. Track 3. On time.

Two hours.

---

At four twenty, a man sat down beside him.

The man was Malay. Forties. Stocky, with the broad shoulders and thick neck of a man who had been physically powerful in his twenties and had maintained some of that power through his thirties and forties by means that were not gym memberships. He wore a black T-shirt and jeans and sneakers and a watch that was either an expensive fake or an inexpensive original and the distinction didn't matter because the watch's function was not timekeeping but display -- the display of a man who wanted other men to see his wrist and draw conclusions.

The man sat on the bench. He did not look at Connor. He looked at his phone. He scrolled. The scrolling was casual, unhurried, the scrolling of a man killing time.

Connor looked at him. The look was instinctive -- the evaluation of a nearby body, the threat assessment that the brain performed automatically in environments of stress. The man was not threatening. The man was sitting on a bench in a train station looking at his phone. The man was one of ten thousand men sitting on benches in KL at this moment, doing exactly this thing.

But the man was sitting close. Not inappropriately close -- the bench was long and there were no other seats available and the proximity was explained by the station's afternoon crowd. But close. Close enough that Connor could smell his cologne -- a sharp, chemical scent, the kind sold in small bottles at night market stalls, the kind that announced itself from a metre away and lingered in a space after the wearer had left.

The man scrolled. Connor held his ticket. The station moved around them.

At four twenty-seven, a second man sat on Connor's other side.

This man was younger. Late twenties. Chinese-Malaysian. Thin, wearing a white polo shirt and khaki trousers, the uniform of a man who worked in an office or wanted to look like he did. He carried a backpack -- not a travel backpack but a commuter backpack, small, nylon, the kind that held a laptop and a lunch container and nothing else.

The second man also looked at his phone. The second man also did not look at Connor. The two men on either side of Connor scrolled their phones in the specific, synchronised non-attention of men who were very much paying attention to the person between them.

Connor's body knew before his mind. The body's knowledge arrived as a sensation -- not a thought but a physical event, a tightening of the muscles across his shoulders and down his spine, the body's ancient response to encirclement, to the reduction of escape routes, to the geometry of two bodies positioned on either side of a third body in a way that was casual and deliberate and terrifying.

He looked left. The stocky man scrolled.

He looked right. The thin man scrolled.

He looked forward. The departures board showed the 6:15 to Padang Besar. Track 3. On time.

He could stand up. He could walk to the platform. He could board the train. The ticket was in his hand. The passport was in his pocket. The platform was fifty metres away, through the turnstiles, down the escalator, across the concourse. Fifty metres was thirty seconds of walking. Thirty seconds was nothing. Thirty seconds was the time it took to reach the platform and board a train that would carry him to the border and to Thailand and to safety.

He stood up.

The stocky man stood up. Not simultaneously -- a second later, the delay calculated to appear coincidental, the way a shadow's movement appeared coincidental to the body's, the shadow rising because the body rose, the relationship causal but denied.

Connor took a step. The thin man stood up. The same delay. The same coincidence.

Connor stopped.

He was standing in KL Sentral with a train ticket to freedom in his hand and two men flanking him like brackets around a word, and the word was his name, and the brackets were the network, and the network had known -- had known before Connor knew, before the plan formed, before the forty-minute walk through Brickfields and the ticket counter and the thermal paper rectangle that said PADANG BESAR. The network had known because the network monitored, because Wei's cameras recorded, because the hostel's geography funnelled all exits through a single door and the door was watched, and the watching was not a person standing and looking but a system that registered movement and reported deviation and dispatched response with the mechanical efficiency of a machine that had been built to prevent exactly this -- the mule's last-minute attempt to bolt.

The stocky man was on his left. One metre. The thin man was on his right. One metre. The geometry was symmetrical, professional, the spacing of men who had done this before and knew the distance that communicated control without attracting attention.

"Connor."

The voice came from behind him. The voice was Malay-accented English, male, calm. Not a voice he recognised. He turned.

A third man. Standing three metres back. Older than the other two -- fifties, grey at the temples, wearing a batik shirt in blue and green, the formal-casual attire of a man who occupied a position that allowed him to choose his own wardrobe. His face was unremarkable -- the kind of face that disappeared into crowds, that was designed by genetics or training or both to resist description, to be forgotten the moment you looked away.

"Felix asked me to give you a message," the man said.

The man reached into his pocket. Connor flinched -- the flinch of a body expecting a weapon, the flinch that the body produced without the mind's permission. But what the man produced was not a weapon. It was a phone. He held it up. The screen was facing Connor.

On the screen, a photo. The photo showed a living room -- Connor's parents' living room. The room he'd grown up in, in Hawthorn, Melbourne. The room with the cream leather sofa and the framed family photos on the mantelpiece and the bay window that looked onto the garden where his father had taught him to kick a football. The photo was recent -- taken through the bay window from outside, the glass reflecting the photographer's flash, the room visible through the reflection, and in the room, on the sofa, his mother. Karen Briggs. Sitting with a cup of tea. Watching television. The photo was taken from outside. From the garden. From the perspective of someone standing in his parents' garden in Hawthorn, Melbourne, at a distance of approximately three metres, looking through a window at his mother.

Connor's legs stopped working.

Not collapsed -- the legs didn't buckle, the knees didn't fail, the body didn't fall. The legs simply stopped. The signals from the brain that instructed the muscles to fire and the joints to flex and the body to move were interrupted, diverted, re-routed to a process that was larger and more urgent than locomotion, the process of absorbing the information that the photo contained.

Felix had someone at his parents' house. Felix had someone who knew where his parents lived, who had stood in their garden, who had photographed his mother through a window. Felix's network extended not just across KL and not just across Malaysia but across the world, to Melbourne, to Hawthorn, to the cream leather sofa where Karen Briggs sat with her tea unaware that a man with a phone was standing in her garden documenting her existence as leverage against her son, twelve thousand kilometres away, in a train station, holding a ticket to the Thai border.

"Felix says the bus is at eight AM tomorrow," the man said. His voice was conversational, pleasant almost, the voice of a man delivering a routine message. "He says you should go back to the hostel and get some rest. He says the train to Padang Besar is not part of the plan."

The man put the phone back in his pocket. He nodded -- a small, polite nod, the nod of a man concluding a business interaction. He turned and walked away. His batik shirt disappeared into the crowd. The stocky man and the thin man also walked away, in different directions, absorbed by the station's afternoon population, dissolved into the mass of commuters and travellers who were going somewhere because they could, because their destinations were chosen and their journeys were voluntary and their arrivals were not appointments with death.

Connor stood alone.

The ticket was in his hand. The train was at six fifteen. Track 3. Fifty metres. Thirty seconds.

His mother's face was in his mind. The cream sofa. The cup of tea. The bay window. The photographer in the garden.

He looked at the ticket. The thermal paper was slightly damp from his palm, the printing beginning to blur at the edges where the moisture met the ink. KUALA LUMPUR SENTRAL → PADANG BESAR. The route to freedom. The route to the Thai border. The route that Felix had anticipated and blocked, not with violence, not with physical restraint, but with a photograph -- a single photograph of a woman on a sofa, the most effective prison ever built, the prison of a son's love for his mother, the love that was the only thing in Connor's architecture that the machine had not processed, the one structural element that could not be rationalised or denied or ignored.

He tore the ticket in half. The two halves fell to the station's tiled floor. A cleaner in a yellow vest would find them later and sweep them into a dustpan and deposit them in a bin and the bin would be emptied into a truck and the truck would carry the ticket to a landfill and the ticket would decompose and the route it described -- Kuala Lumpur to Padang Besar, freedom to the border -- would disappear from the physical world, though it would remain in the KTM booking system as a no-show, a seat that was sold and not occupied, a ghost in the railway's data.

Connor walked back through KL Sentral. Past the ticket counter, past the 7-Eleven, past the currency exchange, past the families and the commuters and the travellers. Past the turnstiles. Past the glass doors. Into the afternoon heat of Brickfields, where the temple bell was still ringing or was ringing again, the sound clear and high and lasting longer than it should have.

He walked back to Petaling Street. The walk took forty minutes. The same route, reversed. The same heat, the same sweat, the same streets. But the walk was different now because the man walking was different -- the man who had walked to KL Sentral had been a man with a plan, a man with an exit, a man who believed that geography could solve what circumstance had created. The man walking back was a man without a plan, without an exit, a man who understood that the trap was not geographical but total, not located in a building or a city but in the network of leverage and surveillance and threat that Felix had built around him with the patience and precision of a man who had done this before and would do it again.

The walk back was the walk of a man returning to his cell.

---

The hostel was quiet when he arrived. The afternoon lull -- the time between checkout and the evening's social energy, the time when the building rested and the fans turned and the red lanterns glowed for no one. The common room was empty. The kitchen was clean. Mama Siti was gone -- her shift ended at two, and the kitchen became, in her absence, a space that was merely functional rather than alive, a room with appliances rather than a room with a cook, the difference being the difference between a house and a home.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. He reached the second-floor landing and stopped.

Uncle Razak was there.

Razak was standing in the corridor outside Dorm 3, leaning against the wall with the posture of a man who had been waiting. He wore his usual attire -- the batik shirt, the reading glasses pushed onto his forehead, the expression of a man who had seen more than he wanted to see and was now in the process of deciding how much of what he'd seen he was willing to act on.

"Connor."

"Uncle Razak."

Razak straightened. He was not a tall man -- five seven, five eight -- but he had the compressed authority of a man who owned the building and had owned it for seventeen years and the owning was not just a legal fact but a physical one, the building responding to his presence the way a ship responded to its captain, the creaks and settlings modulating, the atmosphere adjusting.

"Come," Razak said. "My office."

Connor followed. Razak's office was on the ground floor, behind reception, through a door that was usually locked. Connor had been in the office once -- on Day 11, when Razak had shown him the map, the red pins, the newspaper clippings, the collected record of deaths in hostels worldwide. The map of the dead.

The office was unchanged. The clippings covered the walls -- yellowed newspaper articles, printed web pages, handwritten notes. The map was on the far wall, the large world map with its red pins, each pin a death, each death a story, each story ending in the same place: a building designed for temporary occupancy, a guest who became permanent in the wrong way.

Razak closed the door. He sat behind his desk. The desk was covered in papers -- invoices, booking records, the administrative debris of a business that functioned on the border between hospitality and complicity.

"Sit," Razak said.

Connor sat. The chair was old -- wooden, the seat worn smooth by years of use.

"I know what Felix is asking you to do," Razak said.

The sentence was delivered without preamble, without the gradual approach that most people used when addressing difficult subjects, without the circumlocution and the euphemism and the careful, cowardly navigation of uncomfortable truths. Razak said it the way he said everything -- directly, with the economy of a man who had learned that indirect language was a luxury afforded to people who had time, and time was the one thing they did not have.

"I've known what Felix does since he arrived," Razak continued. "Eighteen months ago. He came to the hostel and he asked for a private room and he paid in cash and he stayed. Weeks. Months. He paid above rate. He was quiet, polite, clean. He didn't cause trouble. He didn't bring trouble into the building. Not at first."

Razak opened a drawer. He took out a folder -- Manila, worn, the kind of folder that contained documents someone had been collecting for a long time. He placed it on the desk.

"I made an arrangement with Felix. An arrangement I am not proud of. The arrangement was this: he could operate from the building as long as he followed rules. No drugs in the hostel. No recruitment of staff. No violence. No attention from the police. The hostel remained clean. The hostel's name remained clean. The guests remained safe."

He opened the folder. Inside: papers, photographs, printouts. Connor could see the edge of a photograph -- a woman, young, blonde, the partial image of a face he didn't recognise.

"The arrangement held for a year. And then Felix started recruiting guests."

Razak's voice changed -- not louder, not angrier, but thicker, heavier, the voice acquiring the weight of something that had been carried for months and was now being set down.

"The first one was a girl from Sweden. Lena. Twenty-two. She was in Bed 7. Your bed."

Connor's body went still. The stillness was not the stillness of calm but the stillness of collision -- the body's response to the impact of information that confirmed what he already knew but had not heard spoken aloud by someone who was not Felix, not Priya, not himself.

"Lena stayed for six weeks. She carried packages for Felix. The same packages you carry. The same routes, the same contacts, the same schedule. She was arrested at the border crossing at Bukit Kayu Hitam, near the Thai border. She had two hundred grams of methamphetamine in a bag. She is now in Kajang Prison. She is awaiting trial. The charge is trafficking. The sentence, if convicted, is death."

Razak paused. The pause was not dramatic but necessary -- the pause of a man who needed to breathe before continuing, the pause of a body managing the physical cost of speaking the truth.

"I did nothing. When Lena was arrested, I did nothing. I told myself that the arrangement was still in place, that Felix had broken the rules, that I would end the arrangement. But I didn't end it. Felix paid. The hostel needed the money. I needed the money. And so the arrangement continued, and Felix recruited another mule -- not from this hostel, from another building, a guesthouse in Bukit Bintang -- and the mule was arrested and the mule is also in Kajang and the arrangement continued because the arrangement was easier than the alternative and the alternative was the police and the police would ask questions about the arrangement and the questions would lead to answers that would end me."

He looked at Connor. The look was not the flat assessment of previous encounters -- not the ex-businessman's calculating gaze, not the hostel owner's professional evaluation. The look was something else. Something older. Something that might, in a man who was less damaged by his own complicity, have been called shame.

"And now you," Razak said. "And now a suitcase. And now I am sitting in my office looking at the next pin on my map and the pin is a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in my building and the pin is tomorrow unless someone does something and the someone is me because there is no one else."

"What can you do?" Connor said.

"I can call the police."

"Felix has the footage. My fingerprints. My--"

"I know what Felix has. I also know what Felix doesn't have. Felix doesn't have a cooperative witness. Felix doesn't have a hostel owner willing to testify about an eighteen-month arrangement. Felix doesn't have Mei Ling's records -- the checkout forms, the booking logs, the dates that match Felix's tenancy with the arrests of mules from this address. Felix doesn't have Tomoko's photographs -- and yes, I know about the photographs, and I know Felix stole the camera, and I know the photographs are backed up to a cloud server because Tomoko told me so three weeks ago."

The information arrived in Connor's mind like a sequence of lights turning on in a dark building -- each fact illuminating a space he hadn't known existed, each fact revealing that the building around him was larger and more complex than the single corridor he'd been walking, that there were other rooms, other people, other stories running parallel to his.

"Tomoko backed up the photos."

"Tomoko is a journalist. Journalists back up everything. The camera was bait -- she let Felix take it because the camera was empty. The real photographs are on a server in Tokyo. She's been waiting to use them."

"Waiting for what?"

"Waiting for someone to cooperate. Photographs without testimony are evidence but not a story. A story requires a voice. Tomoko needs a voice."

"My voice."

"Your voice."

Connor sat in the old wooden chair in Razak's office and looked at the map on the wall and the pins that marked the dead and the space on the map where Kuala Lumpur was, where the pin for the Lantern Hostel would go, where his name would join the list of guests who checked in and never checked out.

"If I cooperate," Connor said. "If I go to the police, or to Ahmad, or to the embassy. Felix has someone in Melbourne. At my parents' house. He showed me a photograph of my mother."

Razak's expression did not change. The information about Melbourne, about the photograph, about the network's reach into Connor's family home -- the information was received and processed by a man who had learned, over eighteen months of the arrangement, to not be surprised by Felix's capabilities.

"Felix's network is not as large as Felix wants you to believe," Razak said. "A photograph through a window is not a man with a weapon. A camera in a garden is not an operation. Felix uses fear the way he uses money -- precisely, economically, at the exact amount required to achieve compliance. The photograph of your mother is not a threat to your mother. It's a threat to your perception. It's designed to make you believe that running is impossible and compliance is the only option."

"How do you know?"

"Because the same photograph was shown to Lena. And to the mule after Lena. The photograph changes -- different house, different parent, different window. The technique is the same. It's a tool. Like the burner phone. Like the CCTV footage. Like the money."

Connor sat with this. The information rearranged something in his mind -- not the fear, which remained, but the architecture of the fear, the structure that Felix had built around it. The structure was not a fortress. The structure was a stage set. The walls were not concrete but painted canvas. The locks were not steel but theatrical props. The fear was real but the infrastructure of the fear was performance -- Felix's most sophisticated product, more valuable than the methamphetamine, more carefully manufactured than the vacuum-sealed bags in Wei's back room.

"What do I do?" Connor said.

"Tomorrow morning. Before eight. Before the bus. You go to Dang Wangi. You ask for Sergeant Ahmad. You tell him everything. I will call Ahmad tonight and tell him you're coming. Tomoko will send her photographs to The Star newspaper at the same time. Mei Ling will provide the hostel records. And the letter that Priya is carrying to London will arrive as confirmation, not as the first report."

The plan was different from Priya's plan. Priya's plan had been the embassy -- the safe option, the diplomatic option, the option that placed Connor under the protection of his own country's bureaucracy. Razak's plan was the police -- the dangerous option, the option that placed Connor directly into the system that would charge him, the option that trusted Ahmad to be clean, to be competent, to be the officer that his business card said he was.

"Ahmad is clean," Razak said, reading Connor's face. "I've known Ahmad for fifteen years. He's Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi district. He's been watching Felix for six months. He doesn't have enough for an arrest -- Felix is careful, the evidence is on the mules, not on the handler. But a cooperating witness changes the calculus. A cooperating witness is the thing Ahmad needs."

"And if he's not clean?"

"Then we are all destroyed. You, me, Mei Ling, Tomoko. The building. Everything. If Ahmad is not clean, then the system is too broken for any of us to survive, and the question of whether you carry the suitcase or don't carry the suitcase is irrelevant because the system will find you either way."

The assessment was brutal and honest, delivered with the flat clarity of a man who had calculated the odds and accepted them. Razak was gambling -- gambling on Ahmad, gambling on the system, gambling on the possibility that the mechanism that had failed Lena might not fail Connor.

"Think about it," Razak said. "Tonight. You have until seven AM. After seven, Felix will give you the suitcase. After the suitcase, the options narrow. Before the suitcase, they're still open."

He stood. The conversation was over. The folder on the desk remained open -- the photographs, the documents, the collected evidence of eighteen months of complicity that Razak was now preparing to trade for something that might be redemption or might be destruction.

"One more thing," Razak said.

Connor looked at him.

"The name on your bed frame. Lena. She carved it with a coin. The night before her last delivery. She told me she wanted someone to know she'd been there."

The information was not new -- Connor had known about the name since the air well, since the night he'd sat on the tile bench and thought about carving his own name. But hearing it from Razak -- from the man who had let Lena sleep in Bed 7 and carry packages and be arrested and said nothing -- hearing it from the man who was trying to not let the same thing happen again -- the hearing was different from the knowing, the way testimony was different from suspicion, the way a spoken truth occupied a different space in the mind than an inferred one.

Connor left Razak's office. He climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked.

---

He lay in Bed 7. The dorm was empty. The afternoon light came through the air well, softer now, the tropical light beginning its evening descent from white to gold to the deep amber that preceded the dark. The ceiling fan turned. The name was under his palm on the bed frame. L-E-N-A.

Two options. Two doors.

Door one: the suitcase. Eight AM. The bus. The five-hour journey to Penang. The checkpoint that might have a dog. The delivery. The RM10,000. The freedom that Felix promised, which was not freedom but the extension of a leash, the lengthening of a chain that would remain attached no matter how far he walked.

Door two: Dang Wangi. Seven AM. Ahmad. The confession. The charge. The cell. The trial. The system that might distinguish between a mule and a dealer, or might not. The system that had killed Lena -- no, not killed, was killing, was in the process of killing, the legal system's particular form of slow killing, the killing that took months and years and appeals and the waiting was its own form of death.

Two doors. One led to a bus. One led to a police station. Both led to places where a blue travel towel would be irrelevant because the places he was going didn't have beaches or showers or the kind of morning that required a towel.

He closed his eyes. The ceiling fan turned. The name pressed against his palm.

Tomorrow. Seven AM or eight AM. Dang Wangi or TBS. Ahmad or the bus. The badge or the suitcase.

The countdown had reached its final digit.

*Tick.*
# Chapter 30: The Suitcase

The last night.

Connor knew it was the last night the way bodies know things that minds refuse to articulate -- not as a thought but as a condition, a state of being, the cellular recognition of finality that preceded the conscious acknowledgement of it the way thunder preceded rain. The body knew. The body had known for days. The body had been preparing for the last night with the quiet, autonomous efficiency of a system shutting down non-essential processes, redirecting resources to the core, the biological equivalent of a building turning off its lights floor by floor as the occupants left.

Day 46. Evening. The sun was setting over Kuala Lumpur with the operatic excess that tropical cities produced -- the sky turning shades of orange and red and purple that would have been dismissed as oversaturated if they'd appeared in a photograph but were, in person, simply the sky doing what the sky did at three degrees north of the equator, the light bending through the atmospheric moisture and the particulate haze and the collective exhalation of eight million lives and producing, at the horizon, a colour that had no name in English but that the Malays called *senja*, which meant dusk, which meant the time between day and night, which meant the time when the world was neither one thing nor the other.

Connor was on the rooftop.

He had come up here because the rooftop was where the story had started -- the rooftop where Felix had stood against the railing on the first night, silhouetted against the Petronas Towers, and said *I could use someone reliable around here*. The rooftop where Connor had sat in a plastic chair and felt the warmth of Felix's attention and mistaken it for friendship. The rooftop where, six weeks ago, a man with a scar on his eyebrow and a linen shirt and a German accent had looked at a broke, lonely Australian backpacker and seen raw material.

The plastic chair was still here. Connor sat in it. The chair was damp with humidity, the same humidity that had been on it the first night, the humidity that was KL's constant companion, the moisture that lived in the air the way fish lived in water -- not as a visitor but as a resident, permanent, inseparable from the medium it occupied.

The Petronas Towers were lit. Twin silver columns against the darkening sky, connected by the skybridge at the forty-first floor, the entire structure performing its nightly transformation from architecture into icon, from building into symbol, from steel and glass into the thing that appeared on postcards and screensavers and the Instagram feeds of a million travellers who had photographed it and captioned it and moved on.

Connor had photographed the towers on his second night. The photo was still on his Instagram -- @ConnorGoesGlobal, the account with 4,200 followers that he hadn't posted to in ten days because posting required the maintenance of a fiction and the fiction had collapsed, the fiction being that he was a content creator on a gap year rather than a drug mule on a countdown. The photo showed the towers at night, lit silver, the sky behind them the deep blue of a KL evening, and the caption read: *These two beauties tho. KL is UNREAL. #PetronasTowers #KualaLumpur #BackpackerLife #LivingTheDream*

Living the dream. He had written that forty-four days ago. The dream was over. The waking was here.

---

At seven PM, Mama Siti appeared on the rooftop.

This was unusual. Mama Siti's domain was the kitchen. She moved between the ground floor and the kitchen the way planets moved in orbits -- predictable, gravitational, defined by a force that was not physical but operational, the force of a woman who had been cooking in the same kitchen for thirty years and had established a territory that extended from the stove to the prep counter to the wash area and no further. The rooftop was not her territory. The rooftop was the territory of guests, of Felix, of the evenings that belonged to the building's transient population rather than its permanent staff.

But Mama Siti was here. She had climbed three flights of stairs -- the narrow, steep staircase that made her knees ache, the staircase that she usually sent younger staff to navigate, the staircase that the building had not been designed for but had acquired during one of its many renovations, the addition of a rooftop access that turned the building's highest point into a social space. She had climbed the stairs and pushed open the door and stepped onto the rooftop and the effort was visible in her breathing, in the slight rise and fall of her chest, in the careful way she placed her feet on the uneven surface.

She carried a plate. The plate held nasi lemak.

Not the morning nasi lemak, which was the standard version -- the coconut rice, the sambal, the ikan bilis, the cucumber, the egg. This was a different version. This was the version that Mama Siti made for occasions, for visits from family, for the Hari Raya celebrations that she prepared with weeks of advance planning. The rice was cooked with extra pandan leaves, the fragrance richer, deeper. The sambal was the special sambal -- the one with fresh-ground chilli and dried shrimp and the particular sweetness that came from palm sugar rather than white sugar. The ikan bilis were fried crisp. The egg was a perfect half-moon of fried egg, the edges lacy, the yolk still soft.

She placed the plate on the zinc table beside Connor's chair. She didn't speak. She stood beside the table with her hands folded in front of her apron and looked at Connor with the expression that she had been wearing since Day 1, the expression that had been there behind every plate of nasi lemak and every proverb and every silence -- the expression of a woman who knew.

"Thank you, Mama Siti," Connor said.

She nodded. The nod was small, economical, the gesture of a woman who conserved movement the way she conserved ingredients -- nothing wasted, everything measured, the minimum necessary to convey the maximum meaning.

She sat on the zinc railing's ledge. Not the chair -- the ledge, which was lower, which brought her closer to the rooftop's surface, which was the posture of a woman who intended to stay.

Connor ate. The nasi lemak was extraordinary. The rice was fragrant, the sambal burned with a heat that was complex rather than aggressive, the ikan bilis were salt and crunch, the egg was perfect. He ate and the food was the best thing he had tasted in six weeks and the tasting was the first time in days that his senses had operated at full capacity, the flavour breaking through the numbness that had insulated him from the physical world since the rooftop conversation with Felix, since the numbers, since the truth.

He ate slowly. He ate the way people ate when the eating was not just nutrition but ceremony -- the way families ate at Christmas, the way friends ate at farewell dinners, the way the condemned ate their last meal, savouring each bite because the bites were countable and the count was low.

Mama Siti watched him eat. Her eyes were dark and still and the stillness was not emptiness but depth, the stillness of water that was very deep, the stillness that concealed rather than revealed.

When he finished, she took the plate. She held it on her lap, the empty plate, the plate that still carried the ghost of the food that had been on it, the residue of coconut oil and sambal and the fragrance that would linger on the ceramic for hours.

"Dulu," she said, "ada seorang budak perempuan." *Once, there was a girl.*

Connor looked at her. Mama Siti's voice was different from her kitchen voice -- not louder but softer, more intimate, the voice of a woman telling a story rather than giving an instruction, the voice that she used for proverbs and the voice that she used for truths and the distinction between the two was smaller than most people realised.

"Dia tinggal di kampung di Perak. She lived in a village in Perak. She was young. She was clever. She wanted to go to the city -- to KL, to the lights, to the life that the village could not give her."

She paused. The pause was part of the story -- the Malay storytelling tradition in which pauses were not absences but presences, the silence between sentences carrying as much meaning as the sentences themselves.

"She came to the city. She found work. She found a room. She found a man who told her she was special, who told her he could help her, who gave her money and attention and the feeling of belonging. The man asked her to carry things. Small things. Envelopes. Then packages. Then bigger packages. The girl carried them because the man had been kind and because the money was good and because she was young and because the young believe that the world is a place where kindness is kindness and money is money and carrying is just carrying."

Connor's chest tightened. The story was not about a girl in a village. The story was about him. The story was about Lena. The story was about every person who had ever been recruited by someone who understood the mechanics of loneliness and the engineering of trust.

"The girl was caught," Mama Siti said. "She was caught at a roadblock on the road to Ipoh. The police found what she was carrying. She was arrested. She was charged. The man who had told her she was special was not there. The man had never been there -- not truly, not in the way that *there* meant being present for the consequence and not just the cause."

She looked at Connor. The look was direct, unfiltered, the look of a woman who had abandoned the indirection of proverbs and the obliqueness of kitchen wisdom and was now speaking in the clear, simple language of a truth that could not be softened.

"The girl is my niece. She is in Kajang Prison. She has been there for four years. Her name is not Lena. Her name is Nurul. And I cook nasi lemak in this hostel because this hostel is where the man who recruited her operated, and I cook here because cooking here is the only way I can watch, and watching is the only way I can try to prevent what happened to Nurul from happening to the next person who sleeps in Bed 7."

The information detonated in Connor's mind. Mama Siti was not a cook. Mama Siti was not a fixture. Mama Siti was a woman whose niece had been destroyed by the same system that was destroying Connor, and the cooking and the proverbs and the silence were not the habits of an eccentric old woman but the surveillance of a woman who had stationed herself at the intersection of the network and the building and was watching, always watching, for the next face that would appear in the kitchen with that hollowed-out look, the eyes going flat, the mouth forgetting how to smile -- the face of a person being consumed by something they couldn't name.

"You've been watching me since Day 1," Connor said.

"Since before Day 1. Since Felix returned. Since I heard he was recruiting again. Since the bed -- your bed, Nurul's bed, Lena's bed -- was occupied by a young foreigner who was broke and lonely and exactly the kind of person Felix looks for."

"Why didn't you tell me? On Day 1. Why didn't you say *the man in the private room is a drug trafficker who will use you and discard you*?"

"I told you. In every way I knew how. The proverbs. The silences. The way I looked at you when you came back from a delivery. The nasi lemak that I made you every morning because the making was the caring and the caring was the warning and the warning was all I had because the direct warning -- the words, the statement, the *Felix is a drug trafficker* -- would have been met with the same response that every mule gives, which is denial, which is *you don't know what you're talking about*, which is the machine's first and strongest defence."

She was right. She was right and the rightness was crushing because it meant that the failure was not hers -- not the failure of a woman who had chosen proverbs over plain speech -- but his, the failure of a man who had received every warning in every form and had refused them all, had processed them through the machine and converted them from warnings into noise, from truth into nuisance, from the voices of people who cared about him into the voices of people who didn't understand.

"What should I do?" Connor said.

It was the question he had asked Priya on Day 39. It was the question he had asked himself in the train station. It was the question that had been sitting at the centre of his life for forty-six days, unanswered, because the question was not really a question -- it was a petition, a plea for someone to make the choice for him, to provide the force that would overcome the inertia, to push him through the door that he could see but could not walk through because walking required the activation of a will that the machine had neutralised.

Mama Siti stood. She was small -- five feet, maybe less -- and standing on the rooftop against the sky she looked smaller, a figure defined not by her height but by her density, the concentrated mass of a woman who had compressed thirty years of watching and cooking and waiting into a body that was small and indestructible.

"Pagi esok," she said. "Saya masak nasi lemak untuk kamu. Kalau kamu datang makan, saya tahu kamu masih hidup."

*Tomorrow morning. I will cook nasi lemak for you. If you come to eat, I will know you are still alive.*

She picked up the empty plate. She walked to the rooftop door. She opened it. She descended the staircase. Her footsteps were quiet -- quieter than a woman her age should have been on stairs that steep, the quiet of a woman who had been navigating this building for thirty years and knew every creak and every silence and the difference between the two.

The door closed. Connor was alone on the rooftop. The Petronas Towers watched. The city hummed. The last light was gone now, replaced by the orange glow of eight million lights reflected off the underside of clouds, the permanent false dawn that KL wore at night, the city's refusal to be dark.

---

He went downstairs at eight. The common room was occupied -- new guests, the rotating population of backpackers who arrived and departed with the regularity of tides, each one bringing a different accent and a different story and the same basic desire: to be somewhere else, to be someone else, to be free. A German couple was playing cards at the coffee table. An Australian girl -- young, maybe twenty, with a backpack that was too big and a smile that was too wide and a luminous, untested confidence -- the glow of a person who had never been afraid of anything because the world had not yet given her a reason -- was FaceTiming someone, her voice bright and loud in the common room's acoustic space.

Connor looked at the Australian girl. She looked like him. Not physically -- she was small and dark-haired and the resemblance was not in the features but in the posture, in the energy, in the way she occupied space with the casual ownership of a person who believed that the world was arranged for her benefit. She was the Connor of Day 1. She was the person he had been before the envelopes and the packages and the charger boxes and the suitcase. She was the person who walked past drug warning signs without reading them and changed the channel when documentaries about drug trafficking appeared on the hostel TV and kissed a woman to avoid answering a question about Malaysian law.

She was him. She was also, potentially, the next one. Felix's next recruit. Felix's next raw material. The next person to sit in a plastic chair on the rooftop and hear the words *I could use someone reliable* and feel the warmth of being chosen.

He wanted to say something to her. He wanted to walk across the common room and sit in the armchair next to hers and say: *Listen. There's a man on the third floor. He's German. He's charming. He'll buy you a beer and tell you stories and make you feel like the most interesting person in the room. And then he'll ask you to carry an envelope. Don't.*

He didn't say it. He didn't say it because saying it would have required explaining how he knew, and explaining how he knew would have required telling the story, and telling the story would have made it real in a way that was different from the way it was real inside his head, which was the only place where the story currently lived, the only place where the story existed in its full, devastating, unedited form.

He climbed the staircase to Dorm 3. The third step squeaked. The dorm was empty -- the Swedish couple and the Korean man were out, exploring, living, doing the things that travellers did in KL on a Friday evening.

Bed 7.

He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. The towel was cool against his skin, the microfiber smooth, the fabric that had been with him through twelve countries and was going to be with him through one more. The towel smelled of sunscreen and the faintly chemical scent of a fabric that had been washed in hostel sinks with hostel soap in seven different countries and had absorbed the olfactory history of his travels -- the salt of the Andaman Sea, the dust of Angkor Wat, the eucalyptus of a Blue Mountains campsite that felt like a different century.

He held the towel against his chest. The towel was the most constant thing in his life. More constant than the hostel, which changed every day -- new guests, new sounds, new configurations of bodies in bunks. More constant than his phone, which he'd cracked and replaced twice. More constant than Felix, who was a function not a person. More constant than Priya, who was gone. The towel was the one thing that had been with him from the beginning and would be with him at the end, and the towel didn't know and the towel didn't care because towels were objects and objects occupied the world without moral engagement, without the burden of choice, without the paralysis that choice produced in a man who had been given too many choices and made the wrong one every time.

He closed his eyes.

The two doors were still there. Dang Wangi and TBS. Ahmad and the bus. The badge and the suitcase.

He thought about Razak's plan. Go to Dang Wangi at seven AM. Ask for Ahmad. Tell everything. Tomoko's photographs would be sent to The Star. Mei Ling's records would be provided. Priya's letter would arrive from London as confirmation. The system would receive multiple inputs simultaneously -- witness testimony, photographic evidence, booking records, a letter from a medical student -- and the system would process the inputs and the output would be... what? An arrest. A charge. A trial. A cell. A sentence that might be death or might be life or might be something in between, depending on the judge, the lawyer, the evidence, the willingness of the system to distinguish between Connor Briggs the mule and Felix Decker the handler.

He thought about Felix's plan. Go to TBS at seven-fifteen AM. Pick up the suitcase at seven. Carry it downstairs. Get in the Grab. Ride to the terminal. Board the bus. Sit in seat 14A or whatever seat the ticket said. Watch KL recede through the rear window. Watch the palm oil plantations stream past. Watch the sky. Arrive in Penang. Deliver the suitcase. Receive RM10,000. Come home.

Come home. The phrase was obscene in its simplicity. *Come home* implied that there was a home to come to, that the hostel was a home, that the bed with LENA carved in the frame was a home, that the building that had been consuming him for six weeks was a place of return rather than a mechanism of destruction.

He opened his eyes. The ceiling fan turned. The blades cast moving shadows on the ceiling -- the shadows of the blades cutting through the ambient light from the air well, the shadows that had been his nightly companions since Day 1, the shadows that would be someone else's nightly companions tomorrow, whether he was on a bus to Penang or in a cell at Dang Wangi.

He reached for his phone. The real phone. He opened the keypad. He typed the number -- the number he'd memorised from the card, the number he'd called two nights ago from this bed, the number that had rung five times and gone to voicemail.

+60 3 2600 ####.

The number was on the screen. The green button waited. The cursor blinked.

He could press it. Right now. Ahmad might answer. Ahmad might be at his desk, working late, the way narcotics officers worked late because narcotics operations happened at night and the officers who tracked them kept the same hours. Ahmad might answer and listen and say *come in tomorrow morning, I'll be here, bring everything you have*. Ahmad might say the thing that would tip the balance, the thing that would provide the force that Connor's will could not generate on its own.

He pressed the button.

One ring. Two rings.

"Dang Wangi, Narcotics. Sergeant Ahmad."

The voice was real. Not voicemail. Not a recording. The voice was a man, awake, at his desk, answering his phone at eight forty-seven PM on a Friday evening because narcotics officers answered their phones because the phones were how the work came in.

Connor opened his mouth.

The silence lasted three seconds. Three seconds in which the connection was open and the signal travelled through the Malaysian telecommunications network from a phone in a hostel dorm in Chinatown to a phone on a desk at Dang Wangi district police headquarters, and in those three seconds the air carried nothing -- no words, no sound, just the electronic hum of an open line, the sound of a connection waiting to be used.

"Hello?" Ahmad said. "Siapa ni?"

Connor closed his mouth. The words were there -- the same words from two nights ago, the same words that had been assembled and ordered and ready. *My name is Connor Briggs. I'm Australian. I've been carrying methamphetamine.* The words were there and the words would not come because the words required air and the air required breathing and the breathing required the belief that the words would lead somewhere better than the silence, and Connor did not believe, could not believe, could not force his body to convert belief into breath and breath into words and words into the act that would save his life.

"Hello?" Ahmad said again.

Connor ended the call.

The phone went dark. The screen returned to the lock screen -- a photo of a sunset over the Andaman Sea, taken three months ago, in a life that had existed before this life, in a version of Connor Briggs that had not yet entered the Lantern Hostel and climbed the staircase and found Bed 7 and placed his hand on a dead woman's name.

He put the phone under his pillow. He put both phones under his pillow -- the real phone and the burner phone, the two identities, the two lives, the two devices that represented the two doors and the choice between them.

He pulled the blue towel over his chest. He closed his eyes. He did not sleep.

---

The call to prayer came at 5:32 AM.

The muezzin's voice from Masjid Jamek entered the air well and rose through the building's open centre and reached the second floor and the dorm and the bed where Connor Briggs lay with his eyes open and his hands flat on the mattress and his body in the raw, humming condition of a body that had not slept -- not tiredness but a different kind of wakefulness -- the wakefulness of a system that had been running all night, processing, calculating, arriving at a conclusion that the conscious mind had not yet been informed of because the conscious mind was the last to know, the last department to receive the memo, the last floor of the building to get the message that the building was on fire.

Day 47.

He got up. He showered. The shower was cold -- the hostel's hot water operated on a first-come basis and the first-come was hours ago, the Swedish couple, who showered at four AM for reasons that no one questioned because questioning other travellers' shower schedules was a violation of hostel etiquette. The cold water hit his skin and the skin contracted and the contraction was the body's response to temperature and the response was mechanical and the mechanics were the only things still functioning, the automatic processes that kept the body operational while the mind was elsewhere, in the space between the two doors, in the corridor that was no longer a corridor but a single point, the point of decision, the point where the two paths met and diverged and one went north and one went south and the man at the point had to choose.

He dressed. Clean clothes -- the last clean clothes from the rotation, the board shorts and the white T-shirt and the Birkenstocks that Priya had called "the most offensive shoes in Southeast Asia." He packed his daypack with the things he would need for the bus: water, his phone charger (the real one, not a Wei's special), his passport, the blue towel.

The blue towel.

He held it. The fabric was soft, familiar, the microfiber that had been his companion through twelve countries. He folded it carefully -- the same fold he always used, the fold that turned the rectangular towel into a compact square that fit in the side pocket of any bag. He placed it in the daypack. The towel was coming with him. The towel was always coming with him. The towel was the one decision that required no deliberation.

He looked at the bed. Bed 7. The thin mattress. The vinyl surface. The wooden frame. The name carved into the underside of the rail -- L-E-N-A -- the name that had been there when he arrived and would be there when he left and would be there when the next guest arrived and placed their hand on the wood without reading it, without knowing, without understanding that the wood was not just wood but testimony, not just a bed frame but a monument, not just letters but a woman who had been there and done this and was now in a cell in Kajang waiting for a verdict that everyone already knew.

He did not carve his name. He had thought about it -- in the air well, two nights ago, he had thought about CONNOR in the wood, five letters, the same length as LENA. But he didn't carve it. Carving would have been an act of acceptance, of resignation, of the belief that his story and Lena's story were the same story. They might be. They probably were. But the carving would have made it certain, and certainty was the one thing Connor Briggs had never permitted himself, the one thing the machine had never produced, because certainty -- in either direction, toward escape or toward doom -- would have required the machine to stop, and the machine stopping would have required Connor to act, and acting was the thing he could not do.

He left the dorm. He closed the door. He did not look back.

---

The staircase. The third step. The squeak.

The ground floor. The reception counter. Mei Ling was there -- early, earlier than usual, behind the desk with the old desktop computer and the stack of checkout forms and the guest register. She looked up when Connor descended. Their eyes met. Her eyes held the same information that Razak's eyes had held, that Mama Siti's eyes had held -- the information of knowledge, the information of complicity, the information of a building full of people who knew what was happening and were waiting to see which door he would walk through.

He turned left. Not right, toward the front door, toward the Grab that would take him to TBS. Left, toward the kitchen. Toward the smell of coconut rice and sambal and pandan. Toward the stove where a small woman in an apron was cooking nasi lemak at five forty-five AM because the cooking was the watching and the watching was the caring and the caring was the last thread connecting Connor Briggs to the world of people who wanted him to live.

Mama Siti was at her station. The stove was lit. The rice was steaming. The sambal was in the stone mortar, being ground with the pestle that she'd brought from Perak thirty years ago, the pestle that was smooth from use and stained with decades of chilli and shrimp paste and the accumulated chemistry of a lifetime of cooking.

She saw him. She stopped grinding. She looked at his face. She looked at his daypack. She looked at the Birkenstocks on his feet and the clean white T-shirt and the board shorts and the posture of a man who was not going to Dang Wangi, who was not going to Ahmad, who was going upstairs to the third floor to collect a black hard-shell suitcase with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in its lining and carry it downstairs and out the door and to a bus terminal and onto a bus and through a country that would kill him for what was in the suitcase's lining.

She knew. She read his body the way she read everything -- with the total, involuntary attention of a woman who had been reading bodies for thirty years, the way a doctor reads X-rays, the way a mechanic reads engine sounds, the way a cook reads the colour of oil to know when it was ready.

She served the nasi lemak. The plate came across the counter -- the banana leaf, the rice, the sambal, the ikan bilis, the egg, the cucumber. The complete breakfast. The ceremony.

Connor ate. He ate slowly. He ate the way he had eaten last night on the rooftop, with the attention that was owed to food that was made by a woman who was cooking not for a guest but for a person, not for a transaction but for a life, not for the RM15 that the meal cost but for the possibility that the meal might be the last thing she could give.

The nasi lemak was perfect. The rice was fragrant. The sambal burned. The ikan bilis were crisp. The egg was perfect. The cucumber was cool and clean, the green freshness cutting through the heat of the sambal, the contrast that made Malaysian food Malaysian food -- the heat and the cool, the spice and the sweet, the fire and the water, the things that existed only in relation to their opposites.

He finished. He placed the fork on the plate. He looked at Mama Siti.

"Terima kasih," he said. *Thank you.*

She took the plate. She held it. She did not place it in the wash area. She held it on the counter in front of her, the empty plate, the plate that was evidence that Connor had come and eaten and was still alive, the plate that was the answer to the question she had asked on the rooftop: *If you come to eat, I will know you are still alive.*

He was still alive. He was still alive, and the alive was about to change categories, from the alive of a man who was free to the alive of a man who was carrying, from the alive of possibility to the alive of consequence, from the alive that had options to the alive that had only one direction, which was forward, which was upstairs, which was the third floor, which was Felix's door, which was the suitcase.

"Jaga diri," Mama Siti said. *Take care of yourself.*

The words were the simplest words. The words were the words that mothers said and grandmothers said and the women who ran kitchens in hostels said to the young people who passed through their buildings, the words that were simultaneously the most common farewell and the most profound instruction, because *jaga diri* was not just *be careful* but *be guardian of yourself*, the imperative not just of caution but of self-preservation, the command to treat the self as something worth guarding.

Connor nodded. He turned. He walked to the staircase. He climbed.

Not down. Not out. Not to the Grab. Not to Dang Wangi. Not to Ahmad.

Up. To the third floor. To Felix's door.

The third step squeaked. The Japanese characters watched from under their paint. The second-floor landing passed. The third-floor corridor stretched ahead -- narrow, dim, the overhead light a single fluorescent tube that cast the flat blue-white light of places where beauty was irrelevant.

Felix's door was at the end of the corridor. The door was open.

Felix was inside. He was dressed -- the linen shirt, the chinos, the leather driving gloves. The gloves. The gloves that Connor had noticed and commented on and accepted and the accepting was the first act of the machine, the machine's first production, the conversion of the gloves from evidence into eczema, from truth into trivia.

The suitcase was on the bed. Black. Hard-shell. Mid-size. The suitcase that would fit in the luggage compartment of a Transnasional bus without attracting attention, the suitcase that looked like every other suitcase, the suitcase that was anonymous and lethal and waiting.

"Seven AM," Felix said. "Right on time."

Connor looked at the suitcase. The suitcase looked back. Not with eyes -- suitcases did not have eyes. But with the dense, gravitational presence of an object that contained a death sentence, the way a loaded weapon contained a death, the potential compressed into plastic and fabric and the four hundred and fifty grams of white crystalline substance that was sewn into the lining by hands that wore gloves.

"The Grab is downstairs in fifteen minutes," Felix said. "TBS. The bus is at eight. Seat 22B. The suitcase goes in the luggage compartment. You sit on the bus. You don't touch the suitcase until Penang."

Connor picked up the suitcase.

The suitcase was heavy. Not dramatically heavy -- not the weight of the red Deuter backpack, not the seven kilograms that had strained his shoulders on the walk to Sentul. The suitcase weighed approximately ten kilograms, which was the weight of the suitcase itself -- the shell, the lining, the zipper, the wheels, the telescopic handle -- plus the weight of the clothes that Felix had packed inside it as cover, a tourist's clothes, T-shirts and shorts and a toiletry bag, the fiction of a man travelling from KL to Penang for a holiday rather than a delivery. The methamphetamine, at four hundred and fifty grams, was less than half a kilogram. Less than a bag of sugar. Less than a bottle of water. The substance that would kill him weighed less than his laptop.

He held the suitcase by the handle. The handle was plastic, moulded, the kind that fit the hand with the ergonomic precision of mass production. The handle was warm -- not from use but from the room's ambient temperature, the heat of a third-floor room in a building without air conditioning in a city at three degrees north.

"Connor."

He looked at Felix.

Felix's expression was the expression he always wore -- the neutral, professional, faintly pleasant expression of a man conducting business. But beneath the expression, or perhaps projected onto it by Connor's newly acquired clarity, there was something else. Not warmth. Not cruelty. Something closer to recognition -- the recognition that one human gives another at the moment of a transaction that both know is final, the look that the handler gives the mule, the employer gives the worker, the system gives the component as the component is fed into the machine for the last time.

"Be safe," Felix said.

The words were identical to Mama Siti's. *Jaga diri. Be safe.* The same words, from two people, meaning opposite things. From Mama Siti, the words meant: *please live*. From Felix, the words meant: *please don't get caught*. The difference between the two meanings was the difference between love and utility, between a woman who cared whether Connor survived and a man who cared whether the delivery was completed.

Connor carried the suitcase out of Felix's room. He walked down the third-floor corridor. He reached the staircase.

He descended. Third floor to second floor. The landing. Dorm 3's door, closed, behind it the empty bed, the blue towel gone from the pillow, the name on the frame waiting for the next hand.

Second floor to first floor. The third step squeaked. The last squeak. The last time the staircase would announce Connor Briggs's passage through the building's vertical geography, the last time the old wood would register his weight and produce the sound that it had produced for every occupant since 1928, the sound that was not a squeak but a record, a tally mark, a count.

Ground floor. The common room. The kitchen. The reception counter where Mei Ling sat and watched and said nothing because everything she had to say had been said and the saying had not been enough and the not-enough was the hostel's tragedy -- the tragedy of a building full of warnings that were issued and ignored, the tragedy of a system designed to help that could not overcome the system designed to harm.

Connor walked past reception. Mei Ling looked at him. He looked at her. The look lasted one second. In the second, the information passed -- the suitcase, the direction, the decision, the failure. Mei Ling's face did not change. Her hands, flat on the reception counter, did not move. Only her eyes moved -- tracking Connor as he walked from the staircase to the front door, the brief traverse of the ground floor that was the building's final opportunity to hold him, to slow him, to produce one more creak or one more shadow or one more proverb that might, at the last possible moment, change the direction of the story.

The building did not produce anything. The building was silent. The building had done what it could -- the squeaking step, the red lanterns, the air well's breathing, the spaces where warnings lived. The building had been the medium through which Mama Siti and Mei Ling and Razak and the ghost of Lena had tried to reach Connor Briggs, and the building had failed, not because the building was inadequate but because the man was, not because the walls were too thick but because the denial was thicker, not because the building couldn't speak but because the man couldn't listen.

Connor pushed open the front door. The morning heat of Petaling Street hit him. The market vendors were setting up. The smell of fried dough and diesel and incense. The sound of the city waking -- engines, voices, the call to prayer fading into the morning's accumulated noise.

The Grab was at the kerb. A silver Proton Saga. Different driver. Same destination energy -- the patient, incurious expression of a man who drove people to bus stations every morning and didn't ask where they were going or what they were carrying.

Connor loaded the suitcase into the boot. The suitcase went in alongside the driver's emergency triangle and a bottle of water and a prayer bead tassel that hung from the boot's interior. The boot closed. The suitcase disappeared.

He got into the back seat. He closed the door. He put on his seatbelt. The driver pulled away from the kerb.

The Lantern Hostel receded in the rear window. The red lanterns. The pre-war facade. The narrow staircase behind the door. Mama Siti's kitchen. Bed 7. The name on the frame.

The hostel grew smaller. The hostel became the street. The street became the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood became the city. And in the boot of a silver Proton Saga, in a black hard-shell suitcase, four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine travelled through Kuala Lumpur's morning traffic toward Terminal Bersepadu Selatan, where a bus was waiting, and the bus was going to Penang, and Penang was five hours away, and between here and there was the North-South Expressway and the checkpoint that might have a dog.

The ceiling fan was still turning in Dorm 3. The name was still on the bed frame. The building was still breathing.

And the next part of the story -- the last part, the part that had been written in statute books and court records and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 and the name LENA carved in wood -- the next part had begun.

---

*End of Part 3: Crisis*
# Chapter 31: Terminal

Terminal Bersepadu Selatan was designed to process human beings the way factories processed raw material -- efficiently, in volume, without sentiment.

The building was vast -- a steel and glass cathedral of transit, opened in 2010, serving as the southern gateway for buses departing Kuala Lumpur to every destination the peninsula offered: Penang to the north, Johor Bahru to the south, Kuantan to the east, and every kampung and city in between. The architecture was modern -- clean lines, high ceilings, the aesthetic of a country that was building its future out of concrete and ambition and the particular Malaysian combination of Islamic geometry and corporate minimalism. The floor was polished tile, the walls glass, and the air conditioning aggressive, the temperature dropping ten degrees between the outside heat and the interior cool, the transition so sharp it felt like entering a different climate, a different country, a different phase of existence.

Connor entered TBS at seven forty-two AM carrying a black hard-shell suitcase that contained four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine and the clothes of a man who was pretending to go on holiday.

The Grab driver had made the trip from Petaling Street to TBS in twenty-seven minutes. The traffic had been light -- Friday morning, the roads emptier than weekdays, the city moving at the reduced tempo of a population that understood that Friday was for the mosque and for family and for the things that mattered more than work. The driver had played Malay pop on the car stereo -- a woman's voice, sweet and melancholy, singing about something Connor couldn't translate but could feel, the emotional content transcending the language barrier the way all good music did.

It was in the boot. Connor had loaded it himself and unloaded it himself and the loading and unloading had been the actions of a man performing a task he had rehearsed -- not physically, not in practice, but in the theatre of his imagination, where he had been carrying this suitcase for days, carrying it in his dreams and his sleepless hours and the corridors of his mind where the suitcase waited like a prop for a play that had been written before he was born.

He rolled the suitcase across the TBS concourse. The wheels hummed on the polished tile -- a low, smooth sound, the sound of plastic on stone, the sound that every suitcase made in every terminal in every country, the universal frequency of departure. The suitcase rolled easily. The telescopic handle extended to the right height. The wheels tracked straight. The suitcase was, in its mechanical operation, flawless -- the anonymous, functional perfection of a mass-produced object doing exactly what it was designed to do.

The concourse was busy. Morning departures generated a crowd that was diverse in the specific way that Malaysian crowds were diverse: Malay families in modest dress, the women in tudung, the men in collared shirts; Chinese-Malaysian businesspeople with laptop bags and the brisk efficiency of people who treated buses as moving offices; Indian-Malaysian students with backpacks and earbuds; foreign tourists with oversized luggage and the bewildered expressions of people navigating a system designed for locals.

Connor was one of the tourists. His appearance -- the board shorts, the white T-shirt, the Birkenstocks, the sunburn, the daypack -- placed him in the category instantly. A backpacker. A traveller. A young foreigner taking a bus to Penang, probably for the beaches, probably for the food, probably for the Instagram content that Penang's street art and hawker stalls generated in quantities that made the city one of Southeast Asia's most photographed destinations.

He was invisible. The category made him invisible. The category was a costume, and the costume was so complete, so consistent with the thousands of other backpackers who passed through TBS every week, that no one looked twice. The ticket counter attendant processed his booking with the mechanical attention of a person who had sold ten thousand tickets. The security guard at the gate glanced at his ticket and waved him through. The porter who directed passengers to the correct bay pointed at Bay 14 without making eye contact.

Bay 14. Transnasional service 1087. Kuala Lumpur to Penang. Departing 08:00. Arriving approximately 13:00.

The bus was a double-decker -- a Scania, white with blue stripes, the Transnasional logo on the side, the windshield tinted against the morning sun. The luggage compartment was open, the belly of the bus yawning, the interior a dark cavity lined with rubber matting that smelled of diesel and the accumulated journeys of a vehicle that had made this trip thousands of times.

Connor handed the suitcase to the luggage handler. The handler was a Malay man in a Transnasional uniform -- blue polo shirt, company cap, the build of a man who spent his days lifting luggage and the posture of a man for whom luggage was luggage, all the same, all heavy, all going somewhere. He took the suitcase by the handle. He lifted it. He placed it in the compartment alongside the other bags -- duffle bags, backpacks, suitcases of every size and colour, the collective cargo of forty-four passengers heading north.

The suitcase was in the bus. The suitcase was no longer in Connor's hands. The physical separation -- the three metres between his body and the suitcase, the steel floor of the luggage compartment between his feet and the drugs -- changed nothing legally. Legally, the suitcase was his. The ticket had his name. The booking had his passport number. The suitcase's contents, if discovered, would be attributed to the person whose name was on the ticket, which was Connor James Briggs, Australian passport number PA7834521, Bed 7, Dorm 3, the Lantern Hostel, 28 Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur.

But the physical separation changed something else. It changed the sensation. It was no longer pulling his arm, no longer connected to his body by the handle, no longer the physical extension of himself that it had been for the past forty-two minutes. The suitcase was in the dark. It sat with other bags. It was anonymous, invisible, one object among thirty, and the anonymity was a form of relief -- the relief of a man who has put down a heavy thing and can, for a moment, pretend the heavy thing doesn't exist.

He boarded the bus. Climbed the stairs to the upper deck. Found seat 22B -- window seat, right side, midway along the upper deck. The seat was the standard bus seat: fabric upholstery in a blue-grey pattern designed to hide stains, a headrest that adjusted, a recline function, a footrest. The seat was clean, the air conditioning on. The window was large, tinted, the outside world visible through a filter of grey-blue that muted colours and softened edges, the world as seen through sunglasses, the world at a remove.

He sat. He put his daypack on the floor between his feet. He put his seatbelt on. He looked out the window.

TBS's bus bays stretched in a row -- twenty, thirty bays, each with a bus or the space for a bus, the bays numbered and labelled with destinations: JOHOR BAHRU, MELAKA, IPOH, KUANTAN, BUTTERWORTH, PENANG. The destinations were the geography of a country spread across a peninsula, connected by roads that the British had built and the Japanese had bombed and the Malaysians had rebuilt and expanded into a highway network that was the circulatory system of a nation, the arteries through which people and goods and the invisible currents of commerce moved from city to city, state to state, north to south and back.

The bus began to fill. Passengers climbed the stairs and found their seats and performed the rituals of bus travel: adjusting headrests, connecting earbuds, opening snacks, arranging blankets. An elderly Malay couple took the seats across the aisle -- the woman in a blue tudung, the man in a batik shirt, their movements synchronised by decades of shared travel, the coordination of two people who had been sitting beside each other on buses for longer than Connor had been alive. Behind Connor, a young Chinese-Malaysian woman opened a laptop and began typing, the keys clicking in a rapid, competent rhythm. In front of him, a Malay teenager put on noise-cancelling headphones and closed his eyes.

The bus was filling with ordinary people doing an ordinary thing on an ordinary Friday morning. Going to Penang. Going north. Going to see family or attend a meeting or start a holiday or return to a life that was waiting at the other end of five hours and four hundred kilometres of North-South Expressway.

Connor was doing none of these things. Connor was carrying a suitcase. The suitcase was in the compartment beneath his feet, beneath the floor of the upper deck, beneath the layers of steel and rubber and the other bags. The suitcase was down there with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in vacuum-sealed bags sewn into the lining, and the suitcase was waiting, patient as stone, for the journey that would either deliver it to Penang or deliver Connor to a cell.

The engine started. The bus vibrated -- a deep, diesel vibration that travelled through the chassis and the seats and into the bodies of the passengers, the mechanical heartbeat of a vehicle preparing to move. The driver appeared on the intercom -- a voice in Malay, then English, then Mandarin, delivering the standard announcements: welcome, destination, duration, rest stop, safety.

"Selamat datang ke perkhidmatan Transnasional nombor satu kosong lapan tujuh. Destinasi kami ialah Penang Sentral. Perjalanan mengambil masa lebih kurang lima jam..."

*Welcome to Transnasional service 1087. Our destination is Penang Sentral. The journey will take approximately five hours...*

The English translation followed: rest stop at Tapah, approximately two hours in. No smoking. Seatbelts required. Emergency exits marked. Thank you for travelling with Transnasional.

The bus reversed out of Bay 14. The movement was slow, heavy, the deliberate manoeuvring of a vehicle that was forty-five feet long and carried forty-four passengers and their luggage and the weight of all their reasons for travelling. The bus straightened. The bus moved forward. The bay disappeared. TBS disappeared. The bus entered the access road that led to the highway.

Connor watched through the tinted window. KL was passing. The southern suburbs -- the apartment blocks and the shopping centres and the construction sites that were the permanent condition of a city that was always building, always growing, always adding to itself. The skyline was behind him now, the Petronas Towers visible in the rear window of the upper deck, the twin silver columns growing smaller as the bus moved north, the towers that had been his constant landmark for forty-seven days shrinking to the size of fingers, then needles, then nothing.

The bus merged onto the North-South Expressway. The highway was six lanes -- three north, three south, divided by a concrete median, the surface smooth black asphalt that the tyres hummed on, the hum blending with the air conditioning and the engine and the accumulated sounds of forty-four people settling into the specific condition of bus travel, which was the condition of waiting -- waiting for the destination, waiting for the rest stop, waiting for the journey to end.

Connor was waiting for the checkpoint.

---

The North-South Expressway was the longest highway in Malaysia. Eight hundred kilometres from Johor Bahru in the south to Bukit Kayu Hitam at the Thai border in the north, cutting through the peninsula's western states -- Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Penang, Kedah -- the highway was the spine of Peninsular Malaysia, the central axis around which the country's road network organised itself.

The highway was also where the checkpoints were.

PDRM -- Polis Diraja Malaysia, the Royal Malaysia Police -- operated random checkpoints on the expressway. The checkpoints were not permanent installations but mobile operations, set up and taken down on a rotating schedule that was, according to Felix, unpredictable by design. The police chose locations based on intelligence, traffic patterns, and the operational requirements of whatever enforcement campaign was currently active: drunk driving during festivals, immigration checks during border surges, drug interdiction during... always. Drug interdiction was always active. The Dangerous Drugs Act was not seasonal. The death penalty was not seasonal. The law operated year-round, checkpoint by checkpoint, dog by dog, the steady, mechanical enforcement of a statute that had been in effect since 1952 and showed no sign of changing.

Felix had said Fridays were usually quiet. Felix had said the checkpoints were less likely on Fridays because the traffic was lighter and the police resources were allocated to the weekend operations -- the clubs, the bars, the entertainment districts where drug use was visible and arrests were easy and the statistics looked good in reports. Felix had said *usually*.

Connor sat in seat 22B and watched the highway unfold and the word *usually* was the only word in his vocabulary, the word that his mind repeated on a loop, the word that was simultaneously a comfort and a threat, the word that meant *probably safe* and *possibly not* and the gap between the two was the gap that his life depended on.

The bus passed kilometre markers. The markers were green signs with white numbers, counting up from KL: KM 50, KM 75, KM 100. Each marker was a unit of distance from the city and a unit of distance toward Penang and a unit of distance through the territory where checkpoints existed, the territory that Connor was traversing at one hundred and ten kilometres per hour in a vehicle that contained, in its belly, the substance that triggered Section 39B.

He watched the landscape. The highway cut through terrain that alternated between the two dominant conditions of Peninsular Malaysia: palm oil plantations and jungle. The plantations were geometric -- rows of oil palms stretching to the horizon in parallel lines, the regularity of industrial agriculture imposed on land that had been jungle before the British arrived and decided that the jungle was wasteful and the oil palm was profitable. Between the plantations, remnants of the original forest survived -- hills covered in green, the canopy dense and dark, the kind of green that existed only in equatorial forests, the green of maximum photosynthesis, of chlorophyll working at the peak of its evolutionary efficiency.

The bus moved through this landscape at speed, the scenery streaming past the tinted windows in a blur of green and grey and the occasional interruption of a town -- Seremban, the capital of Negeri Sembilan, visible from the highway as a cluster of buildings and minarets; then smaller towns, kampungs, the wooden houses on stilts that were the traditional Malay dwelling, the houses that looked fragile from the highway but were in fact resilient, designed for floods and heat and the specific conditions of a tropical climate.

Connor watched and saw nothing. The landscape was there but he was not receiving it. His senses were allocated entirely to the road ahead -- scanning for the signs of a checkpoint: the orange cones, the police vehicles, the barriers that narrowed the highway from three lanes to one, the officers in blue standing at the shoulder with their hands out, their faces carrying the professional blankness of men who had been stopping vehicles for hours and would continue stopping vehicles for hours more.

No cones. No barriers. No officers. The highway was clear. The first hour passed. KM 100. KM 125. KM 150.

The bus was quiet. The passengers had settled into the particular torpor of long-distance bus travel -- the headphones in, the eyes closed, the phones held loosely, the collective surrender to the vehicle's motion and the air conditioning's hum and the gentle, rocking progress of a bus moving north on a good road. The elderly couple across the aisle had opened a container of kuih -- traditional cakes, small, colourful, the kind that grandmothers made and carried in Tupperware for journeys. The woman offered Connor a kuih. He took it. It was green -- pandan-flavoured, coconut-filled, sweet. He ate it. The taste was good. The taste was the taste of a normal thing happening on a normal bus on a normal day, and the normalcy was unbearable because the normalcy was a lie and the lie was the last lie, the lie of a man eating a pandan cake on a bus that was carrying enough methamphetamine to trigger a death sentence, the lie so perfect and so complete that even Connor, who knew it was a lie, could almost believe it.

He thanked the woman. "Terima kasih, makcik." The Malay word for auntie -- *makcik* -- the respectful address that Priya had taught him in their first week, the word that Priya had said was important because language was not just communication but relationship, and relationship was how you survived in a country that was not your own.

The woman smiled. The smile was warm, genuine, the smile of a grandmother who had offered food to a young foreigner and received the correct response. She did not know what was in the luggage compartment. She did not know that the polite young man in the white T-shirt was carrying her country's death sentence in a suitcase twenty feet below her seat. She smiled because smiling was what you did when a stranger said *makcik* and meant it, and Connor had meant it, and the meaning was the last authentic thing he'd produced, the last word that came from the person rather than the machine.

---

The rest stop at Tapah arrived at ten fifteen.

Tapah was a service area on the expressway -- a large building with restaurants, a convenience store, a prayer room, toilets, and a parking area where the buses stopped and the passengers disembarked and stretched their legs and bought food and performed the rituals of the rest stop, which were the same rituals in every country: eat, drink, use the bathroom, stand in the sun for five minutes, get back on the bus.

The bus pulled into the parking area. The driver announced fifteen minutes. The passengers rose -- slowly, stiffly, the collective unbending of forty-four bodies that had been seated for two hours. They filed down the stairs and out the door and into the heat of Tapah, which was the heat of a service area in Perak at ten fifteen in the morning, the heat magnified by the asphalt parking lot and the reflected light from the building's glass facade and the exhaust from a dozen idling buses.

Connor got off the bus. He stood in the parking area and looked at the luggage compartment. The compartment was closed. The luggage handler had not opened it -- the rest stop was for passengers, not cargo, and the cargo remained in the dark, in the compartment, where it had been since TBS.

He went to the toilet. He washed his hands. He looked at his face in the mirror. The face was the face of a man who had not slept and had eaten one plate of nasi lemak and had been on a bus for two hours with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine under his feet. The face was thin -- thinner than it had been forty-seven days ago, the weight lost not to diet or exercise but to the metabolic cost of sustained fear, the body burning calories to fuel the anxiety that had been his constant companion since the first envelope. His eyes were bloodshot, his skin grey under the sunburn, his mouth a line -- not frowning, not neutral, just a line, the expression of a man who had used up all his expressions and was left with the default, which was nothing.

He splashed water on his face. He dried it with a paper towel. He went to the convenience store and bought a bottle of water and a packet of Mamee noodle snacks, the bright yellow packet that was in every convenience store in Malaysia, the crunchy, MSG-laden snack that tasted like childhood to every Malaysian and like novelty to every tourist and like nothing to Connor, who ate them standing in the parking area beside the bus, crunching the dry noodles and drinking the water and watching the highway where cars and trucks and motorcycles passed in a continuous stream, the traffic flowing north and south, the arterial pulse of a country moving.

He looked north. The highway stretched ahead, straight and flat, disappearing into the haze that hung over the landscape. Somewhere up there, between here and Penang, was the checkpoint. Or wasn't. The checkpoint existed in a state of quantum uncertainty -- present and absent simultaneously, real and imaginary, the observation collapsing the wave function, the dog or no dog, the stop or the wave-through, the life or the death.

*Usually quiet on Fridays.*

He got back on the bus. Seat 22B. Seatbelt. The window. The driver started the engine. The bus reversed. The bus moved forward. Tapah receded. The highway opened ahead.

KM 200. KM 225. KM 250.

The second hour began.

---

At eleven twenty-two, the bus slowed.

The slowing was gradual -- not the abrupt deceleration of a stop but the controlled reduction of speed that buses performed when approaching something ahead, the driver's foot easing off the accelerator, the engine note dropping, the vibration changing frequency, the bus transitioning from highway speed to something slower, more cautious, the speed of a vehicle approaching an event rather than a distance.

Connor looked through the windshield. The upper deck gave him a view over the highway that the lower deck passengers didn't have -- the elevated perspective of a seat four metres above the road surface, the view that showed the road ahead for a kilometre or more.

Orange cones.

The cones were visible first. Small, bright, the orange that was designed to be seen, the colour of warning, the colour of deviation from the normal. The cones were arranged in a line across the highway's left lanes, funnelling three lanes into one, the traffic narrowing, the cars ahead slowing, the collective deceleration of a hundred vehicles responding to the presence of the cones the way a river responded to a narrowing channel -- pressure building, speed reducing, the flow compressing.

Behind the cones, vehicles. Police vehicles. Blue and white Proton Wira patrol cars, parked on the shoulder. Two of them. No, three. And a van -- a larger vehicle, the kind used for operations that required space, the kind that carried equipment, the kind that carried dogs.

The word *dog* arrived in Connor's mind and detonated there with the force of a bomb that had been ticking since TBS.

He couldn't see a dog. The distance was too great -- five hundred metres, maybe six hundred. The vehicles were there, the officers were there, the cones were there, but the dog was not visible at this distance, the dog being a detail that required proximity to confirm, and proximity was coming, metre by metre, as the bus slowed and the distance closed and the five hundred metres became four hundred became three hundred and the details of the checkpoint resolved from a general blur into specific images: officers in blue, a raised hand, a barrier across the single open lane, a table set up on the shoulder where papers were examined and questions were asked.

Connor's body responded before his mind. The body produced adrenaline -- the surge that arrived not as an emotion but as a physical event, the heart rate spiking, the blood redirecting, the extremities tingling with the primal electricity of a body preparing for something it had been preparing for since the first envelope on Day 6. The adrenaline was not new -- it had been present, in lower doses, since he'd picked up the suitcase this morning, a background hum of chemical readiness. But the cones triggered a spike, a peak, the body's recognition that the theoretical had become actual and the actual required response.

His hands gripped the armrests. The grip was tight, the knuckles white, the tendons visible beneath the skin. The grip was involuntary -- the body's attempt to hold onto something solid in a moment when everything else was fluid, uncertain, the moment when the road ahead was no longer a road but a gate, and the gate was controlled by men in blue who had the authority to open the luggage compartment and the training to recognise what was in the suitcase's lining.

The bus was three hundred metres from the checkpoint. Two hundred and fifty. Two hundred.

He could see the officers now. Three of them. Two at the barrier, one at the table. They wore the blue uniform of the PDRM -- the standard patrol uniform, short-sleeved shirts, dark trousers, the peaked caps with the royal insignia. One officer had a clipboard. One had a flashlight -- unnecessary in the daylight but carried as a tool, the flashlight's purpose not illumination but examination, the focused beam that could be directed into a luggage compartment's dark interior to reveal what the ambient light concealed.

No dog. Connor's eyes scanned the checkpoint with the desperate thoroughness of a man looking for the one detail that determined whether he lived or died. No dog at the barrier. No dog at the table. No dog visible near the vehicles. No handler with a leash. No kennel. No dog.

But the van. The van was there, and the van was the kind that carried dogs, and the van's rear doors were closed, and the closed doors could mean the van was empty or the van was occupied and the dog was inside and the dog was waiting and the van's doors would open when the van's handler decided to deploy the dog and the deployment might happen now or might happen for the next vehicle or might not happen at all.

One hundred and fifty metres. One hundred. The bus was decelerating through forty, thirty, twenty kilometres per hour. The brake lights of the cars ahead were a chain of red, the line of vehicles narrowing to single file, the traffic feeding through the gap in the cones like sand through an hourglass, one vehicle at a time, the checkpoint processing each vehicle with the methodical patience of a system designed for exactly this -- the interception, the examination, the sorting of the compliant from the non-compliant, the clean from the dirty, the innocent from the guilty.

Fifty metres. The bus stopped.

The bus was in the queue. Three vehicles ahead -- a sedan, a pickup truck, another sedan. The officers were processing the first sedan. The driver had his window down. An officer was leaning in, speaking, the conversation invisible from the bus but the body language readable: the officer's posture was relaxed, professional, the posture of routine. The driver's posture was compliant, eager, the posture of a citizen being checked and wanting to pass. Papers were exchanged. The officer glanced at the papers. The officer waved the sedan through. The sedan accelerated. The pickup truck advanced.

The queue moved. The bus advanced. Twenty metres from the barrier.

Connor's breathing was wrong. Too fast, too shallow, the breath catching in the top of his chest rather than reaching his diaphragm, the respiratory pattern of a body in fight-or-flight that had chosen neither fight nor flight but freeze, the third option, the option that the textbooks called tonic immobility, the option that the body selected when the other two options were impossible, when the threat was too large to fight and there was nowhere to flee and the only remaining strategy was to become very, very still and hope that stillness was the same as invisibility.

He forced a breath. Deep. Slow. The breath reached his diaphragm. The diaphragm expanded. The ribcage moved. The breath was an act of will, the conscious override of an autonomous system that had malfunctioned, the mind reaching down into the body's machinery and manually operating the bellows because the bellows had stopped operating themselves.

The pickup truck was at the barrier. An officer approached. Papers. Conversation. The officer looked at the truck bed -- empty, a blue tarp folded in the corner. The officer waved the truck through. The sedan behind the truck advanced.

The sedan. Papers. Conversation. The officer was quicker with this one -- a glance at the driver, a glance at the papers, a wave. Through.

The bus advanced to the barrier.

An officer approached the driver's window. The window was at the lower deck level -- Connor, on the upper deck, could not see the conversation but could feel the bus's engine idle change as the driver slowed to a complete stop, the vibration dropping to a low, bass hum.

The conversation took thirty seconds. The driver showed papers -- the bus manifest, the company documentation, whatever papers buses showed at checkpoints. The officer looked at the papers. The officer looked at the bus -- a quick scan, the eyes moving across the windows of the lower deck, then up to the upper deck.

The officer's eyes passed across Connor's window. Connor was one of forty-four faces visible through the tinted glass, one of forty-four passengers arranged in rows, all looking ahead or at their phones or sleeping, the collective passivity of a busload of people being checked by the police and responding with the universal response to police checks, which was to be very quiet and very still and hope the check ended quickly.

The officer looked at Connor's window for less than a second. The look was not focused on Connor -- the look was the general scan of a man checking a bus, the same scan he'd performed on the previous bus and would perform on the next. Connor was a face in a window. Connor was a tourist. Connor was invisible.

The officer stepped back. He raised his hand. He waved.

The bus moved forward. The bus passed the barrier. The bus passed the cones. The bus accelerated. The checkpoint receded in the rear window -- the cones, the vehicles, the officers, the table, the van with its closed doors -- all of it shrinking, diminishing, the geometry of the checkpoint collapsing from three-dimensional reality into a memory, a thing that had happened and was now behind them.

The bus merged back into three lanes. The highway opened. The speed returned to one hundred and ten. The engine note rose. The vibration normalised.

Connor's hands were still gripping the armrests. The knuckles were still white. The tendons were still visible. His body had not received the message that the checkpoint was past, that the danger was behind them, that the cones were a kilometre back and receding. The body was still in the freeze state, still operating on the adrenaline spike that had arrived with the first sight of the orange cones, the body lagging behind the reality by the interval that the brain required to process the transition from danger to safety.

Safety. The word was wrong. The word implied that the checkpoint had been the danger and passing it had eliminated the danger. The word was wrong because the danger was not behind him. The danger was beneath him, in the luggage compartment, in the black suitcase, where it would remain for the rest of the journey. The checkpoint had been one gate. There might be another. There might be another set of cones, another set of officers, another van with closed doors that might this time have open doors and behind the open doors a dog, a German shepherd or a Belgian Malinois or whatever breed the PDRM used, a dog whose nose could detect methamphetamine through vacuum sealing and suitcase lining and the collective olfactory noise of thirty pieces of luggage in a confined space.

He released the armrests. The releasing was a deliberate act -- the mind ordering the hands to open, the hands complying, the fingers uncurling, the blood returning to the fingertips in a rush of pins and needles. He flexed his hands. The hands shook. The shaking was visible -- the tremor that had been his companion since Wei's back room had returned, amplified by the adrenaline and the fear and the specific, profound physical relief of having passed a checkpoint that he'd expected to end his life.

KM 300. KM 325.

The highway continued north. The landscape was changing -- the flat central plains giving way to the foothills that preceded the Titiwangsa Range, the mountains that formed the spine of the peninsula. The hills were green, dense, the jungle that covered them old and dark and unconcerned with the highway that cut through their foothills, unconcerned with the buses and the trucks and the cars that carried humans and their cargo and their fears through a landscape that had existed for millions of years before humans arrived and would exist for millions after they left.

Connor closed his eyes. The bus rocked gently. The air conditioning hummed. The passengers around him slept or read or stared at phones, and the bus carried them north, and the suitcase was in the dark, and the checkpoint was behind them, and the road to Penang was open.

One hour to go.

He might survive this. The thought arrived not as hope but as information, the way all his thoughts now arrived -- flat, clinical, the emotional content stripped away by the adrenaline crash that followed the spike, the body's chemical hangover, the particular exhaustion of a system that had prepared for catastrophe and received reprieve. He might survive this. He might arrive in Penang. He might deliver the suitcase. He might collect the RM10,000. He might return to KL. He might be free.

*Usually quiet on Fridays.*

The thought lasted eight seconds. Then the bus slowed again.

---

The second checkpoint was different from the first.

The first checkpoint had been a routine operation -- three officers, a barrier, the quick processing of vehicles through a single lane. The first checkpoint had been the machinery of enforcement operating at its baseline level, the minimum deployment, the perfunctory check.

The second checkpoint was not perfunctory.

Connor saw it from six hundred metres. The upper deck's elevation gave him the view. The cones were there -- orange, bright, the same as before. The police vehicles were there -- but more of them. Five. No, six. Blue and white Proton Wiras and a truck and two vans, the vans larger than the one at the first checkpoint, the vans parked perpendicular to the highway, their rear doors open.

Open.

The doors were open and behind the doors, visible even at this distance because the contrast between the dark interior and the bright daylight made the shapes inside visible, were crates. Crates and the forms of handlers. And the forms of dogs.

Connor saw the dogs and the seeing was the end of something.

The end was not dramatic -- not a scream or a collapse or the cinematic moment of a man undone by the sight of his fate. The end was quiet. The end was the cessation of the last thread of the fiction -- the fiction that he would arrive in Penang, deliver the suitcase, collect the money, return to KL, be free. The fiction that Felix's *usually* was a promise rather than a probability. The fiction that four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine could travel the North-South Expressway on a Friday morning in a bus with forty-four passengers and pass through a checkpoint with dogs without being detected.

The fiction ended. What replaced it was not panic. What replaced it was a clarity so complete and so sudden that it felt like a physical sensation -- like a light being switched on in a room that had been dark for forty-seven days, the room illuminated all at once, every corner visible, every object named, the room revealed to be exactly the shape and size that he'd been told it was by Priya and Tomoko and Mama Siti and Mei Ling and Ahmad and Razak and every person who had tried to warn him and been ignored.

The clarity said: *This is it. This is where it ends. This is the checkpoint with the dog and the dog will find what's in the suitcase and the officers will open the suitcase and the lining will be cut and the bags will be extracted and the bags will be weighed and the weight will be four hundred and fifty grams and the number will trigger Section 39B and Section 39B will trigger the mandatory death penalty and the mandatory death penalty will end your life.*

The clarity was not fear. The clarity was beyond fear. The clarity was the state that existed on the other side of fear, the state where fear had burned so hot and so long that it consumed its own fuel and what remained was the ash of fear, the grey, light, weightless residue that fear left behind when fear was finished.

The bus slowed. Two hundred metres. One hundred and fifty.

Connor could see the dogs clearly now. Two of them. German shepherds. On leashes, held by handlers in the PDRM's K-9 unit uniform. The dogs were calm -- sitting on the highway shoulder, their ears up, their posture alert but relaxed, the posture of working dogs who were waiting to work, who understood their function, who would perform their function with the mechanical reliability of animals trained to detect specific molecular compounds through layers of plastic and fabric and suitcase lining.

The bus stopped. The bus was third in the queue. Two vehicles ahead -- a sedan and a delivery truck. The sedan was being checked. An officer was speaking to the driver. Another officer was walking around the sedan with a flashlight, examining the exterior, the trunk, the wheel wells. A handler walked a dog around the sedan. The dog circled. The dog paused at the trunk. The dog moved on. The dog did not alert. The sedan was waved through.

The delivery truck. The officers approached. Papers were examined. The truck's rear doors were opened. An officer climbed in. A handler walked a dog around the truck. The dog circled. The dog showed no interest. The officer emerged from the truck's interior. The truck was waved through.

The bus was next.

Connor's phone buzzed. The burner phone. In his pocket. The vibration arrived against his thigh with the familiar, Pavlovian urgency that it always carried. He took out the phone.

Felix.

*How's the journey? Everything smooth?*

Connor stared at the message. The message was the message of a man checking on a delivery, the way a logistics manager checked on a shipment, the way a handler checked on a mule. The message was professional, casual, the tone of a man for whom this was routine, who had sent this same message to Lena and to the mules before Lena and would send it to the mules after Connor.

He didn't reply. He put the phone back in his pocket.

The bus advanced to the checkpoint. An officer approached the driver's window. The conversation began. Papers. The officer took the manifest. He looked at it. He looked at the bus.

A second officer appeared at the luggage compartment. The officer carried keys -- the universal keys that officers carried for luggage compartments, the keys that opened any bus belly regardless of company or model. The officer inserted a key. The compartment door swung open. The compartment's interior was visible -- the dark space, the rubber matting, the bags.

A handler appeared with a dog.

The dog was led to the luggage compartment. The dog lowered its nose. The dog's nostrils flared -- the incredible, evolved machinery of the canine olfactory system engaging, processing the molecular information contained in the air of a luggage compartment that held thirty pieces of luggage and the particular, distinctive chemical signature of methamphetamine.

The dog moved along the compartment. Bag by bag. Sniffing. Processing. The handler watched. The handler's grip on the leash was loose -- the grip of a man who trusted his dog, who knew that the dog's nose was more reliable than any technology, who had watched the dog detect substances through vacuum sealing and plastic wrap and the defensive chemistry of industrial-grade concealment.

Connor watched from the upper deck. He watched through the tinted window, looking down at the angle that the upper deck provided, the angle that showed the luggage compartment and the dog and the handler and the bags. He could see his suitcase. The black hard-shell. It was in the middle of the compartment, wedged between a large duffle bag and a floral-print suitcase belonging to the elderly couple across the aisle.

The dog reached the duffle bag. Sniffed. Moved on. The dog reached the floral suitcase. Sniffed. Moved on.

The dog reached the black suitcase.

The dog stopped.

The dog's body changed. The ears, already up, came forward. The tail stiffened. The nose pressed against the suitcase's surface -- the hard-shell plastic, the surface through which the molecules of methamphetamine had migrated, through the vacuum bags and the fabric lining and the polymer shell, the molecules too small to be stopped by any physical barrier but large enough to be detected by the 300 million olfactory receptors in a German shepherd's nose.

The dog sat.

The sitting was the alert. The sit was the signal. The dog sat beside the black suitcase and looked at its handler and the handler looked at the dog and the handler's face changed -- from the relaxed attention of routine work to the focused, sharpened attention of a man whose dog had found something, the attention that activated the next phase of the protocol, the phase that involved extracting the bag and opening it and examining its contents and identifying its owner and the identification leading to an arrest and the arrest leading to a charge and the charge leading to the courtroom and the courtroom leading to the sentence and the sentence leading to death.

The handler called to the officers. His voice was audible through the bus's window -- a single word, clear, the word that changed everything.

"*Positif.*"

The word entered the bus through the glass and the air conditioning and the metal and reached Connor's ears and the word was the period at the end of a sentence that had been forty-seven days in the writing, the last word of the story that had begun in a common room with a beer and a German accent and a smile.

Officers converged on the compartment. The suitcase was extracted. The suitcase was placed on the highway shoulder. The suitcase was opened -- not the main compartment but the lining, an officer producing a utility knife and cutting through the fabric with the practiced strokes of a man who had done this before, who knew where to cut, who knew what he would find.

The vacuum bags appeared. Clear plastic, sealed, the contents visible -- white crystalline substance, compressed into flat rectangles, five bags, each labelled by no one because labels were not part of the packaging process at Wei's shop. The bags were placed on the ground beside the suitcase. An officer put on gloves. An officer opened a test kit -- the small, portable narcotics identification kit that field officers carried, the kit that contained the reagent that turned blue in the presence of methamphetamine.

The reagent turned blue.

---

The bus door opened.

An officer climbed the stairs to the upper deck. He was tall -- six feet, uniformed, the peaked cap casting a shadow across his face, the shadow making his expression unreadable. He carried the bus manifest in one hand.

"Penumpang kerusi dua puluh dua B." *Passenger seat 22B.*

The upper deck was silent. The passengers had heard the commotion below -- the voices, the dog, the word *positif*. They had felt the bus not moving, had seen the officers through the windows, had registered the change in the atmosphere from routine check to something else, something that generated the specific, electric silence of a group of people witnessing an event they would tell other people about later.

"Seat 22B," the officer said again, in English. "Please come with me."

Connor stood. The standing was the last autonomous act his body would perform -- the last time his legs would lift him from a seat of his own choosing, the last time his muscles would obey the impulse to rise, to move, to participate in the vertical experience of being a person who was free to stand and sit and walk and stop as they wished. From this moment forward, the standing and the sitting and the walking and the stopping would be directed by other people, by the system, by the machinery of enforcement and incarceration and the specific, bureaucratic process that began with a dog sitting beside a suitcase and ended with a sentence delivered by a judge in a courtroom.

He reached for his daypack. The daypack contained his passport, his phone, his water, his blue towel. The officer watched him reach for it. The officer did not stop him. The daypack was not the issue. The suitcase was the issue.

He walked down the aisle. The passengers watched. Forty-three faces, turned toward him, the faces of ordinary people on an ordinary bus witnessing the extraordinary event of a man being removed by police, the event that they would describe to their families tonight -- *there was a mat salleh on the bus, they found drugs in his luggage, they took him off at the checkpoint, he was young, Australian I think, he looked scared* -- the event that would become a story and the story would be told and retold and the details would shift with each telling and the mat salleh would become taller or shorter and the drugs would become more or less and the fear on his face would become more or less visible but the core would remain: a young foreigner, a bus, a suitcase, a dog, and the Malaysian law that treated fifty grams of methamphetamine as a capital offence.

He descended the stairs. Lower deck. The door. The sunlight.

The highway. The shoulder. The cones. The officers. The suitcase, open, the lining cut, the vacuum bags on the ground, the white crystalline substance visible in the clear plastic, the test kit with its blue reagent sitting on the asphalt like a small, decisive piece of evidence that had rendered its verdict in less than a minute.

An officer approached Connor. The officer was professional, calm, the manner of a man performing a procedure he'd performed before. He spoke in English.

"Are you the owner of this suitcase?"

Connor looked at the suitcase. The suitcase looked back. The suitcase that Felix had placed on the bed in the private room. The suitcase that Connor had picked up by its telescopic handle. The suitcase that had rolled across the TBS concourse and been loaded into the luggage compartment by a handler who didn't know and didn't care. The suitcase that had been anonymous and was now the most visible object on the North-South Expressway, surrounded by officers and a dog and the chemical evidence of what it contained.

"Yes," Connor said.

The word was the admission, the confession, the legal foundation upon which everything that followed would be constructed -- the charge, the trial, the sentence. The word was *yes* and *yes* was the word that the system required, the input that activated the process, the key that turned in the lock.

The officer nodded.

"You are under arrest under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 for trafficking in dangerous drugs. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used as evidence. You have the right to legal representation."

The words were formal, recited, the words that officers said because the law required them to say them and the saying was not a courtesy but a procedure, the procedure that transformed a person from a civilian into a suspect, from a passenger into a prisoner, from a man on a bus to a man in handcuffs.

The handcuffs appeared. Steel. The officer took Connor's wrists -- gently, professionally, the wrists of a young man who was not resisting, who was standing on a highway shoulder in Perak in the eleven o'clock sun with the traffic streaming past and the other passengers watching from the bus windows and the dog sitting calmly beside the suitcase and the world continuing, the world absolutely continuing, the sky still blue and the palm oil plantations still green and the highway still carrying vehicles north and south and the world not pausing, not even for a moment, for the arrest of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had wanted nothing more than to avoid going home and had found, in a hostel on Petaling Street, a home that was a trap, and in the trap, a suitcase, and in the suitcase, the end.

The handcuffs closed around his wrists. The steel was warm from the sun. The click was small, precise, final.

Connor Briggs was under arrest.

The bus pulled away. The bus continued north, toward Penang, minus one passenger, minus one suitcase, the seat 22B empty now, the daypack gone, the space where Connor had sat returning to its neutral state, ready for the next journey, the next passenger, the next person going somewhere because they chose to.

On the highway shoulder, Connor was placed in the back of a police vehicle. The door closed. The vehicle pulled onto the highway. The vehicle turned south.

Not north, to Penang. South. Back to KL. Back to Dang Wangi.

The checkpoint receded. The cones. The officers. The dogs. The suitcase on the ground with its lining cut and its contents exposed and the blue reagent in the test kit confirming what everyone already knew.

Connor sat in the back of the police vehicle with his hands cuffed in his lap and the blue towel in his daypack and the afternoon light coming through the window and the highway unspooling behind him and the Petronas Towers somewhere ahead, growing larger as the vehicle moved south, the towers that had been his landmark for forty-seven days, the towers that had been behind Felix's silhouette on the first night, the towers that had watched from the skyline as he carried envelopes and packages and backpacks and charger boxes and now a suitcase through the streets of a city that had been beautiful and lethal and patient as stone.

The towers grew larger. The city approached. The story was nearly over.
# Chapter 32: Dang Wangi

The drive south took two hours and forty-seven minutes.

Connor knew this not because he checked a clock -- his phone was in his daypack, which was on the seat beside him, zipped, the phone inside it dark and inaccessible because his hands were cuffed and the cuffs were in his lap and the lap was the only place the cuffs allowed his hands to be, the steel links short, perhaps eight inches of chain between the bracelets, enough to rest his hands on his thighs but not enough to reach the daypack's zipper. He knew the duration because the drive had a rhythm, and the rhythm had intervals, and the intervals were marked by the things that passed the window -- the kilometre markers counting down from the checkpoint to KL, the green signs with white numbers, KM 275, KM 250, KM 225, the numbers descending the way a countdown descended, the way a life descended when it was measured not in years or months but in kilometres of highway between a checkpoint in Perak and a police station in Kuala Lumpur.

The officers did not speak to him.

There were two of them. The driver and a second officer in the passenger seat. Both in the blue uniform of the PDRM, both facing forward, both occupying the front of the vehicle with the professional silence of men who had transported arrested persons before and who understood that the transport was not a conversation but a procedure, the movement of a body from Point A to Point B, and the body's feelings and fears and the desperate, churning interior monologue that the body produced were irrelevant to the procedure, were noise in a system that operated on signal alone.

The driver drove. The passenger officer wrote in a spiral-bound notebook -- date, time, location, suspect details, arresting officer, charge. The pen scratched. The air conditioning hummed. The tyres hissed on the asphalt. The three sounds formed the acoustic environment of the vehicle, the soundtrack of transit.

Connor sat behind the mesh partition that separated the rear seat from the front. The partition was steel, painted black, the mesh fine enough to see through but too fine to reach through, the barrier that divided the vehicle into two worlds: the world of the officers, where the radio occasionally crackled and the dashboard instruments glowed green and the windshield showed the road ahead, and the world of the arrested, which was a back seat with vinyl upholstery and a door that had no interior handle and a window that did not open and the smell of disinfectant and sweat and the accumulated human residue of every person who had sat in this seat before him.

The handcuffs were not tight. This surprised him -- the surprise arriving in the clinical, detached way that all his perceptions now arrived, as data rather than emotion, as observation rather than feeling. He had expected pain, the red marks and bruising that handcuffs produced in films, the visual evidence of restraint that communicated suffering. But the cuffs were sized correctly -- the officer who had applied them had checked the fit, had ensured that two fingers could slide between the steel and the skin, the procedure performed with the competence of a man who understood that the purpose of handcuffs was restraint, not punishment, and that the distinction mattered.

The cuffs were warm -- sun-warmed, the steel absorbing the Perak midday heat -- and they had stayed warm against his skin, reaching thermal equilibrium, the cuffs becoming the temperature of the man wearing them, becoming, in a physical sense, part of him.

He watched the landscape in reverse.

The foothills of the Titiwangsa Range, which he had watched approach through the bus window two hours ago, were now receding behind him. The green hills with their dark jungle canopy were shrinking in the rear window, the mountains returning to the distance they had occupied when he'd been travelling north, the landscape rewinding, the geography undoing itself, the journey replaying backward like a film run in reverse -- the same palm oil plantations, the same kampungs on stilts above the rice paddies, the same rest stop at Tapah visible for a moment through the window as the police vehicle passed the service area where he had eaten a pandan kuih and thanked an elderly woman and been, for thirty seconds, a normal person doing a normal thing in a normal place on a normal day.

The rest stop disappeared. The highway continued south. The landscape flattened -- the foothills giving way to the alluvial plain that surrounded KL, the low ground at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers, the land that had been tin mines and jungle before the British arrived and decided it would be a city, the land that was now eight million people and a skyline and a police force and a legal system and a cell that was waiting for him at the end of this drive.

KM 200. KM 175. KM 150.

The numbers descended. The city approached. And somewhere between KM 200 and KM 150, Connor saw the Petronas Towers.

They appeared through the windshield -- not through his window, which faced east, but through the front windshield, visible through the mesh partition, visible between the heads of the two officers, visible in the distance as two silver points against the haze of the KL skyline. The towers were small at first, the size of pins, the size of the towers as seen from the rooftop of the Lantern Hostel on the night Felix had stood against the railing and said *I could use someone reliable around here*. Then larger. The size of fingers. The size of the towers as seen from the bus window when KL had receded behind him this morning, a lifetime ago, when he had been a man on a bus going north and the towers had been behind him and shrinking.

Now the towers were ahead of him and growing.

The towers grew and the growing was the visual measure of his return to the city, the reverse odometer, the geometric proof that the distance between Connor Briggs and Kuala Lumpur was closing at one hundred and ten kilometres per hour. The towers grew from pins to fingers to the full, unmistakable profile of the Petronas Twin Towers -- silver, twin, connected by the skybridge at the forty-first floor, the icon, the landmark.

He had photographed them forty-five days ago. The photograph was still on his Instagram. @ConnorGoesGlobal. *These two beauties tho. KL is UNREAL.* The photograph showed the towers at night, silver against blue. Forty-seven likes. The photograph was the artefact of a person who no longer existed, the digital fossil of Connor Briggs the backpacker, Connor Briggs the man who had looked at the towers and seen content rather than context, who had seen an Instagram post rather than a city, who had seen a caption rather than a country with a legal system that would kill him for what was in the suitcase -- opened now on the highway shoulder in Perak, the lining cut, the vacuum bags exposed, the evidence that would be weighed and tested and entered into a file bearing his name and the section of the act he had violated, Section 39B, the section that began with *trafficking* and ended with *death*.

The towers continued to grow. KM 125. KM 100. KM 75.

The suburbs began. The highway was no longer cutting through plantation and jungle but through the metropolitan periphery of KL -- apartment blocks, housing estates, the geometric sprawl of a city that grew outward as well as upward, the residential rings surrounding the commercial core like the growth rings of a tree, each ring connected to the centre by the highway that was carrying him back into the city's heart.

Traffic thickened. The police vehicle slowed into the stop-start pattern of KL's highways during midday -- not the full gridlock of rush hour but the congested flow of a city with too many vehicles and not enough road, the traffic that KL's residents accepted the way they accepted humidity, as a permanent condition. The radio crackled occasionally -- a dispatcher's voice, Malay, call signs and codes. The driver responded once, briefly, three words. Connor did not understand them.

He did not ask where they were taking him. He knew. He had not been told -- the officers had not told him anything, had not announced a destination, had not narrated the journey the way journeys were narrated in police procedurals, with the detective in the front seat explaining the situation to the suspect in the back. The officers had said nothing. But Connor knew. The arrest had occurred in Perak, on the highway, at a checkpoint operated by the federal police. But the charge -- trafficking, Section 39B, the Dangerous Drugs Act -- was a matter for the narcotics division, and the narcotics division operated out of district headquarters, and the district headquarters for the area that included Petaling Street and Chinatown and the Lantern Hostel was Dang Wangi.

Dang Wangi.

The name had entered Connor's life on Day 23. Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters. The business card that Ahmad had handed him during the random street check on Bukit Bintang, the card that Connor had put in his wallet and then transferred to the pocket of his board shorts and then memorised without meaning to, the eleven digits becoming embedded in his memory the way song lyrics embedded themselves, through repetition and emotional association, the number becoming not just a sequence of digits but a talisman, a key, a line of communication to the one man in the system who had looked at Connor and seen not a tourist but a person in danger.

+60 3 2600 ####.

He had called that number twice. The first time, five rings to voicemail, nineteen seconds of silence on the recording, the message he couldn't leave, the words that wouldn't form. The second time, Ahmad's voice, live, the line open, three seconds of connection, three seconds in which the words could have come but didn't, the call ended by his own thumb on the red button, the thumb that had sealed his own fate with a gesture as small as ending a phone call.

And now he was being driven to Ahmad's station. In handcuffs. In the back of a police vehicle. With four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine attributed to his name and his passport number and the suitcase that was evidence and the evidence that was a death sentence and the death sentence that was the law of the country he was in, the law that he had been told about and warned about and shown and explained and printed out and handed to him, by Ahmad, by Razak, by Priya, by the warnings in the airport, by the warnings on the television, by the warnings that were everywhere in a country that believed that the warnings mattered, and he had refused, every time, with the machine's efficiency, the machine converting every warning into noise, every signal into static, every *you will die if you do this* into *relax, it's Asia*.

The irony was not lost on him. The irony was, in fact, the dominant feature of the drive -- more present than the landscape, more visible than the towers, more audible than the radio. The irony was the air in the vehicle, the substance that filled the space between the mesh partition and the rear window. The irony of arriving at the station where Ahmad worked, the station he could have walked into voluntarily at any point in the last twenty-four days, the station that Razak had told him to go to at seven AM, the station that had been twelve minutes by foot from the Lantern Hostel, twelve minutes that might have saved his life if he had walked them this morning instead of climbing the staircase to Felix's room and picking up the suitcase and riding a Grab to TBS and boarding a bus and sitting in seat 22B and watching a dog sit beside his suitcase on a highway in Perak.

Twelve minutes. The walk to Dang Wangi was twelve minutes. He had measured it once, on Day 23, after Ahmad had given him the card, standing on Petaling Street with his phone in his hand and using Google Maps to calculate the distance from the hostel's front door to the police headquarters' main entrance, the blue dot on the map and the red pin on the map and the line between them and the number beneath the line: 1.1 kilometres, eleven hundred metres, the distance a fit person could walk in twelve minutes, the distance that separated the Lantern Hostel from the office of the one man in the system who might have been able to intercede.

He had not walked those twelve minutes. He had driven four hundred kilometres in the opposite direction and was now driving four hundred kilometres back, and the net distance between himself and Dang Wangi was the same -- he was going to end up at the station regardless, was going to pass through the same doors, was going to be in the same building -- but the terms had changed. The walk would have made him a witness, a cooperator, a man who had come in voluntarily with information, and the drive was making him a suspect, a defendant, a man who had been arrested on a highway with enough methamphetamine to trigger the mandatory death penalty.

The terms. The language. The categories. The system had boxes. Witness. Suspect. Defendant. Convicted. Sentenced. You went into one box and the lid closed and the next box opened and you went in and the lid closed and the lids only closed one way. The word for one-way lids was *irreversible* and the word was a word Priya would have used and Priya was on a plane and the word was his now, the only thing she'd left him that was useful. And the category Connor was entering -- suspect, arrested, charged under Section 39B -- was a category from which the exits were limited and the most probable exit was not an exit at all but a terminus, a dead end, the end of the corridor, the last door that did not open from the inside.

KM 50. KM 25.

The city was here. The highway had become an elevated road, raised above the streets on concrete pillars, the view from the window now KL from above -- the rooftops of shophouses, the minarets of mosques, construction cranes standing like steel birds above building sites, the smoke from hawker stalls, the heat shimmer rising from asphalt, eight million people doing eight million things on a Friday afternoon.

The vehicle descended from the elevated road. Surface streets. Traffic lights. The geography becoming recognisable -- Jalan Tun Perak, the road that ran east-west through the city centre, the road Connor had walked on a dozen times. The vehicle turned. Jalan Dang Wangi. The street that shared its name with the police station that shared its name with the district.

The police station appeared.

Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters was a building that announced its function through architecture. Concrete and glass, institutional, modern in the way that government buildings were modern -- clean lines without elegance, functional surfaces without warmth, the aesthetic of efficiency applied to architecture with the result that the building looked exactly like what it was: a place where the machinery of law enforcement operated twenty-four hours a day, the building never dark, never empty, the lights always on because the work was never done.

The vehicle pulled into the rear entrance. A steel gate, painted grey, operated by a guard in a booth. The guard looked at the driver. The driver showed credentials. The gate opened. The vehicle entered an underground parking area -- concrete, lit by tubes overhead, the blue-white light of buildings where human beings were processed rather than welcomed.

The vehicle stopped. The engine died. The underground space had its own acoustic signature: the hum of ventilation, the echo of footsteps on concrete, the distant clang of a door, the drip of water from a pipe overhead. The sounds were hollow, reverberant, the raw sound of a building's infrastructure.

The officer in the passenger seat got out. He opened Connor's door -- the door that had no interior handle, the door that was the physical expression of custody, that opened only from outside.

"Keluar." *Get out.*

Connor got out. The movement was awkward -- the handcuffs restricted his arm movement, the chain catching on his thighs as he slid across the vinyl seat, his centre of gravity off because his hands couldn't brace against the doorframe, the body performing a simple action with the clumsy, degraded competence of a body whose primary tools were bound together.

He stood in the parking area. The concrete floor was cool through his Birkenstocks. The officers flanked him, one on each side, not touching him, the professional distance of escort -- close enough to intervene if the suspect ran, far enough to convey that the escort was procedure, not aggression. They walked to a door -- steel, painted grey, a keycard reader beside it. The driver swiped a card. The reader beeped. The door opened.

A corridor. The corridor was what corridors were in police stations: long, narrow, the light overhead a constant blue-white buzz, the walls painted a colour that might have been cream or might have been grey or might have been the colour that resulted from applying cream paint to grey walls and allowing twenty years of institutional use to blend the two into a third colour that existed only in government buildings, the colour of administration, the colour of function.

The corridor smelled of disinfectant -- commercial-grade, pine-scented, the scent designed to convey cleanliness rather than achieve it. Beneath the disinfectant, other smells: old sweat, coffee, and something fainter, something that Connor's body recognised before his mind could name it -- a tightening in the chest, a quickening of the pulse. The smell of a place where people were held. The smell of walls that had been breathed against by hundreds of people in handcuffs, the collective exhalation of fear and boredom absorbed by the paint and the concrete and released, slowly, into the corridor's air.

They walked past closed doors on both sides -- INTERVIEW ROOM 1, INTERVIEW ROOM 2, EVIDENCE STORAGE, ADMINISTRATION. Behind the doors, the muffled sounds of work: voices, keyboards, the ring of a phone. The sounds of a system that did not pause for the arrival of a new suspect because new suspects arrived constantly and the system's capacity to absorb them was the system's defining feature.

At the end of the corridor, a counter. High -- chest height, the kind of counter designed to separate the people behind it from the people in front of it, the architectural expression of a power differential, the counter that said *we are here* and *you are there* and the distance between here and there was not measured in metres but in authority. Behind it, a woman -- middle-aged, uniformed, seated at a computer that looked like it had been built in 2008 and had been performing the same function ever since. She looked up when Connor arrived. Her expression did not change. The expression of a person who processed arrivals the way a toll booth operator processed vehicles -- one at a time, in order, without commentary.

The escorting officer spoke to her in Malay. The conversation was brief, procedural -- name, charge, arresting location, time. The woman typed. The keyboard clattered with the old, mechanical rhythm of a woman who had typed thousands of bookings, the rhythm that turned the facts of Connor's arrest into data, into a file, into a case number.

The case number appeared on the screen. Connor couldn't see the screen -- the counter was too high, the screen angled toward the officer -- but the woman read it aloud to the escorting officer.

"DDW dash 2026 dash 04783."

DDW: Dang Wangi. 2026: the year. 04783: the four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-third case processed by this station in 2026. Connor was a number. The number was the system's name for him, the name that would appear on every document, every report, every court filing, every piece of paper that the system generated in the process of converting Connor James Briggs from a person into a case.

04783. He was the four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-third. The number was precise, indifferent, the counting of a system that counted everyone and treated the counting as the essential act, the act that brought the person into the system's awareness, the act that made the person real in the system's terms. Four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-two people had been processed before him in 2026 alone. Four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-two arrivals at this counter, this keyboard, this screen, this woman's hands.

---

Processing took one hour and fourteen minutes.

The processing was performed in a room adjacent to the booking counter -- a room designed for exactly this purpose, containing the tools and equipment required to record a person's physical and biographical details with the thoroughness that the law required. A desk, two chairs, a computer, a fingerprint scanner, a camera mounted on a tripod, a height chart painted on the wall, and the particular atmosphere of a room where thousands of people had been photographed and fingerprinted and measured and documented, the room's walls absorbing the repetition of the process the way the corridor's walls absorbed the smell of fear.

Fingerprinting came first.

A technician appeared -- not one of the escorting officers but a civilian employee, a young Malay man in a polo shirt and slacks, the uniform of a person who worked for the police without being police. His movements were automatic, practised -- the movements of a man who had fingerprinted hundreds of people and for whom the process was not dramatic but routine.

Connor's handcuffs were removed. The escorting officer produced a small universal key and turned it in the lock and the bracelets opened, right then left. The sensation was nothing. He had expected relief, the physical pleasure of unrestraint. But the cuffs had not been painful, and the removal of something that was not painful did not produce relief -- only the next condition, uncuffed hands in a room where the hands were uncuffed because the fingerprinting required flat, open palms.

The technician took Connor's right hand. The grip was firm but not aggressive, functional, existing only to position the hand correctly on the scanner's glass surface.

The scanner was electronic -- a flat glass plate connected to the computer, the technology that had replaced ink pads and paper cards with digital capture and algorithmic matching. Connor's fingers were pressed to the glass one at a time -- right thumb, right index, right middle, right ring, right little, then the left hand in the same sequence. Each finger held for three seconds while the scanner captured the print, the ridges and whorls digitised and stored, the unique pattern that had been left on every surface he had ever touched -- doorknobs and coffee cups and phone screens and the telescopic handle of a black hard-shell suitcase. Then palm prints. Then the edges of the hands, the surfaces the technician was thorough about because thoroughness was the standard and the standard did not vary.

The technician did not speak except to give instructions: "Right hand. Index finger. Press. Hold." The instructions were in English, simple, the reduced vocabulary of a process that required compliance rather than conversation. Connor complied. The compliance was automatic, the body performing the requested actions without the mind's engagement.

Photographing followed.

The camera was digital, mounted on a tripod at a fixed distance from the height chart on the wall. Connor was positioned against the chart. 185 centimetres. Six foot one.

"Face forward. No expression."

The instruction was unnecessary -- his face had no expression to suppress. His face was the face from the service area mirror at Tapah: thin, grey under the sunburn, the eyes bloodshot, the mouth a line. The face of a man who had been awake for thirty-two hours and had spent the last three in the back of a police vehicle watching the landscape of his freedom replay in reverse. The face was not performing an expression. The face was displaying its condition, which was the condition of a system that had exhausted its emotional inventory and was operating on the residual charge of biological processes that did not require emotional input -- breathing, standing, blinking, the autonomic functions that kept the body upright while the mind processed the incomprehensible.

The camera fired. Flash. The white light was sudden, total, filling the room for a fraction of a second. The photograph that would be attached to case file DDW-2026-04783, the photograph in which he was not @ConnorGoesGlobal and not a digital nomad and not a content creator but a suspect, a body, a face against a height chart, a data point in a system.

"Turn left."

He turned left. The camera fired. The profile -- the jawline, the stubble, the sun-bleached hair that was no longer a man-bun but loose, hanging to his shoulders, the hair that Priya had touched on the air well bench.

"Turn right." He turned right. The camera fired.

"Face forward again." One more photograph. Four images: front, left profile, right profile, front again. The four angles that the system required to document a face.

Personal details were recorded next. The woman behind the counter had begun the process; now it was completed in the processing room by the escorting officer, who sat across the desk from Connor with a form -- paper, actual paper, the form printed on the kind of institutional paper that government departments used, slightly thicker than printer paper and slightly thinner than card stock, designed to survive filing, the paper that would exist in a folder in a cabinet for decades.

The questions were procedural.

"Full name."
"Connor James Briggs."

"Date of birth."
"Fourteenth of March, 1999."

"Nationality."
"Australian."

"Passport number."
"PA7834521."

"Address in Malaysia."
A pause. The question required an answer and the answer was the address of a building that had been his home for forty-seven days and was no longer his home and was, in fact, one of the nodes in the network that had produced his arrest, the building where Felix had recruited him and the suitcase had been waiting.

"The Lantern Hostel. Twenty-eight Jalan Petaling. Kuala Lumpur."

The officer wrote. The pen scratched. The address joined the other details on the form -- the biographical facts in the language of the system, the language of nouns and numbers and the absence of adjectives, the language that did not care whether the man across the desk was arrogant or frightened or twenty-seven, the language that cared only about the fields on the form and the entries that filled them.

"Occupation."
"Self-employed. Freelance... social media."

The officer wrote. His expression did not change. And somewhere in his mind the old voice -- the vlog narrator, the caption machine -- observed that the form had no field for *arrogant ignorance* and no checkbox for *fatal flaw*, and the observation was the machine's ghost, the last flicker of a system that was already dead.

*She'll be right.* The thought arrived from the old world, from the machine's warehouse of stock phrases, and it had nothing to offer the present tense. It sat in his mind like a tourist in a courtroom, out of place, unequipped, ridiculous.

"Next of kin."
The words arrived and detonated. *Who should we call to tell them you've been arrested for a capital offence in Malaysia.*

"David and Karen Briggs. Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia."

He said his parents' names in a police processing room at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, and the saying was the first time the two worlds -- the world of his parents and the world of his arrest -- had intersected in speech, the names of his parents entering the file alongside the case number and the charge and the section of the act that described what would happen to their son.

His mother's face appeared in his mind. Not the face he saw on FaceTime calls -- the GP's face, professional and warm and slightly tilted to compensate for the laptop's angle. The other face. The face she made when she was worried, which was the face with the crease between her eyebrows and the compression of her lips and the eyes that went dark with the specific darkness of a mother who sensed that her child was in danger. The face she had made when he'd broken his arm at thirteen, falling off a skateboard at the Hawthorn velodrome. The face she would make when the phone rang at 3 AM Melbourne time and a voice said: *Mrs. Briggs, I'm calling from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. It's about your son.*

He looked at the desk. The form. The pen. The officer's hand, writing. The details of his life reduced to fields and entries, the data that the system extracted from a person the way a machine extracted ore from rock -- the useful material separated from the surrounding substance, the substance discarded, the ore processed.

The handcuffs were reapplied. The same cuffs, the same wrists, the same steel. The click was the same -- small, precise, final. But this application was not the highway-shoulder application, in the open air under the Perak sun. This application was inside, in a room with the tube's blue-white glare and no windows and the form on the desk with his parents' names on it. The system's application, the one that said: *you are now inside the machine and the machine operates on its own schedule*.

---

His belongings were catalogued.

A plastic bag -- clear, large, the kind used by police departments worldwide for the storage of personal effects, the kind that had a white label on the front for the suspect's name and case number and the date and the officer responsible. The bag was placed on the desk. The escorting officer opened Connor's daypack -- the black daypack that he had carried through twelve countries, the daypack that contained the compressed inventory of a backpacker's daily life -- and began removing items, placing each on the desk, recording each on a separate form. The property inventory. The document that listed everything a person had on them at the time of their arrest, the document that was both inventory and evidence, both storage record and exhibit list.

The items appeared on the desk in the order they were extracted from the daypack -- the order random, determined by packing arrangement, but readable, retroactively, as a small archaeology of Connor's last morning as a free person:

One passport, Australian, issued 2022, expiring 2032. The officer opened it, checked the photo against Connor's face -- the photo three years old, the face younger, fuller, the hair shorter, the expression the neutral half-smile that passport photos required, the face of a man who could not have imagined that the passport's next stamp would be applied not by an immigration officer at an airport but by a custody officer at a police station.

One mobile phone, iPhone 14, black case, 12% battery. The phone was dark, the screen locked, the last communication a text from Felix that Connor had not replied to. The phone contained Connor's life -- his contacts, his photographs, his messages to Priya and his mother. It also contained the call log with the two calls to Ahmad's number, the evidence that Connor had tried to contact a narcotics officer and failed, the data that might, in a courtroom, distinguish the mule from the handler, the victim from the perpetrator.

One mobile phone, Nokia, silver, prepaid. The burner. The officer looked at it. The officer looked at Connor. His expression shifted -- not dramatically, but a recalibration, the recognition that a young tourist carrying two phones was not a standard configuration, that the second phone told a story the first phone didn't, the story of a person who was either an operative or a tool. He placed the burner beside the iPhone. Two phones. Two lives. Evidence.

One wallet, brown leather, worn. Contents: RM347 in cash, an Australian driver's licence (expired), two credit cards (one maxed, one inactive), a Lantern Hostel loyalty card (three stamps), a Rapid KL transit card, and a business card -- white, small, printed text:

*Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail*
*Narcotics Division*
*Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters*
*+60 3 2600 ####*

The officer extracted the business card and held it. He looked at it for four seconds, which was longer than any look he had given any other item. Then he looked at Connor. The card was data. The card was a connection between the suspect and a narcotics officer at this station -- the same station where the suspect was being processed -- the connection raising questions that the officer's expression acknowledged but did not voice. The questions of when and how and why a tourist arrested for trafficking had the business card of a narcotics sergeant in his wallet, the questions that the card posed and that the card could not answer and that the system would eventually extract from Connor himself, in an interview room, with a recorder running, the questions that would determine whether the card was evidence of cooperation attempted or evidence of corruption discovered.

The officer placed the card on the desk. He recorded it on the inventory form. The card joined the other items -- the passport, the phones, the wallet, the cash -- in the record of Connor's possessions at the time of arrest.

One water bottle, plastic, half-full. Recorded. Placed in the bag.

One phone charger, genuine. Not a charger box from Wei's shop, not a hollow shell containing methamphetamine, but an actual phone charger, the real one, the charger that charged phones and nothing else. The officer examined it with care -- turning it in his hands, checking the seams, the weight, the heft that distinguished a genuine charger from the weighted replicas that the narcotics division had been finding in hostels for years. The officer was satisfied. The charger was recorded, placed in the bag.

One packet of Mamee noodle snacks, opened, half-eaten. The remnant of the service area at Tapah, the last thing Connor had eaten as a free person, the dry noodles that had tasted like nothing because his mouth had already been dry with the taste of dread. Recorded. Placed in the bag.

One blue Sea to Summit microfibre travel towel. Folded in the compact square that Connor always used, the fold that turned the rectangular towel into a square that fit in a daypack side pocket. The towel was blue -- the specific blue of the Sea to Summit brand, the blue that was not navy and not royal and not sky but the blue of travel, the blue of hostels. The companion of twelve countries. The lightest thing in the daypack and the heaviest thing in Connor's life.

The officer recorded it on the inventory form. He placed it with the other items.

Then -- a deviation.

The door opened. A guard entered -- not one of the escorting officers but a different man, uniformed, the uniform of a custody officer rather than a patrol officer, the distinction visible in the lack of equipment on the belt, the custody officer carrying keys rather than weapons. He was Malay, middle-aged. He looked at the items on the desk. He looked at the blue towel. He picked it up.

"Ini untuk dia." *This is for him.*

The officer behind the desk looked up. The look was brief -- an exchange between two men in the system, a communication that operated in the coded language of procedure and precedent and the understood shortcuts of a building where everyone knew the protocols and the deviations from the protocols.

The officer nodded. The nod authorised the deviation.

The guard took the towel. It was not placed in the plastic bag with the other items. It was held separately, carried by the guard, taken out of the inventory process and into a different process, a process that the inventory form would not record, a process that the system would later claim did not happen.

The plastic bag was sealed. The label was completed in black marker: BRIGGS, CONNOR JAMES. DDW-2026-04783. The date. The officer's signature. The bag contained the passport, the phones, the wallet, the charger, the water bottle, the noodles. The bag did not contain the towel. The bag was placed in a locker behind the counter -- a metal locker, one of a row of identical lockers, each containing the sealed bag of a processed suspect, each bag a compressed life, a person reduced to items. The locker was closed. The key was turned.

Connor watched the towel leave the room in the guard's hands. He did not question it. He did not say: *that should be in the bag*. He did not say: *the protocol requires that all personal items be catalogued and stored together*. He did not say anything because he did not know the protocol and because the towel leaving the room was, in the hierarchy of things happening to him, so far below the arrest and the charge and the mandatory death penalty and the case number and the mugshot and his parents' names on the form that the towel's disposition was invisible, a detail lost in the avalanche of details, a leaf in a flood.

But the towel was not a detail. The towel was not a leaf. The towel was the instrument of his death, and the guard who carried it knew this, and the officer who nodded knew this, and somewhere in the system -- above the guard and above the officer and above the station and the district and the division -- someone had given an order, and the order had travelled through the network the way orders travel through networks, through intermediaries and coded language and the understood channels of a system that was not one system but two, the official system that processed suspects according to law and the unofficial system that processed problems according to necessity, and the necessity, in this case, was the silencing of a mule who knew names and faces and locations and who would, given time and fear and the pressure of a capital charge, tell everything to anyone who would listen.

The towel left the room. The towel was gone. The towel would return.

---

The cell was at the end of a different corridor -- deeper in the building, below the ground floor, the corridor that led to the holding cells, the cells where suspects were kept in the hours and days between arrest and arraignment. The corridor was narrower than the one above, the walls closer, the ceiling lower, the fluorescent tubes producing a different quality of light: not illumination but surveillance, the light designed not to help people see but to ensure that people could be seen, the light that served the watchers rather than the watched.

Steel doors with small reinforced windows lined one side -- the windows at eye level, allowing guards to look in without opening the door. Connor did not look through them as he passed.

The guard stopped at the last door. Steel, painted cream-grey, the paint chipped at the edges where the door had been opened and closed thousands of times, silver crescents of bare metal showing at the handle and the frame. The door had a number: C-7.

Bed 7. Cell 7. The numbers recurring with the insistence of a motif.

The guard unlocked the door. The key was large -- not the small universal handcuff key but a proper cell key, attached to a ring attached to a chain attached to the guard's belt, the key that was always on the guard the way the handcuffs were always on the prisoner, the complementary accessories of a system built on the binary of lock and key, held and holder.

The lock turned. The door opened inward, revealing the cell in stages: grey concrete floor, grey concrete walls, a fluorescent tube mounted in a wire cage on the ceiling, the light always on because the protocol did not distinguish between day and night, did not care that the human body required darkness for sleep, cared only that the guard could look through the window at any hour and see the contents of the cell.

Three metres by three metres. Nine square metres. The size of a space that was not designed for habitation but for holding -- habitation implied comfort, holding implied temporary containment.

A steel bench bolted to the wall -- the cell's only furniture, the bed, the chair, the table, the surface that served all purposes because it was the only surface. The steel was cold, conducting the building's subterranean coolness, the constant fifteen or sixteen degrees that existed beneath the earth's surface regardless of the tropical heat above.

The front wall was not a wall but bars -- steel, vertical, painted institutional green, the green that was chosen because green was considered calming and calming was considered useful in a setting where the occupants were not calm. The bars were spaced ten centimetres apart, permeable to everything except the human body.

A squat toilet in the corner. Stainless steel, floor-mounted, no seat, no lid, no privacy, visible from the corridor through the bars.

No window. The cell had no window. The walls were solid on three sides and bars on the fourth and none contained an opening to the outside. The cell existed in the building's interior, and the outside -- sky, air, city, weather, the sun's position that indicated the time of day -- was absent, removed with the totality that only architecture could achieve.

The fluorescent tube buzzed. Not a hum but a buzz -- the sound of electricity struggling through an aging ballast, the sound of a system degrading. The buzz filled the cell, the cell's dominant sound, the ambient frequency of the space. Through the bars, faintly, the distant sounds of the station: a door closing, a voice speaking Malay, the ring of a telephone. But these sounds arrived diminished, muted, the outside world present but reduced.

The buzz was everything. The buzz was the cell.

The guard removed Connor's handcuffs. The same key, the same procedure, the same absence of sensation at the removal. Connor's wrists were free. The wrists bore faint marks -- not bruises, not the red welts of tight cuffs, but the pale indentations of steel that had rested against skin for three hours, the temporary impressions that would fade in an hour but that were, for now, the physical evidence of the drive, the marks that said: *these wrists were held*.

"Masuk." *Go in.*

Connor entered the cell. The step across the threshold was the step from the corridor into the cell, from the space of transit to the space of containment, from the space where movement was possible -- escorted, directed, controlled, but possible -- to the space where movement was limited to nine square metres and the four actions that nine square metres permitted: sitting, standing, lying, and pacing, the four activities that would constitute Connor's physical existence for as long as the system kept him here.

The guard held out the towel.

The blue towel. The Sea to Summit microfibre towel that had been extracted from the inventory process and carried down the corridor to this cell. The towel that should have been in the plastic bag in the locker with the passport and the phones. The towel that was here, in the guard's hands, being offered like a hotel amenity placed on the bed by housekeeping for the comfort of the guest.

"For comfort," the guard said. The English was accented, the phrase rehearsed, the words said with the particular intonation of a man delivering a line he'd been told to deliver, the words originating somewhere above the guard in the hierarchy, somewhere in the system that had decided Connor Briggs should have his towel in his cell and that its presence should be framed as a kindness.

Connor took the towel. The taking was automatic -- hands closing on the microfibre with the muscle memory of four years of picking up this towel in hostels and bathrooms and beaches, the hands that knew this towel better than they knew any other object in the world.

The guard stepped back. The door closed. The lock turned. The key withdrew.

Connor was alone.

---

He stood in the centre of the cell for a long time.

The standing was not a decision -- the standing was the default, the condition the body adopted when no other condition was selected, the body remaining upright because upright was where it had been when the door closed and the door closing had not included an instruction to sit or lie down. He stood and the fluorescent tube buzzed and the cell was nine square metres and the towel was in his hands and the door was locked and the bars were green and the walls were grey and the light was on and the light would not turn off, the artificial white that said: *you are inside now, and inside has its own light, and the light does not set*.

He sat on the bench. The steel was cold. The cold penetrated his board shorts and reached his skin and the skin contracted, the goosebumps forming on his thighs, the body's mechanical response to temperature, the response that was independent of fear and grief and the crushing, tidal weight of what had happened and was happening and would happen. He sat and the cold was there and the cold was the bench's only quality, the bench having no other quality to offer, the bench being steel and flat and cold and bolted to the wall and the floor with the permanence of something that had been there before Connor arrived and would be there after he left and had been there for every occupant of Cell C-7 since the cell had been built.

He looked at the walls. The walls were close. Three metres was not far. Three metres was the distance from the bench to the bars, the distance from the bench to the opposite wall, the distance that the cell permitted in any direction. Three metres was six paces for a man of Connor's height. Six paces forward, six paces back. The pacing that prisoners did, the back-and-forth that was not exercise but the body's rebellion against stillness, the body's insistence that it was designed for movement, for the open passage through space that characterised freedom.

He did not pace. He sat. The sitting was the acceptance of the space, the body adapting to the cell the way water adapted to a container, assuming the shape of its confinement, filling the available volume without resistance. The body adapted. The mind did not.

The mind was still on the highway. Still in seat 22B, watching the dog sit beside the suitcase, the handler saying *positif*, the word dividing his life into two periods: the before in which anything was possible and the after in which only one thing was possible, which was this -- a bench in a cell in Kuala Lumpur with a blue towel in his hands.

Time passed. He did not know how much. The cell had no clock, no window. Only the fluorescent tube, which produced the same light at all hours, the light that was the same at noon as at midnight, erasing time by refusing to acknowledge it, creating a permanent, buzzing present.

The sounds of the station reached him through the bars. The sounds were the sounds of a building operating: doors, voices, footsteps, the occasional ring of a telephone, the distant drone of traffic from the street above. The sounds were the sounds of the world continuing, the world that existed outside the cell and outside the building, the world where people walked and drove and ate and talked and did the things that people did when they were free to do things. The world that Connor had occupied this morning and would never occupy again in the same way, the world that had been his and was now theirs, the world belonging to the people who were not in cells.

And then, from somewhere above, from somewhere outside the building, through the concrete and the steel and the institutional architecture, through the bars and the corridor and the walls of Cell C-7, a sound arrived that was different from the station's sounds.

The call to prayer.

The adhan. The muezzin's voice from a nearby mosque -- perhaps Masjid Jamek, the mosque whose call Connor had heard every morning from Bed 7, the call that entered the Lantern Hostel through the air well at 5:32 AM, the call he had slept through and complained about and eventually stopped hearing, the way a person stopped hearing a sound that was constant.

But this was not the morning call. This was the Asr prayer, the afternoon prayer, the third of the five daily prayers, and the call was the only temporal information the cell had provided -- the muezzin's voice serving as a clock that the cell itself refused to be. A temporal anchor, a fixed point in the day's chronology, the sound that said: *it is this time, you are in this hour, the day has reached this point and will continue to the next*.

The Arabic syllables, ancient and melodic, filled the nine square metres with a sound larger than the space, a sound designed for open air and minarets now compressed into a concrete cell, the muezzin's voice arriving filtered, changed, carrying the imprint of every surface it had passed through to reach Connor's ears.

The call ended. The buzz returned. The cell's permanent condition.

---

Footsteps in the corridor.

Connor looked up. Through the bars, visible in the corridor's blue-white light, a figure approached. An officer -- different from the guard, different from the escorting officers, a new figure, uniformed, carrying a clipboard. The clipboard was the accessory of a man who moved between cells delivering information, a man whose function was to notify and not to converse, to inform and not to discuss, to deposit the system's decisions at the bars of each cell and then to move to the next cell and the next decision.

The officer stopped at the bars. He looked at Connor through the green steel. The look was professional, the look of a man performing a duty that the schedule required.

"Your embassy will be notified. Tomorrow."

The words were in English. The words were a statement, not a conversation. Information delivered in the format of the system -- declarative, temporal, the what and the when, the content and the schedule.

"Tomorrow?" Connor said. The word came out raw, the voice unused since the processing room, the vocal cords producing it with the rough sound of a voice that had been silent for hours. "Can I -- I need to call -- my embassy. The Australian High Commission. I need to --"

"Tomorrow."

The word was the same word. The same syllables, the same stress, the same intonation. The word was not a denial -- the word was a schedule. The schedule said tomorrow. The schedule did not say now. The schedule did not accommodate urgency or fear or the desperate need of a man in a cell to hear the voice of someone who represented the country on his passport, the country that was thirty-seven hundred miles away and that was, in the hierarchy of Connor's hopes, the last hope, the institutional hope, the hope that a government office in a foreign city could intervene in the legal system of another foreign city and produce a different outcome.

"A lawyer. I need a lawyer. I have the right to --"

"Tomorrow."

The officer's expression did not change. The expression was the expression of a man delivering a schedule, and the schedule was the schedule, and the schedule did not change because the suspect repeated his request, because repetition was not a variable that the schedule responded to. The schedule responded only to time, and time moved at its own pace, and its pace was not Connor's pace.

The officer left. The footsteps receded down the corridor. The corridor door opened and closed. The sound of closing was the sound of separation, the sound of the distance between inside and outside increasing by the thickness of a door, the sound that said: *you are here and the world is there and the door is between you*.

Tomorrow. The embassy tomorrow. The lawyer tomorrow. Everything tomorrow.

Connor sat on the bench. The steel was still cold. The cold was permanent, the cold of a metal that conducted heat away from the body faster than the body could produce it, the cold that would not warm because the steel's thermal mass was greater than the body's thermal output, the steel always winning, the steel always cold.

He looked at the towel in his hands. The towel was blue. The towel was familiar. The towel was the one thing in the cell that was his, that had been his before the cell and before the arrest and before the suitcase and before Felix and before the Lantern Hostel, the one thing that predated the story, the one thing that belonged to the life before.

He unfolded the towel. The compact square became a rectangle, approximately sixty centimetres by one hundred and twenty centimetres, the size designed to dry a body without occupying excessive space in a pack, the size large enough to wrap around shoulders, around waists, in hostels and on beaches and in the life that towels belonged to.

He brought the towel to his face.

The smell hit him and the smell was the past.

Sunscreen. The specific, chemical-sweet smell of SPF 50, the Australian-brand sunscreen his mother had shipped him in a care package six months ago, the sunscreen absorbed by the towel's microfibre over weeks of use, the smell that was simultaneously protection and her worry, the worry that could be addressed by sending sunscreen but not by sending sense. Beneath the sunscreen, salt -- the South China Sea, the Andaman Sea, the ghost of every ocean he had swum in, the chemical trace that the sea left on everything it touched. And beneath the salt, cheap hostel laundry detergent, the universal solvent of the backpacker circuit, the scent that smelled the same whether you were in Kuala Lumpur or Chiang Mai or Phnom Penh.

The towel smelled like his life. The towel smelled like twelve countries and four years and the person he had been before the person he had become, and the distance between the two persons was not measured in kilometres but in decisions, the decisions that had led him from a beach in Bali to a cell in Kuala Lumpur, the decisions that had been made not all at once but incrementally, one at a time, each decision small enough to be dismissed and large enough to matter, each decision a step on a staircase that descended from the sunlight into the underground, from the blue towel on the beach to the blue towel in the cell.

He wrapped the towel around his shoulders.

The wrapping was instinctive -- the gesture of a man who was cold and had a fabric, the gesture of a child wrapping a blanket around themselves, the gesture that said: *the world is too large and I am making it smaller, I am creating a space within the space, a warmth within the cold*. The towel was thin -- microfibre was thin, designed for compactness rather than insulation. It did not provide significant warmth. But it provided the sensation of something against the skin that was not steel and not concrete and not the institutional surfaces of the cell, something soft and familiar that carried, in its fibres, the chemical memory of a life that had been lived in sunlight.

He sat on the bench with the towel around his shoulders and the fluorescent tube buzzing above him and the bars green in front of him and the walls grey around him and the corridor beyond the bars and the building beyond the corridor and the city beyond the building and his mother in Hawthorn, thirty-seven hundred miles away, probably in her surgery right now, seeing patients, checking blood pressure, prescribing antibiotics, doing the things that GPs did on a Friday afternoon, not knowing, not yet knowing, not knowing until the phone rang at 3 AM.

The fluorescent tube buzzed. The buzz was the cell's only voice. The buzz was the sound of waiting, the sound of the system's clock, the sound that said: *tomorrow*. Tomorrow the embassy. Tomorrow the lawyer. Tomorrow the legal process that would begin with the charge and end with the sentence and the sentence would be determined by the law and the law was Section 39B and Section 39B was the death penalty and the death penalty was the end of the corridor, the last door, the door that did not open.

But tomorrow was on the other side of a night that had not yet begun, a night that would be spent on a steel bench under a fluorescent tube that did not turn off, in a cell with no window and no clock and no darkness and no way to measure the passage of time except by the calls to prayer from outside -- Maghrib at sunset, Isha at night, Fajr at dawn -- the prayers that were the city's heartbeat, the only clock that penetrated the walls of Cell C-7.

Connor pulled the towel tighter around his shoulders. The microfibre conformed to his body, a thin blue membrane between him and the cell's air, the towel performing its final function, the function it had not been designed for but that it had arrived at through the logic of a story that had been forty-seven days in the making.

He closed his eyes. The fluorescent light was visible through his eyelids -- not as light but as a red-orange glow, the blood-filtered luminance of closed eyes under strong light, the glow that said: *the light is still on, the light is always on, the light does not care that your eyes are closed*.

He opened his eyes. The light was there. The buzz was there. The cell was there.

He was there.

Connor James Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian, passport number PA7834521, case number DDW-2026-04783, charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, held in Cell C-7 at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, sitting on a steel bench with a blue towel around his shoulders, waiting for tomorrow.

Tomorrow, which was a word that the system had given him. Tomorrow, which was a promise that was also a deferral. Tomorrow, which was both hope and its absence, both the promise of action and the guarantee of delay, the word that kept him alive because alive was the condition of waiting for tomorrow and dead was the condition of tomorrow never coming.

The fluorescent tube buzzed.

The cell breathed.

Connor waited.

And somewhere outside the building, beyond the concrete and the steel and the bars painted green, beyond the corridor and the door and the parking area and the street, the city continued. KL continued. The traffic flowed. The hawker stalls sizzled. The Petronas Towers stood in the afternoon light. The call to prayer would come again -- Maghrib, at sunset, the fourth prayer, the prayer that marked the end of the day and the beginning of the night, and the night would come.

The night would be fluorescent and buzzing and nine square metres of grey concrete and green bars and a steel bench and a blue towel and the sound of a building that was never quiet and the light that was never off and the permanent, endless, institutional present of Cell C-7.

And after the night, tomorrow.

If tomorrow came.

---

*End of Chapter 32*
# Chapter 33: The Hours

Forty minutes had passed -- approximately, because the cell had no clock and Connor's phone was in a plastic bag somewhere beyond the locked doors, and the fluorescent tube on the ceiling operated outside of time, its light the same at noon and midnight. Forty minutes, and already the cell had ceased to be a room and become a world -- three metres by three metres of grey concrete and steel and the tube's unwavering hum, the world reduced to its constituent elements, the elements indifferent to the man sitting among them. The bench's cold had reached his bones. The cold was not air-conditioning cold but steel cold, the cold of a material that conducted heat away from the body faster than the body could produce it, the cold that would never warm because the steel's thermal mass was greater than his body's thermal output, the steel always winning.

He had his towel -- the blue Sea to Summit microfiber draped across his shoulders like a shawl, the only object the guard had not sealed in the plastic evidence bag, the towel that still smelled of sunscreen and salt and the life that had existed before the cell.

The panic came at approximately the one-hour mark.

One moment Connor was sitting on the bench with the towel around his shoulders, his mind operating in the numb, post-adrenaline state that had insulated him since the highway, the state that had gotten him through the processing and the fingerprinting and the questions that he had answered with the monosyllabic compliance of a man operating on autonomic function rather than conscious will. The next moment the insulation failed.

The insulation failed and the information arrived.

Four hundred and fifty grams. Section 39B. Fifty grams triggered the presumption. He had nine times the threshold. Not two times, not three times, not a marginal overage that a lawyer might argue down, but nine times -- 450 divided by 50, the mathematics simple, the mathematics devastating, the mathematics producing a number that was not a number but a verdict, that was not arithmetic but law, that was not quantity but category, the category being trafficking, the category being mandatory, the category being death.

Mandatory. The word was worse than the number because the number was abstract -- a quantity, a measurement, a value on a scale -- but the word was absolute. Mandatory. Not discretionary. Not recommended. The word that meant the judge had no choice and the system had no flexibility and the human being in the dock had no appeal to mercy because mercy had been removed from the formula in 1952 when the drafters of the Dangerous Drugs Act decided that the punishment would be death and the death would be mandatory and mandatory would mean mandatory.

And then the third word arrived, and it arrived not in the mind but in the body -- in the chest, in the gut, in the legs, in the hands wrapped in the blue towel. Death. The word bypassed cognition entirely and landed as contraction, as the sudden, involuntary tightening of every muscle group simultaneously, the body's total mobilisation against a threat it could not distinguish from a predator, from a charging animal, from the jaws of a beast. The body recognised death. The body had evolved to recognise death. The body's response was the oldest response, the response that predated language and law and the specific human invention of killing people with words spoken in courtrooms.

The phrase that Priya had said to him on the rooftop -- how many days ago? Twenty? Twenty-five? *Connor, the mandatory death penalty. Do you understand what mandatory means? It means there's no discretion. It means if you're caught with over fifty grams, the judge has to sentence you to death. Has to. It's not optional.*

He had kissed her. He had kissed her because kissing was easier than listening and listening would have required action and action would have required the dismantling of the machine and the machine had not been ready to be dismantled, not on the rooftop with the Petronas Towers glittering and the woman beautiful and the words just syllables, just sounds bouncing off the surface of his denial and falling like stones thrown at a wall.

Now the wall was gone. Now the stones were inside.

His breathing doubled in the space of three breaths. The sound was loud in the cell -- the concrete walls and the steel bench amplifying and returning every sound, the breathing becoming an echo of itself, producing the sensation that the cell was breathing with him, that the walls were expanding and contracting in rhythm with his lungs. The three metres compressed to two, to one, the ceiling lowering, the floor rising, the cell shrinking around him with the inexorable pressure of a vice. He stood -- the primate's instinct to make itself larger in the face of threat. He paced. Three steps to the bars. Three steps to the wall. The rubber sandals -- his Birkenstocks had been confiscated -- slapped on the concrete, slap-slap-slap, a metronome, and at each turn the wall appeared and the wall reminded him of the phrase and the phrase reminded him of the breathing and the breathing accelerated and the pacing accelerated and the acceleration was the spiral, the feedback loop, the system feeding on its own output, the loop with no circuit breaker, no mechanism for interruption except exhaustion, which would come when the body's reserves of adrenaline and cortisol were depleted and the fire burned itself out because there was nothing left to burn.

Three steps. Turn. Three steps. Turn. The bars. The wall. The bars. The wall.

Mandatory death penalty.

The phrase was stuck, the needle in the groove, each repetition adding weight until the three words were not words but architecture, the walls and ceiling and floor of a room more confining than the cell because the cell was temporary but the phrase was the law, and the law was permanent.

---

The denial arrived the way all biological defences arrived -- automatically, without conscious activation.

The machine. The old rationalisation engine, dormant since the highway, since the handcuffs. Now the machine rebooted.

*Maybe they'll see I'm just a mule.* The thought arrived warm -- judges had eyes, prosecutors had judgment, the system had to have room for the difference between Felix Decker, who orchestrated, and Connor Briggs, who carried.

*Maybe the embassy will intervene.* The Australian embassy. The consular services that existed for exactly this -- for the moment when an Australian citizen was in trouble abroad, when the passport that Connor had carried through twelve countries would exert its power, the power of citizenship, the power of the nation behind the passport. The embassy would send someone. The embassy would provide a lawyer. The embassy would contact Canberra. Canberra would contact Kuala Lumpur. The diplomatic channels would open and the channels would carry the message: *this is one of ours, this is an Australian, this is a boy from Hawthorn, and we do not leave our people to die in foreign prisons.*

*Maybe there's a deal.* He knew things. He knew names. Felix Decker. Wei. Mr. Tan, the man above Wei, who controlled the Petaling Street corridor. Auntie Lim at the packaging house in Sentul. Danny at the apartment in Brickfields. Ah Keat, the man with the scar on his neck who never spoke. He could describe the routes, the schedule, the pickup points and the drop points, the packaging at Wei's shop, the back room with the vacuum sealer and the scale and the heat gun. He could draw the network on a whiteboard. He was valuable. A cooperating witness was valuable. The police wanted the network, not the mule. The mule was the leaf and the network was the root and the police wanted the root. That was how it worked in every jurisdiction, in every procedural he'd ever half-watched -- the small fish traded the big fish and the system forgave the smallest fish to get the biggest.

*Maybe Felix was bluffing about the system being rigged.* This one was tissue-paper thin. Felix had bluffed about the money (it was less), the risk (it was more), Connor's safety (there was none). Maybe he'd bluffed about the reach, about the ability to silence witnesses in police custody.

The rationalisations held for approximately twelve minutes. He counted by the pacing -- four circuits per minute, steps as seconds, turns as tick marks, the cell as the dial.

Then they did not hold because the cell was still the cell and four hundred and fifty grams was still four hundred and fifty grams and the machine could produce hope but hope was not law and the law was what determined what happened next. Section 39B. Mandatory death penalty.

The rationalisations collapsed. And what was beneath them, what had been beneath every structure the machine had ever built, was terror. The pure, unprocessed terror of a man who was going to die and who knew it and who could not make the knowing stop.

---

He asked for things.

The asking was the third phase -- after the panic, after the denial. The asking was the phase of action, of doing, of reaching outward instead of cycling inward, the mind recognising that the internal resources were exhausted and the external resources were the only resources remaining.

He went to the bars. The bars were steel, painted green, vertical, spaced approximately ten centimetres apart, the gap between them sufficient to see through but insufficient to pass through, the gap that was the cell's only interface with the outside world, the aperture through which light and sound and air moved in and out but Connor did not.

The corridor was empty. No officer visible. The corridor extended to the left and right, grey concrete, lit by the tubes overhead, identical to the cell in its materials and its atmosphere, the corridor a larger version of the cell or the cell a smaller version of the corridor, the architecture of confinement scaling from the individual to the institutional, from the three-by-three-metre box to the building that contained it.

"Hello?" he said.

His voice was strange. His voice had not spoken for -- how long? An hour? Two hours? The voice that emerged was not the voice of Connor Briggs, not the voice that said *mate* and *legend* and *she'll be right*, not the voice that was confident and breezy and shaped by the suburbs of Melbourne and the hostels of Southeast Asia. The voice that emerged was thin. High. The voice of a man whose vocal cords were constricted by the same muscles that had been constricted by the panic, the throat tight, the airway narrow, the voice produced under compression, the sound squeezed through a passage that was too small for it, the voice that was the acoustic equivalent of the cell -- confining, restricted, the minimum space for the minimum sound.

"Hello? I need -- can I call the embassy? The Australian embassy."

The corridor did not respond. The fluorescent light hummed. The disinfectant smell persisted, the smell that had been present since he'd entered the cell, the smell that was the smell of cleanliness imposed on a space that was not clean but sanitised, the distinction being that cleanliness was the absence of dirt and sanitisation was the chemical suppression of what the dirt contained, and the chemical suppression did not remove the dirt but masked it, the way the fluorescent light did not remove the dark but replaced it.

"Hello?"

Footsteps. The footsteps came from the left, from the direction of the processing area, from the part of the building where the desks were and the computers were and the officers sat and did the work that officers did -- the paperwork, the phone calls, the data entry that transformed the physical fact of an arrest into the digital record of a case. The footsteps were unhurried. The footsteps were the footsteps of a man who was not responding to an emergency but to an interruption, the pace of a person who would arrive when they arrived and not before.

An officer appeared. Not the young officer who had processed him -- a different officer, older, forties, the rank insignia on his shoulder indicating a corporal, the face carrying the expression of a man who had worked the holding cells for years and had heard every request and every plea and every demand from every person who had ever occupied these cells and had developed, over those years, the particular professional neutrality that came from hearing the same things repeated by different mouths in different accents but always with the same underlying note, which was desperation.

"I need to call the Australian embassy," Connor said.

The officer looked at him. The look was brief, evaluative, the look of a man assessing a situation and determining the appropriate response. The response was not hostile. The response was not sympathetic. The response was institutional.

"Tomorrow," the officer said. "Consular access during office hours."

"But I have the right -- I was told I have the right to contact my embassy. The officer at the checkpoint said --"

"Tomorrow."

The word was a wall. The word was concrete. The word was the same material as the cell walls -- hard, grey, impermeable. Tomorrow. Not now. Not tonight. Tomorrow. The word contained within it the entirety of the night that stretched ahead, the hours between now and the morning, the hours during which the fluorescent light would hum and the cell would be three metres by three metres and the words *mandatory death penalty* would circle like birds that could not land.

"Can I have a lawyer? I need a lawyer."

"Lawyer will be arranged. Tomorrow."

Tomorrow. The word again. The word that answered every question with the same answer. Tomorrow the embassy. Tomorrow the lawyer. Tomorrow the things that the system owed him, the rights that the officer at the checkpoint had recited -- the right to remain silent, the right to legal representation, the rights that existed in the recitation but not in the implementation, the rights that were spoken at the moment of arrest and then stored, deferred, filed under *tomorrow*, the tomorrow that was always one day away and might always be one day away.

"Can I have some water?"

The water request was different. The water request was not legal, not institutional, not about rights. The water request was biological. The body needed water. The body had not had water since the bottle at Tapah, which was five or six hours ago -- the Mamee noodle snacks and the bottle of water that he'd consumed standing in the service area parking lot, the last meal and the last drink of a free man, consumed under a sky that was open and blue and without a ceiling.

The officer nodded. The nod was small, the nod of a man granting a request that was within his authority to grant, a request that required no paperwork and no supervisor and no *tomorrow*. Water was not a right that needed to be scheduled. Water was water.

The officer left. The footsteps receded. The corridor was empty again. The light hummed.

Three minutes later -- three circuits of the cell, twelve steps each circuit, thirty-six steps total -- the officer returned. He passed a plastic cup through the gap in the bars. The cup was white, opaque, the kind of cup that was stacked in dispensers beside water coolers in offices and waiting rooms and the public areas of institutional buildings. The cup was full. The water was warm -- not heated but not cool, the ambient temperature of water that had been sitting in a pipe or a tank in a building where the air conditioning cooled the air but not the plumbing.

Connor took the cup. He drank. The water tasted of pipes. The water tasted of the building's plumbing -- the metallic, faintly mineral taste of water that had travelled through old pipes, the taste that was not exactly bad but was not exactly water, was not the clean, neutral taste of the bottled water he'd been drinking for forty-seven days but the taste of infrastructure, of the system's pipes carrying the system's water to the system's prisoners. The water tasted of the institution. The water tasted of where he was.

He drank it all. He held the empty cup. The cup was the second object in the cell -- the first being the towel, the third being himself. Three objects. A man, a towel, a cup. The inventory of a life reduced to its minimum components.

He put the cup on the bench. He sat beside it. The bench was still cold. The towel was still on his shoulders. The strip light still hummed.

Tomorrow.

---

He thought about his parents.

The thinking was not a choice. The mind, denied new input, turned to its archive. The archive was memory. The memory was home.

His mother first. Karen Briggs. Her last text was on the phone in the evidence bag: *Are you eating well? Please call soon. Love Mum xxx.* Seven words and three kisses, the minimum unit of a mother's worry, calibrated over four years to the precise dosage that would not drive him further away. *Please call soon.* He could not call. His phone was in a bag on the other side of a locked door and the locked door was the boundary between the person he had been -- a person who could pick up the phone and say *I'm fine, Mum, don't worry* -- and the person he now was. She was in Hawthorn right now -- the kitchen, probably, a cup of tea, the phone on the table, wondering if the silence meant he was busy or happy or simply the usual Connor silence that four years of Southeast Asian travel had acclimatised her to. She didn't know. The not-knowing was the only mercy the universe was offering, the mercy that protected her from the knowledge that her son was in a cell and the charge was capital and the word *mandatory* meant what the word meant, and the penalty meant her son, her boy, the child she had carried and raised and watched grow tall and tan and confident and entitled and ignorant and doomed.

His father. David Briggs. The large hands, the firm handshake, the voice of a man who built things and believed problems were solved by competent people making competent decisions. His father's hand on Connor's shoulder at Tullamarine Airport, four years ago -- the last physical contact, the hand heavy with unspoken fear, the hand of a man who knew his authority would not extend to wherever his son was going. *The rules don't care who you are.* His father had said that at the gate, and it was the same thing Priya had said on the rooftop and Tomoko on the staircase and Mama Siti in the kitchen and Ahmad at the checkpoint. The rules that did not care that Connor was Australian. The rules that did not care about his Instagram followers or his compass tattoo or the particular, cultivated casualness that was his armour against the world, the armour that had deflected every warning and every truth and every attempt by the people who loved him to tell him that the armour was not real, that the casualness was not protection. Every person who had ever told Connor Briggs that the rules applied to him had been right and he had been wrong and the wrongness was total and the wrongness was the cell and the cell was three metres by three metres.

He thought about Priya. She was in the air -- somewhere over the Indian Ocean, the flight path from KL to London crossing the same latitudes the British had once crossed in the opposite direction, the brown woman flying home from the country the white empire had administered and the white man sitting in a cell in the country the empire had left. She was carrying a letter addressed to Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail that described what she knew about Felix Decker and the network, the deliveries she had observed with the analytical eye of a medical student trained to derive diagnoses from symptoms. The letter, combined with Tomoko's photographs and Mei Ling's records and Razak's folder, might shift Connor's status from trafficker to witness. But the letter was travelling at nine hundred kilometres per hour at twelve thousand metres, and the ground was where the cell was, and the distance was measured not in kilometres but in hours -- the hours until Priya landed, until the letter entered the system, until the system decided whether a letter from a British-Indian medical student changed things or simply joined the pile marked *tomorrow*. The hours that he had to survive. The hours that lay between him and the morning when the embassy would come and the lawyer would come and Ahmad might come and the machinery of his defence would begin operating, the machinery that was currently dormant because the machinery operated on schedules and the schedules were diurnal, following the same sun that was now below the horizon, and below the horizon was night, and night was the time when the machinery stopped and the cells continued and the people inside them were alone with their three metres and their towels and the words that circled and would not land.

---

He thought about Lena.

L-E-N-A. The letters carved into the wood of Bed 7 by a Swedish woman who had done exactly what Connor had done -- carried for Felix, escalated from envelopes to the final load, been arrested at a checkpoint on the same highway, the same road, the same destination Connor had not reached. Lena was in Kajang Prison now, the women's facility south of KL, where she had been for four years and would remain until the court decided whether she would live or die. Lena had sat in a cell like this one. Maybe this cell. She had sat on a bench and heard the hum and felt the cold and thought the same thoughts in the same progression -- panic, denial, planning, despair -- because the cycle was not individual but universal, the biological program that activated when the body recognised it could not escape and the mind recognised that escape was not the issue, the issue was time, the issue was how to exist inside the time that the cell demanded.

She had carved her name. That was the answer. She had known there would be a next one -- the person who would sleep in Bed 7 after her, who would place their hand on the carved letters and not read them, who would be recruited by Felix and carry packages and ignore warnings and arrive, eventually, in a cell like this. The carving was her warning, the Lantern Hostel's equivalent of the markings prisoners made on cell walls, the testimony of the consumed.

Connor had not read it. Forty-seven nights in Bed 7 and he had not read the name. His hand had brushed the carved letters on the first night and the touch had not registered, the machine converting it from sensation to nothing. He had not read the drug penalty sign at KLIA2, or the hostel poster, or Priya's guidebook, or the Dangerous Drugs Act she had printed and left on his pillow. He had not read any of the texts the world had written for him, the texts placed in his path with the frequency and urgency of a world trying desperately to communicate one piece of information: *this country will kill you for what you are doing.* And now he was in a room with nothing to read except the walls, and the walls said nothing, and the silence of the walls was the silence he had chosen -- the silence of a man who had been surrounded by information and had refused it all.

---

Ahmad.

The name surfaced suddenly -- Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, this building. Ahmad was here. His desk was somewhere on the other side of the locked doors and the corridors that separated cell C-7 from the offices where the narcotics officers did their work. The machine that had prevented Connor from speaking to Ahmad -- the machine that required denial to operate -- was gone. You could not deny what you were sitting inside. You could not rationalise a three-by-three-metre concrete room. He could speak now. He could say the simple sentence that would have changed everything: *My name is Connor Briggs. I've been carrying methamphetamine for Felix Decker.*

He went to the bars. "I need to speak to Sergeant Ahmad. Narcotics Division. He gave me his card. I have information about a trafficking network operating out of a hostel on Petaling Street. Names, locations, routes. I can cooperate."

The corporal appeared, unhurried.

"No, please -- this is important. Sergeant Ahmad knows about Felix Decker. He's been watching --"

"Sergeant Ahmad is not on duty tonight. Tomorrow."

Tomorrow. The word again. The concrete wall of the word. Connor returned to the bench. The towel had cooled against his shoulders, the microfiber releasing its warmth into the cell's air-conditioned atmosphere, the warmth leaving the fabric the way the warmth was leaving Connor's body, the slow, physical process of a warm thing becoming a cold thing in a cold environment.

He pulled the towel over his head. A hood. A tent. A cave. The towel's blue fabric blocked the blue-white buzz and the blue was the blue of the towel and not the blue-white of the tube and the difference mattered because the towel's blue was his blue, was the blue of the Andaman Sea and the Blue Mountains and the swimming pools and the beaches where the towel had been, the blue that was the colour of the life that had existed before the cell. Under the towel, in the small, dark, soft space that the fabric created, he could not see the cell. He could not see the bars or the wall or the squat toilet or the corridor. He could only see the blue of the towel and the dark beneath it and the dark was better than the light because the dark was chosen and the light was imposed and the difference between chosen and imposed was the difference between freedom and imprisonment, the difference that he was learning now, in the fluorescent hours, with the intimacy of a student whose education had been delayed but was now proceeding at the accelerated pace of total immersion.

Under the towel, he closed his eyes. Under the towel, in the dark, with his eyes closed, he could be anywhere. He could be in a hostel dorm. He could be on a beach. He could be in his childhood bedroom in Hawthorn with the cricket posters and the surfboard in the corner and the sound of his mother in the kitchen and the smell of whatever she was cooking and the certainty -- the absolute, unquestioned, foundational certainty -- that the world was safe and the world was his and the world would never, ever put him in a cell.

Under the towel, he breathed. The towel smelled of sunscreen and the sea. Under the towel, for a moment, the words stopped circling.

---

The call to prayer came from somewhere far away.

The muezzin's voice entered the cell the way water entered stone -- not through openings but through the material itself, through the concrete and the steel and the glass and the institutional architecture that was designed to keep sounds out but that could not keep out the sound of a human voice amplified by speakers mounted on a minaret and projected across the city by the power of a tradition that was older than the building, older than the law, older than the statute that had put Connor in this cell.

The voice was beautiful.

The beauty was not the beauty of performance. The muezzin was not singing for an audience. The muezzin was performing an obligation -- the adhan, the call, the summons to prayer that the Islamic tradition required five times daily and that the Malaysian mosques fulfilled with the particular, Malaysian expression of the adhan, the melodic line that was both Arabic and Malay, both universal and local, the voice rising and falling in the intervals that had been established fourteen centuries ago and had been repeated, with variations, every day since.

*Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.*

The words reached the cell in fragments, the consonants and vowels scattered by the distance and the concrete, the voice arriving as more melody than language, more shape than substance, the muezzin's words broken into their musical components and reassembled by the cell's acoustics into something that was neither the original call nor a different call but a third thing, a cell-filtered version, the call to prayer as heard from inside a holding cell at Dang Wangi, the sound that was beautiful and terrible and completely indifferent to Connor's situation.

The indifference was the beauty's sharpest edge. The muezzin did not know Connor was in the cell. The muezzin did not know that his voice was reaching a twenty-seven-year-old Australian backpacker who had been arrested for drug trafficking and was sitting on a steel bench with a blue towel over his head. The muezzin was performing the adhan because the time for prayer had arrived and the adhan was performed when the time arrived, and the time arrived regardless of who was listening and regardless of where they were listening from and regardless of whether the listening was voluntary or involuntary, whether the listener was a believer at a mosque or a prisoner in a cell or a tourist on a rooftop or no one at all.

The call did not care. The call was, in its indifference, the purest expression of the truth that Connor's father had spoken at Tullamarine and that Connor had spent forty-seven days denying: *the rules don't care who you are.* The adhan was a rule. The adhan was a call that operated on its own schedule, by its own logic, for its own purposes, and the purposes did not include Connor Briggs. The purposes included the faithful, the community, the tradition, the God to whom the call was directed -- but not Connor. Connor was incidental. Connor was the accidental listener, the prisoner who happened to be within earshot, the man whose cell happened to be in a building that happened to be within range of a mosque that happened to be performing the obligation that it had performed every day for however many decades or centuries the mosque had existed.

The voice faded. The call ended. The silence returned -- not a full silence but the cell's version of silence, which was the fluorescent hum and the distant sounds of the building (a phone somewhere, a door closing, the mechanical rhythm of an institution operating through the evening) and Connor's breathing, which had slowed, which had returned to something approaching normal, the respiratory rate descending from the panic's peak to the lower, slower rhythm of a body that had exhausted its panic and was now in the phase that followed, the phase that was not calm but was the absence of acute distress, the plateau between the peaks, the flatland of endurance.

---

The fluorescent light never turned off.

The permanence was the horror. The switch was somewhere beyond the bars, in the territory of the people who controlled the cell and its conditions, and the institution had decided: light. Always. The light of surveillance, of the state's need to see what was in the cell at all times, the light that served not the prisoner's comfort but the institution's control. The light was the opposite of the ceiling fan in the hostel. The fan in Dorm 3 had moved -- blades cutting the warm air, producing wind and shadow and the rhythmic comfort of a machine working for you, its tick marking time, each revolution a unit of time passing toward morning and then afternoon and then night, and the night was dark and the dark was relief. The tube did not move. The tube produced a single, sustained, unwavering tone, the tone of a system in steady state, the tone of permanence. The fan had been in a place where time moved. The tube was in a place where time stopped -- no day, no night, just the light, always the light, the light that made every moment identical to every other moment. The light of consequence. The light of after.

Connor lay on the bench. The steel was cold beneath his shoulder blades. The towel was beneath his head, folded into a pillow, the microfiber providing a thin barrier between his skull and the steel, the barrier insufficient for comfort but sufficient for the idea of comfort, the idea that a pillow was present and that the presence of a pillow meant that this was a place where sleeping was possible, even if sleeping was not possible, even if the light was on and the hum was loud and the words were still circling -- mandatory, death, penalty -- the three birds that could not land.

He stared at the tube. The tube stared back. The tube was, in this moment, the most present thing in his existence -- more present than the walls, more present than the bars, more present than the distant sounds of the building or the fading memory of the muezzin's call. The tube was the cell's eye. The tube was the cell's voice. The tube was the cell's answer to every question, and the answer was always the same: *you are here, and here is lit, and the light is not for you.*

He thought about nothing. He tried to think about nothing. The trying was the failure -- the mind could not think about nothing because the mind's nature was to think, to process, to produce, and the mind's production in this cell was the words, always the words, the three words and their variants and their implications and their echoes. The words were not thoughts. The words were conditions. The words were the atmosphere. The words were the air he breathed, the light he saw, the hum he heard. The words were the cell.

The three words.

He had been in the cell for approximately two hours. The approximation was based on the pacing -- the circuits he had counted, the minutes he had derived, the time he had estimated with the imprecise mathematics of a man using his body as a measuring instrument. Two hours. Two hours of the flat white light. Two hours of the hum. Two hours of the three-by-three-metre world.

Two hours.

The night was long. The night was the distance between now and tomorrow. The night was the territory that he had to cross to reach the morning, to reach the embassy, to reach the lawyer, to reach Ahmad. The night was the desert that lay between the cell and the oasis, the lightless hours -- except the hours were not lightless, the hours were lit, perpetually lit, the fluorescent tube ensuring that the night would not be night but a continuation of the timeless, directionless, institutional light that was the cell's permanent condition.

He closed his eyes. The closing did not produce darkness. The closing produced the red-orange glow of light passing through eyelids, the tube's glare penetrating the thin skin and the blood vessels and reaching the retina even through the closed lids, the light refusing to be shut out, the light insisting on its presence, the light saying: *you cannot escape me. I am the condition. I am the cell. I am here.*

He pulled the towel over his face. The blue fabric dimmed the light. Under the towel, with his eyes closed, the light was finally reduced to a suggestion rather than a presence, the faintest glow of blue-filtered fluorescence, the minimum light, the almost-dark.

In the almost-dark, he waited.

---

A sound.

The sound was different from the sounds that had constituted the cell's acoustic environment for the past two hours -- different from the hum, different from the distant building sounds, different from his own breathing. The sound was specific, metallic, close. The sound was a key.

A key in a lock.

The sound of metal entering metal, of tumblers engaging, of a mechanism designed to open when the correct key was inserted and turned. The sound was at the cell door -- the barred door, the green-painted bars, the door that separated the cell from the corridor and the corridor from the world.

Connor sat up. The towel fell from his face. The fluorescent light hit him full -- the blue-white assault after the towel's blue shade, the tube reasserting its dominance, the cell snapping back into focus, every surface and every edge and every bar and every bolt and every stain and every crack in the concrete visible in the comprehensive, merciless illumination.

The key turned. The lock clicked. The door opened.

An officer stood in the corridor. Not the corporal from before -- a different officer, younger, the face unfamiliar, the uniform the same. The officer held the door open with one hand and with the other hand gestured into the corridor, where a second figure stood.

A man. Mid-thirties. Malay. Average height, average build, the build that was unremarkable in the specific way that made a person forgettable. He wore a dark red T-shirt, jeans, running shoes. His hair was short, neatly cut. His face was calm -- notably calm, the calm of a person who was where he expected to be, or who had decided to treat the situation with the equanimity that was either a personality trait or a performance.

The officer ushered the man into the cell. The door closed. The lock clicked. The footsteps receded.

The man surveyed the cell -- a quick inventory, eyes moving from wall to wall, bench to toilet, bars to tube. Then he looked at Connor. The look was brief, open, the look of a man acknowledging another man in a shared space. He smiled -- small, practiced, the minimum unit of human connection.

"Bar fight," he said, with a shrug that said *it's nothing, it's the kind of thing that happens to anyone on a Friday night*. The shrug was the body language of a man who had been in cells before, or who wanted Connor to believe he had.

He extended his hand.

"Rizal," he said.

The name entered the cell and the cell held it. The fluorescent light hummed. The night stretched ahead, unmeasured and immeasurable.

Connor looked at the hand -- open, extended, the universal gesture of greeting. He took it.

"Connor," he said.

And the cell, which had been a space for one, became a space for two.

*End of Chapter 33*
# Chapter 34: Rizal

Four hours in Cell C-7 and Connor had spoken maybe sixty words to other human beings, most of them in one direction -- the arresting officer reading the charge, the transport officer saying *tomorrow* three times to three different questions, the processing clerk issuing instructions in procedural monotone, the guard tossing the blue towel into the cell with two words of English: "For comfort." Sixty words. Four hours. The fluorescent light buzzing its sixty-hertz hum into the concrete box and the concrete box humming back and the exchange between light and architecture being the only conversation the cell had to offer.

The blue towel was around his shoulders. The towel was not providing comfort. The towel was preventing his body temperature from dropping further in the eighteen-degree air conditioning that Dang Wangi maintained across its holding cells. Comfort required human input -- a voice, a face, the back-and-forth of conversation, the social stimulus that his brain had been receiving for twenty-seven years and that had been severed four hours ago with the abruptness of a power outage. He was the man who had befriended Felix because Felix was there, who had fallen for Priya because her attention was a form of oxygen. He was a man whose entire architecture of self depended on the presence of other people, and the other people were gone -- Priya on a plane, Jake in Langkawi, Felix wherever Felix went when the mule was caught -- and the phone that held their names was in an evidence bag and the cell was three metres by three metres and the silence was not the absence of sound but the absence of anyone who cared whether he made sound or not.

He sat on the steel bench with his head in his hands and the blue towel on his shoulders and the fear that had passed through fear into something chronic, something metabolic, and he was, for the first time in his twenty-seven years, completely alone.

And then the corridor filled with sound.

---

The sound was footsteps. Two sets. One heavy, the measured tread of a police officer in standard-issue boots, the boot-steps that Connor had been hearing at intervals all afternoon -- the guard walking the corridor, checking cells, the mechanical perambulation of a man performing a routine that required his body but not his attention. The second set was different. Lighter. The sound of shoes, not boots. Shoes on concrete. The sound of a civilian walking in a place where civilians did not walk voluntarily.

The footsteps grew louder. Closer. The corridor had the acoustic properties of a concrete tube -- sound travelled through it with minimal absorption, the hard surfaces reflecting rather than dampening, the footsteps arriving at Connor's cell with a clarity that made them seem closer than they were, the acoustic illusion of a space that had been designed for surveillance, not comfort.

Connor sat up on the bench. The sitting up was involuntary -- the body responding to the sound of approaching humans the way a dog responded to a key in a lock, the autonomous activation of attention, the social animal's hard-wired response to the presence of its species. He straightened. He pulled the towel tighter around his shoulders. He looked at the bars.

The guard appeared first. He was the same guard who had been on shift since Connor arrived -- a Malay man in his forties, solidly built, the face neutral, professional -- a cell corridor face, carried the way a uniform was carried, as a tool rather than an expression. He walked past Connor's cell without looking in, which was standard -- the guards looked in on scheduled checks, every thirty minutes by Connor's estimation, and between checks they passed the cells as they passed the walls, as features of the environment rather than points of engagement.

Behind the guard, a man.

The man was Malaysian. Thirties, maybe thirty-two, maybe thirty-five -- the age difficult to pin because the man's face had the quality of faces that settled early and aged slowly, the bone structure set, the features defined, the face that would look substantially the same at thirty and forty and fifty. He was solidly built -- not tall, maybe five-eight, but wide through the shoulders, stocky, solid, weight sitting on him like something he'd been born with, the shoulders and arms of someone for whom strength was occupational rather than recreational. His hair was black, short, neat. His skin was brown -- the medium brown of the Malay majority, the skin that placed him in the demographic that constituted the majority of Malaysia's population and the majority of its police force and the majority of its prison population and the majority of its everything.

He wore civilian clothes. A dark polo shirt. Jeans. Running shoes -- white, scuffed, rubber-soled, the same pair for mosque and market. No watch. No rings. No visible tattoos. Nothing on his person that distinguished him from the millions of other Malaysian men in their thirties who wore polo shirts and jeans and running shoes and moved through the world with the unremarkable solidity of people who were not noticed because they did not invite notice.

The guard stopped at Cell C-7. He took keys from his belt. The keys were on a ring -- a large ring, institutional, the kind that janitors carried in American movies but that here was carried by police officers assigned to the holding cell corridor, the ring containing the keys to every cell in the row, each key identical to every other key because the cells were identical to every other cell and the locks were identical to every other lock and the system did not differentiate between one cell and another because differentiation was the province of the humans inside, not the structures around them.

The guard unlocked the cell. The lock turned with a sound that was metallic and final, the sound of tumblers engaging, the mechanical vocabulary of access and restriction. The door swung open. The hinges were oiled -- the door moved silently, the silence a maintenance achievement in a building where most things creaked.

The man stepped into the cell. The stepping was casual -- not the step of a man entering a cage but the step of a man entering a room, the foot placed with the confidence of someone who had been in rooms like this before, who understood the dimensions, who knew where the bench was and where the toilet was and where the light fell and where it didn't.

The guard closed the door. The lock turned again. The guard walked away. The footsteps receded. The corridor was silent.

The man stood in the centre of the cell. The centre was approximately one-and-a-half metres from Connor's bench. In a cell of nine square metres, one-and-a-half metres was both a distance and a proximity -- far enough to not be threatening, close enough to be social, the distance that humans maintained in elevators and queues and all the spaces where strangers were forced to share volumes that intimacy had not sanctioned.

The man looked around the cell. The looking was slow, deliberate, the survey of a person acquainting himself with an environment -- the bench, the toilet, the walls, the bars, the fluorescent light. His eyes moved across the surfaces the way a tradesman's eyes moved across a new job site -- cataloguing, assessing, the professional's appraisal of a space that was not personal but operational.

His eyes reached Connor. They settled. The settling was not a stare -- it was a regard, the social regard of one person acknowledging another person's presence in a shared space, the look that strangers exchanged in waiting rooms and train carriages and all the places where proximity was involuntary and acknowledgement was the currency that purchased coexistence.

"The light, right?" the man said.

His voice was unremarkable. Not deep, not high. The English was good -- accented, the consonants slightly harder than a native speaker's, the vowels slightly flatter, but fluent, the English of a Malaysian who had been educated in the national school system where English was compulsory, or the English of a man who had spent time around foreigners, who had absorbed the language through immersion rather than study.

"The light," the man said again, looking up at the fluorescent tube. "It never goes off. They do that on purpose, you know. Messes with your head. You lose track of time. That's the point."

Connor looked at the man. The man was looking at the light. The man's face, illuminated from directly above by the fluorescent tube, was mapped with the particular shadows that overhead light created -- the eye sockets slightly darkened, the cheekbones highlighted, the nose casting a shadow down the upper lip. The face was not handsome or ugly. The face was a face. It was human. It was present. It was the first face that had spoken to Connor in full sentences since the arresting officer on the highway, and the fullness of the sentences -- the casual, conversational, almost companionable sentences about the light and its purpose -- was so far from the monosyllabic proceduralism of every other human interaction in the past six hours that the effect was physical, a loosening in Connor's chest, the relaxation of a tension that he hadn't known was there until it eased.

"Yeah," Connor said. His voice was hoarse. The hoarseness surprised him -- he hadn't spoken in four hours, and the vocal cords had apparently entered a state of disuse, the muscles that produced speech having stood down when speech became purposeless. "Yeah, the light's doing my head in."

The man nodded. The nod was sympathetic -- not performative, not exaggerated, just the small, downward motion of a head that had heard something and agreed with it. The nod said: *I understand. I'm in here too. The light is doing my head in as well.*

The man walked to the bench. The bench was three metres long -- bolted to the wall, steel, the surface flat and unpadded, designed for sitting rather than comfort. Connor was at the left end. The man sat at the right end. The gap between them was approximately one-and-a-half metres -- the same distance that had separated them when the man was standing, the distance maintained not by calculation but by instinct, the social instinct that calibrated physical proximity according to relationship, and the relationship between two strangers in a cell was the relationship of the gap, the metre-and-a-half that said *I'm here but I'm not in your space*.

The man sat. The sitting was unhurried. He placed his back against the wall, the way you sat when you expected to be sitting for a while, the posture of someone settling in. He extended his legs. The running shoes were scuffed, the soles worn -- worn thin at the heels, walked-in, the shoes of a particular socioeconomic band that moved through the city on foot and on public transport rather than in the air-conditioned interiors of Protons and Peroduas.

He stretched. The stretch was physical, genuine -- the reaching of arms overhead, the arching of the back, the expansion of the chest, the movements of a body that had been confined and was now recalibrating, redistributing its tensions across the available space. The stretch was ordinary. The stretch was the thing that people did when they sat down after a period of standing or walking. The stretch was human.

"Stupid thing, honestly," the man said, settling back against the wall. He looked at Connor. He smiled. The smile was small, self-deprecating, the smile of a man about to tell a story about his own foolishness. "Bar fight. Changkat. Had too much to drink, said the wrong thing to the wrong guy, and then..." He made a gesture with his hand -- a quick, illustrative movement that suggested a punch thrown, the physical shorthand for violence that transcended language. "Woke up with the police standing over me. The other guy's nose is broken. I'm in here."

He shook his head. The head-shake was rueful, the gesture of a man who recognised his own idiocy and was neither proud of it nor destroyed by it but simply observing it, the way you observed weather -- *it happened, it was unfortunate, it will pass*.

"Stupid," he said again. "My boss is going to kill me."

The phrase *my boss is going to kill me* was so ordinary, so completely the phrase that every person who had ever done something foolish at night and would face consequences in the morning had used, that it landed in the cell like a piece of furniture from the outside world -- familiar, normal, the linguistic artefact of a life that operated on the axis of employment and socialising and the consequences of mixing the two. The phrase was the opposite of Section 39B. The phrase was the opposite of mandatory death penalty. The phrase was the vocabulary of a man whose worst problem was a broken nose and an angry boss, and the vocabulary was a window -- a small, verbal window that opened onto the world outside the cell, the world where people had bar fights and bosses and the word *kill* was a metaphor rather than a statute.

Connor felt something shift. The shift was tectonic -- not large, not visible, but deep, the movement of a plate beneath the surface. The plate was the plate of isolation, the solid mass of aloneness that had been compressing him for four hours, and the shift was caused by the man's voice, by the man's presence, by the simple, irreducible fact that there was another person in the cell and the person was speaking and the speaking was directed at Connor and the direction meant that Connor was no longer alone.

"I'm Rizal," the man said.

He extended his hand. The hand was across the gap -- reaching from the right end of the bench to the space between them, the hand offered in the universal gesture of introduction, the handshake that cultures worldwide had adopted as the first physical transaction between strangers. The hand was clean, the nails trimmed, the skin callused across the palm, the hand of a man who worked with his hands, who gripped things, who used his body as a tool.

Connor took the hand. The handshake was firm but not aggressive -- the grip calibrated to the middle register of social introduction, not the bone-crushing assertion of dominance and not the limp surrender of indifference but the measured, appropriate pressure of two strangers establishing contact. The hand was warm. The warmth was the warmth of a living body, the metabolic heat that humans produced and transmitted through their skin, and the warmth passed through the handshake from Rizal's palm to Connor's palm and the transfer was the first warm thing Connor had felt in four hours.

"Connor," Connor said.

"Connor," Rizal repeated. The repetition was the way Malaysians often processed foreign names -- saying the name back, tasting the syllables, fitting the foreign phonemes into the Malay phonological framework. "Australian?"

"Yeah. Melbourne."

"Melbourne. Cricket. Coffee. That lane with the street art."

"Hosier Lane."

"Hosier Lane, that's it." Rizal smiled again. The smile was the smile of a man who had just made a connection, who had found a piece of shared knowledge between himself and a stranger, the social lubrication of common ground. "My cousin went to Melbourne. Studied engineering at... Monash? RMIT? One of those."

"Monash," Connor said. "I went to Monash."

This was true. He had gone to Monash. He had attended for one year. He had studied business. He had dropped out. But the statement -- *I went to Monash* -- was not the full truth, it was the edited version, the version he had been telling for four years, the version that implied completion and competence and the shared institutional identity that came from naming a university. In a holding cell at Dang Wangi, the version was what it was. Nobody was checking transcripts.

"Small world," Rizal said. The phrase was a cliche, the cliche that people used when coincidences appeared in conversations between strangers, but the cliche was functional -- it performed the work of establishing that the world was small and that the two people in this cell had things in common and that the having-in-common was a bridge and the bridge was crossable.

Rizal leaned back against the wall. He reached into his pocket and emerged with a single cigarette, slightly bent, the paper wrinkled from pocket-storage. No pack. Just the one cigarette.

"The guard let me keep one," Rizal said, noticing Connor's look. "Professional courtesy."

He produced a lighter from his other pocket -- small, red, disposable, the BIC lighter that existed in the gap between regulation and reality, the gap that Malaysian institutions maintained between what the rules said and what happened. Rizal lit the cigarette. The flame appeared for two seconds and disappeared, leaving behind the orange glow of the ember.

The smoke filled the cell. The smoke was the most alive thing Connor had experienced since the arrest -- organic, warm, the acrid-sweet scent of tobacco displacing the disinfectant and the older smell beneath it, the smell that decades of confinement had baked into the concrete. The smoke was a visitor from the outside world, and Connor inhaled it the way a starving man inhaled the smell of food.

"Sorry," Rizal said, gesturing with the cigarette. "Should have asked. You mind?"

"No," Connor said. "It's good, actually."

"So," Rizal said, exhaling smoke toward the fluorescent light where it rose in a white-grey column. "What happened to you, then?"

The question was the casual interrogative of a cellmate, not a police officer. *What are you in for, what's your story.* Connor looked at Rizal's open face and felt the familiarity of it -- not the features but the energy, the posture, the expression. A hundred hostel common rooms had trained him to recognise this face, the face that said: *I'm here. You're here. Let's talk.*

"It's a long story," Connor said.

"Brother," Rizal said, gesturing at the cell, "we've got nothing but time."

Connor almost smiled. The muscles achieved approximately 60 percent of it.

"I'm not sure I should..." Connor began.

"Hey, no pressure." Rizal raised his free hand, palm out. "You don't have to tell me anything. I'm just..." He shrugged. "I'm a talker. My wife says it's my worst quality. Can't sit in a room with someone without trying to have a conversation. It's a problem."

The self-deprecation was disarming -- the generosity of a person who offered their own weakness as a gift, making the space safer, the gap on the bench smaller without either person having moved.

"You married?" Connor asked. The question surprised him -- it had emerged from the social autopilot his brain was now running at full capacity.

"Six years," Rizal said. "Her name's Ain. Two kids. Boy and a girl. She's going to be furious." He drew on the cigarette. "The bar fight thing. She told me to stop going to Changkat. She said *one day you're going to hit someone and end up in a cell*." He exhaled smoke. "She was right. She's always right. That's the other problem."

"What about you?" Rizal asked. "Married? Girlfriend?"

"I had a..." Connor paused. Priya. The name rose in his mind and the name carried weight -- the weight of a person, the weight of mornings in the kitchen and afternoons at the Batu Caves and the night on the air well bench when she'd asked about Malaysian law and he'd kissed her to avoid answering. "There was someone. She left."

"Left you?"

"Left KL. Went back to London."

"Ah." Rizal nodded. The nod was knowing -- the nod of a man who understood that relationships had geographies and that geographies had endings. "Long distance doesn't work. My brother tried it with a girl from Sarawak. Lasted two months."

"Yeah," Connor said. "It wouldn't have worked."

Rizal finished the cigarette. He dropped the butt on the concrete floor and ground it out with his shoe. The grinding was thorough -- the shoe twisting on the butt, crushing it, extinguishing the ember completely, habitual, careful about fire even in a concrete cell. The butt lay on the floor, a small cylinder of grey ash and white paper, the residue of seven minutes of combustion that had changed the cell's atmosphere from institutional to human.

The smoke lingered. Rizal settled back against the wall, his posture relaxed now, his eyes moving idly across the cell until they landed on Connor's towel.

"Nice towel," Rizal said.

Connor looked down at the blue microfiber draped over his shoulders. The towel that had been with him through twelve countries. The towel that smelled of sunscreen and the South China Sea and the accumulated history of his travels. The towel that the guard had tossed into the cell for comfort.

"Smart to keep it," Rizal continued. "It gets cold in here. The AC. They keep it cold on purpose, same as the light. Messes with your body, you know? You can't sleep if you're cold. You can't sleep if the light's on. You can't sleep, you get tired, you get confused. And confused people..."

He didn't finish the sentence. The unfinished sentence hung in the air the way the cigarette smoke had hung -- present, suggestive, the meaning clear without the words. Confused people talked. Confused people cooperated. Confused people signed things.

The observation was sharper than a bouncer's casual knowledge should have been. But Connor didn't notice the sharpness. He noticed the solidarity -- *they* were the police, and Rizal was on his side of the bars.

"I didn't know about the cold," Connor said. "I thought the AC was just... on."

"On, yeah, but on high. Always high. The offices upstairs, they have heaters. I know a guy who worked here. He said the holding cells are set to sixteen degrees. They want you uncomfortable. It's a technique."

"You seem to know a lot about this place," Connor said.

Rizal shrugged. "I've been here before. Not this cell. Another one. Two years ago. Different bar fight." He smiled. The smile was sheepish, the smile of a man whose history contained repetitions that he was not proud of. "I told you, Changkat is my problem. Too many bars, too many drunk guys, too many chances for things to go wrong."

"What happened the first time?"

"Night in the cell. Fine in the morning. Magistrate, pay a fine, community service, go home. Ain didn't speak to me for a week." He laughed. The laugh was short, genuine, rueful with the memory of his wife's anger -- a different kind of anger from the anger of the law, a domestic anger, an anger that was negotiable. "This time might be worse. The other guy's nose. That's proper damage. Might be ABH. Might be a few days in here."

"What do you do?" Connor asked. "For work?"

"Bouncer," Rizal said. "Club on Changkat. SUTRA. You know it?"

Connor didn't know it. He had been to Changkat -- the nightlife district that Felix had taken him to on the first nights, the street of bars and clubs and the Malaysian entertainment industry's concentration point, the street where the night economy happened. But SUTRA was not a name he recognised. He had been to other places, Felix's places, the bars where Felix was known and the drinks were free and the VIP sections opened without question.

"Big place," Rizal said. "Three floors. House music. Lot of tourists. That's where I learned English, actually. Tourists. You talk to them every night. *No, sir, you can't bring that in. No, ma'am, the capacity is full. Yes, the DJ starts at eleven.* After a few years you sound like a guidebook."

"Sounds like a good gig," Connor said.

"It's okay. The money's okay. The hours are bad. You're up all night, sleep all day. Your wife thinks you're having an affair because you come home at four AM smelling like perfume and beer. You're not having an affair -- you're just surrounded by drunk people who fall on you." He paused. "The fights are the worst part. People get stupid when they drink. Especially tourists. No offence."

"None taken."

"Australians are the worst." Rizal said this with a grin -- the grin that softened the statement, that turned it from observation into joke, the humour of a man speaking to an Australian about Australians and trusting that the Australian would receive the stereotype with the good humour that the delivery invited. "Three drinks and they want to wrestle. Every time. Is it the sun? Is there something in the water in Australia that makes you all want to fight after three beers?"

Connor laughed -- small, reduced, but real. "It might be the sun," he said.

"It might be the sun," Rizal agreed, stretching again, making himself at home in the uncomfortable space. The conversation paused, and the pause was comfortable. Four hours ago silence had been the enemy. Now, with Rizal on the bench, silence was shared space.

"So," Rizal said. "What are you doing in KL? Travelling?"

"Yeah," Connor said. "Travelling."

"How long?"

"Six weeks."

"Six weeks in KL?" Rizal's eyebrows rose. The rise was the expression of mild surprise -- six weeks was a long time for a backpacker in one city, and the surprise was the surprise of a local who understood his city's tourist appeal and knew that most tourists stayed three to five days before moving to Penang or Langkawi or the Cameron Highlands. "That's a lot. Most mat salleh stay a few days."

"I liked it here," Connor said. And the statement was true, or had been true, or was a version of true that contained the core fact without the surrounding circumstances. He had liked KL. He had liked the food. He had liked the heat. He had liked the hostel. He had liked the feeling of being somewhere that was cheap enough and warm enough and alive enough that staying felt easier than leaving, the inertia of a place that was comfortable enough to prevent departure and dangerous enough to eventually demand it.

"Where are you staying? Hotel?"

"Hostel. The Lantern. On Petaling Street."

"I know the Lantern." Rizal nodded. The nod was the nod of local knowledge -- a man who lived in KL and knew its landmarks, its businesses, the geography of a city he inhabited. "Old building, right? Red lanterns. Petaling Street. Near the temple."

"Yeah, that's the one."

"Good location. Cheap. My cousin -- different cousin, not the Melbourne one -- he did some painting work there a few years ago. Old Chinese shophouse. He said the owner was a character."

"Uncle Razak."

"That's the name. With the map. The pins."

Connor felt a flicker of something. Not alarm -- the flicker was fainter than alarm, more subtle, the faint registration of a detail that was either a coincidence or something else. Rizal knew the Lantern. Rizal's cousin had worked there. Rizal knew about Razak's map. The connections were the kind of connections that existed in KL's social fabric -- the city of three million that operated, at the neighbourhood level, like a village, where everyone knew someone who knew someone who had been somewhere and the degrees of separation between any two points in the social network were fewer than the degrees suggested by the city's size.

The flicker passed. The flicker passed because Connor's brain was not operating in the mode that detected flickers -- the brain was operating in the mode that craved connection, that needed conversation, that was running the social programmes at full capacity and allocating its processing power to the production and reception of speech rather than the analysis of anomalies. The brain was starving. The brain was being fed. The brain was not going to question the food.

"So what happened?" Rizal asked. "If you don't mind. Six weeks in KL, nice hostel, and now you're in here. Something went wrong."

The question was gentle -- the fundamental interrogative of the backpacker circuit: *what happened? How did you end up here?* Connor had been asked this question a hundred times in a hundred hostels, but the context was different now. In a hostel the answer was a story. In a cell the answer was a confession.

"It's..." Connor began.

He stopped. The last moment of caution -- *be careful, this is a police station, anything you say can be used as evidence*. But the circuit was weak, weakened by four hours of isolation and the desperate need for human contact, and the idea of stopping the conversation, of returning to the silence, was physically repellant. For Connor, the social need was the survival instinct. Had always been.

"I got in trouble," Connor said. The admission was the crack in the wall through which everything else would flow.

"Drugs?" Rizal said. The word landed soft, almost tender -- not an accusation but the educated guess of a man who understood that foreign nationals in this particular station were, more often than not, here for this particular reason.

Connor nodded.

"Mate," Rizal said -- the word slightly accented, borrowed from the Australian lexicon and adapted to the Malaysian mouth, a bridge. "That's heavy. Like, trafficking heavy? Or possession?"

"Trafficking," Connor said. The word was in the air and could not be retrieved.

Rizal was quiet for five seconds. Long enough to honour the weight of the word and short enough to not leave Connor alone with it.

"How much?" Rizal asked.

"Four hundred and fifty grams."

The number sat between them. Rizal's face changed -- not dramatically, not the theatrical shock of a man performing surprise, but a subtle recalibration, the eyebrows drawing slightly closer, the mouth tightening slightly, the micro-expressions that conveyed recognition of scale. Four hundred and fifty grams was nine times the fifty-gram threshold. Four hundred and fifty grams was not a mistake or an experiment or a personal supply that could be argued down in court. Four hundred and fifty grams was a quantity that the law had no ambiguity about.

"Methamphetamine?" Rizal asked, and the asking was quiet now, the voice lowered, the register shifted from conversational to confessional, the acoustic change that humans made when the subject matter crossed from public to private, from shareable to sensitive.

"Yeah."

"Connor." Rizal shook his head. The head-shake was slow, heavy, the head-shake of a man who understood the implications and was communicating his understanding through the most basic gestural vocabulary available -- the shake that said *this is bad, this is very bad, I understand how bad this is*. "Four fifty. That's... you know what that means in Malaysia?"

"I know now."

"You didn't know before?"

The question was the question that defined Connor's entire story. The question that Priya had asked and Tomoko had implied and Mei Ling had contained in her silences and Mama Siti had buried in her proverbs and Ahmad had been waiting to hear the answer to. *Did you know? Did you know before? When did you know?*

"I didn't know what I was carrying," Connor said. "Not at first. I thought it was..." He paused. The pause was the hesitation of a man on the edge of a longer story, the story that extended backward from this cell to the hostel and from the hostel to the common room and from the common room to the first night and the rooftop and the German with the scar on his eyebrow and the words *I could use someone reliable around here*. "I thought it was phone accessories. Business documents. That kind of thing."

"Someone told you that?"

"Yeah."

"Someone at the hostel?"

"A guy I met there," Connor said. "At the Lantern. He was staying there. He was... he seemed like a mate. He was cool, you know? He knew everyone. He always had money. He bought rounds. He told good stories."

Connor was talking now. The talking had acquired its own momentum -- the momentum of a story that had been contained for hours, for days, for the forty-seven days since the first envelope, the story that had lived inside him as a growing mass of fact and fear and rationalisation, the story that he had never told anyone in its entirety because telling required the dismantling of the machine, the machine that converted warnings into noise and truth into trivia and the word *trafficking* into the word *logistics*. The story wanted out. The story had pressure. The story was like the confession that the police station was designed to extract, except that the police station had not extracted it -- the police station had placed a man on a bench and the man had been warm and interested and available and the warmth and the interest and the availability had done what the cold and the light and the silence could not.

"He was German," Connor said.

"The guy at the hostel?"

"Yeah. German. Older than me. Thirty-one. He had a private room. He was... different from the other backpackers. Polished. Like he had money but wasn't flashy about it. He spoke five languages. He knew KL like a local. He knew where to go, who to talk to, how to get in anywhere."

Rizal listened, body angled slightly toward Connor, head tilted.

"He started asking me to do things," Connor said. "Small things. Carry an envelope to a cafe. Deliver a package to a shop in Brickfields. He said it was business stuff -- import-export, phone accessories, that kind of thing. He paid me. Cash. Two hundred ringgit for the first one. Then five hundred. Then more."

"And you didn't check what was in the packages?"

"No." The word was flat. The word was the confession within the confession, the admission that contained the entire story's moral architecture -- the single syllable that represented every warning ignored, every red flag rationalised, every moment when Connor could have opened a package or asked a question or looked at the thing he was carrying and chosen instead to look away, to not know, to maintain the fiction that ignorance was innocence and that a sealed envelope was just a sealed envelope and that a man who paid cash for deliveries and lived in a private room and wore leather driving gloves was just a generous friend with eczema.

"I didn't check," Connor said. "I didn't want to know. I needed the money and I trusted him and the two things together were enough to stop me from asking questions."

Rizal nodded. The nod was understanding, not judgemental.

"How long?" Rizal asked. "How many deliveries?"

"Six weeks. Dozens. I don't know exactly. It started with envelopes and ended with..." He gestured vaguely, the gesture encompassing the cell and the charge and the suitcase on the highway shoulder. "A suitcase."

"The four fifty was in a suitcase?"

"In the lining. Vacuum-sealed. Sewn in. I was supposed to take a bus to Penang. They got me at a checkpoint on the highway. There was a dog."

"A dog," Rizal repeated. "The K-9 unit."

"Yeah. The dog sat next to the suitcase. And that was it."

"That was it," Rizal echoed. His voice was soft -- not pity but the horizontal sympathy of a person on the same bench, in the same cell, receiving the story as a human story rather than a legal one.

The distinction was also, if Connor had been capable of seeing it, the technique. The professional listener's creation of a non-judgemental space, the calibrated warmth of a man who knew exactly how warm to be. But Connor was not capable of seeing it. Connor was seeing what he needed to see -- a face and a voice and the presence of another human being -- and the need was shaping the perception, the same way it always had.

"This German guy," Rizal said. "At the hostel. He set you up?"

"I don't know if *set up* is the right word. He... groomed me. That's what the police will probably call it. He found me when I was broke. He was nice to me. He gave me easy money. He made the deliveries feel normal. By the time I found out what I was actually carrying, I was already..." He trailed off. The trailing was the verbal equivalent of a man reaching the edge of a cliff and looking down and deciding not to jump but also not turning back, standing on the edge with the void below and the solid ground behind and unable to move in either direction.

"Already in too deep," Rizal finished.

"Yeah."

"CCTV?"

"How did you know about the CCTV?" Connor asked -- the first flicker of something that might have been caution, the brain pausing long enough to register that Rizal had said *CCTV* as though the specific mechanism of Connor's entrapment were obvious. Rizal shrugged. "It's how they do it, isn't it? These rings. They film you so you can't go to the police. My mate -- the one who worked at this station -- he told me about it. It's standard." The explanation was plausible, referencing the same contact who had explained about the cold and the light, and the moment of caution passed because caution would have meant losing the one source of human contact Connor had, and losing that was worse than any risk.

"Yeah, they had me on camera. Every delivery. My face at every location. He showed me the footage. And he said if I went to the police, the footage would be sent to... I don't know. Prosecutors. Media. Everyone. He said I was already in the system and the only way out was to do one more job. The big one. The suitcase."

"And you believed him."

"What choice did I have?"

The question was rhetorical but Rizal answered it anyway. "You could have gone to the police," Rizal said. "Before the suitcase. Before the bus."

"I tried." The admission came out fast, pushed by the pressure of guilt and regret and the specific anguish of a man who had come close enough to salvation to taste it and had turned away. "I called a cop. A narcotics sergeant. Ahmad. He gave me his card weeks ago. I called him twice. Once I got voicemail. Once I got through. I couldn't speak. I just... I couldn't make the words come out."

Rizal was quiet. The quiet had a texture now -- a thicker quiet, a more concentrated quiet, the quiet of a man who was processing information that was, perhaps, more than conversational. The quiet lasted three seconds.

"Ahmad," Rizal said. "Narcotics. Dang Wangi?"

"Yeah. Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail."

"I think I know that name. Serious guy? Forties? Moustache?"

"I don't remember a moustache. But serious, yeah. Very serious."

"That's him. He's known. Tough. By the book." Rizal paused. "He'd have helped you, Connor. If you'd talked to him. He'd have helped."

The statement was a blade. *He'd have helped.* The conditional -- the cruellest tense, the tense that described the world that would have existed if Connor had spoken into the phone instead of hanging up.

"I know," Connor said. "I know he would have."

"The German guy," Rizal said. "You said he was at the hostel. The Lantern. What was his name?"

Connor looked at Rizal. Rizal's face was open, patient, the face of a man who had nowhere else to be. The face was kind. The face was the same kind of face that Felix had worn on the rooftop on the first night -- the face of a man who made you feel chosen.

Connor opened his mouth. And then he spoke. He told Rizal everything.
# Chapter 35: Confession

Connor told Rizal everything.

Not all at once. Not in the ordered, chronological manner of a statement prepared for a courtroom or a letter written to a police sergeant. The telling was organic, disordered, the telling of a man who had been silent for too long and was now unsilent and the unsilencing was not a tap being opened but a dam breaking, the water finding its own channels, flowing where the terrain allowed, accumulating in pools before rushing forward again.

He told Rizal about Felix.

"Felix. His name's Felix Decker. German bloke. Thirty-one, maybe thirty-two. He's at the hostel -- the Lantern, on Petaling Street, third floor, he's got a private room because he's -- he pays for the private room, right? He's been there... eighteen months? Yeah. Eighteen months. And the gloves. He wears these gloves. Leather. I thought it was eczema. He told me eczema and I just -- I just believed him. The gloves are so his fingerprints aren't on the packages. He told me that himself. On the rooftop."

The words came out in a rush, tumbling over each other, the syntax collapsing under the weight of the content, the sentences running together without pause or punctuation because pausing required the breath that Connor couldn't spare and punctuation required the composure that Connor didn't have. The words were the words he should have spoken to Ahmad. The words were the words that Priya had begged him to speak to the embassy. The words were the words that Razak had offered to facilitate, that Tomoko had been waiting to corroborate, that Mama Siti had been watching for. The words had been assembled and ready for weeks, and they were now being spoken, and they were being spoken to the wrong person.

Rizal listened. Rizal's listening was expert -- the listening of a man who understood that the most effective extraction technique was not interrogation but silence, not questions but the absence of questions, the open space that a desperate person rushed to fill. Rizal sat on the steel bench opposite Connor, his back against the concrete wall, his legs crossed at the ankle, his posture relaxed, his expression attentive. He nodded at intervals. He made small sounds of understanding -- "Mm," "Yeah," "Right" -- the acoustic currency of a listener who was engaged but not directing, who was receiving but not steering, who was letting Connor talk because Connor talking was the objective and the objective required no intervention beyond presence.

"He recruited me in the common room," Connor said. "Day 1. My first night. He bought me a beer. He told me travel stories. He was charming -- that's the thing, that's the thing that nobody understands, he was *charming*, he was the most charming person in the building, and the charm was real, it worked, I felt it, I felt chosen, I felt like he'd picked me because I was special, because I was different, because I was the kind of person who deserved a friend like Felix Decker."

He laughed. The laugh was not funny. The laugh was the sound that humans produced when the alternative was the other sound, the sound of breaking, and breaking was not an option yet because there was more to tell and the telling required the structural integrity that breaking would destroy.

"It started with an envelope. Day 6. Just an envelope, sealed, deliver it to a man at a café in Bukit Bintang. Twenty minutes of walking. RM200. I didn't open it. I didn't think about it. The money was good and the task was easy and the person who asked me was my friend and friends asked friends for favours and this was a favour. That's what I told myself. That's what the machine told me."

"The machine?" Rizal said. The question was the first question he'd asked. The question was casual, interested, the question of a man following a story rather than conducting an interrogation.

"In my head. The thing that... rationalises. The thing that takes the evidence and converts it into something manageable. The machine that said the envelopes were business documents and the packages were phone accessories and the backpack was electronics and the charger boxes were chargers. The machine that said *you don't know for certain* every time I almost knew for certain. The machine kept me going. The machine kept me carrying."

He told Rizal about the deliveries. All of them. The envelopes -- three in the first week. The packages -- brown paper, taped, the weight that felt wrong. The contacts: Mr. Tan at the café in Bukit Bintang. Auntie Lim at the shophouse in Jalan Ipoh. Danny at the defunct karaoke bar in Bukit Bintang, Lot 22B. Ah Keat at the nasi kandar restaurant behind Petaling Street.

He told Rizal about the backpack. The red Deuter, six hundred grams to the warehouse in Sentul. The warehouse with the men who weighed packages and sealed them and spoke in Hokkien and didn't look at Connor because looking at the mule was not part of the protocol.

He told Rizal about Wei. The phone repair shop, two doors from the hostel. The back room -- the stainless steel table, the vacuum sealer, the digital scale, the rolls of cling film, the charger boxes that were not charger boxes. Wei's precision. Wei's silence. Wei's function.

He told Rizal about the money. Fourteen thousand ringgit in his bank account. The deposits that couldn't be explained by social media consulting. The money that Priya had seen and questioned and he had deflected.

"Priya," Rizal said. The name registered with the interest of a man who had been listening for names. "Who's Priya?"

"She's... she was at the hostel. British. A medical student. She tried to warn me. She printed the law -- the Dangerous Drugs Act, Section 39B. She put it on my bed. She confronted Felix. She... she's on a plane right now. To London. She has a letter. A letter to the police, to the embassy, to a newspaper. She was going to send it when she landed."

"She's coming back though, yeah? Or she's gone for good?"

Connor calculated. Priya's flight was at eleven thirty last night. A thirteen-hour flight. She would land at Heathrow around five AM London time, which was one PM KL time. It was now -- he looked at the cell, at the absence of a clock, at the fluorescent light that gave no indication of time -- it was now late afternoon, maybe four or five PM. Priya had landed. Priya might have already sent the letter.

"She's already landed," Connor said. "She might have already sent it. To Sergeant Ahmad. Narcotics Division. Here. At this station."

"Ahmad," Rizal said. "You know Ahmad?"

"He gave me his card. At a checkpoint. Bukit Bintang. Weeks ago. He looked at me and said *Malaysia is not a game*. I kept his card. I called him -- twice. The first time I got voicemail. The second time he answered. I couldn't speak. I just... I couldn't."

Rizal nodded. The nodding was slow, thoughtful, the nodding of a man processing information. Behind the nodding, behind the calm exterior, behind the performance of a man listening to a cellmate's story, calculations were being made. The calculations were not Connor's to see. The calculations were the internal process of a man who was tallying names -- Felix Decker, Wei, Mr. Tan, Auntie Lim, Danny, Ah Keat, Priya Sharma, Sergeant Ahmad -- and locations -- the Lantern Hostel, the phone repair shop, the Sentul warehouse, Bukit Bintang, Jalan Ipoh -- and assessments -- a letter in transit, a journalist with photographs, a hostel owner with records, a narcotics officer with a card that connected him to the mule.

The calculations were the network's calculations. The calculations were the risk assessment that the network performed when a mule was caught -- the assessment of what the mule knew, what the mule had said, what the mule might say, and the degree to which the mule's testimony could damage the infrastructure that the network had built over years of operation.

Connor's testimony could damage the infrastructure. Connor's testimony, combined with Priya's letter and Tomoko's photographs and Razak's records and Ahmad's case file, could dismantle the infrastructure. The network's calculation was simple: the mule had to be silenced before the testimony could be delivered.

But Connor didn't know this. Connor was talking because talking was the thing that silence had denied him for forty-seven days, and now silence was over, and the talking was a release, a catharsis, the opening of a valve that had been closed too long. The talking felt good. The talking felt like the thing he should have done on Day 6, on Day 15, on Day 39 when Priya had said *call Ahmad* and he had gone to the rooftop instead. The talking felt like salvation.

The talking was the opposite of salvation. The talking was the mechanism of his destruction.

---

He told Rizal about the suitcase.

"Four hundred and fifty grams. Felix told me. He told me the number. He said it would pass a visual inspection and an X-ray but not a dog. He said Fridays were usually quiet. He said *usually*."

"Usually," Rizal repeated. The word sat between them in the fluorescent light.

"There was a checkpoint. Between Tapah and Ipoh. Two checkpoints, actually. The first one was routine -- three officers, no dog. Waved through. The second one had dogs. Two dogs. German shepherds. The dog went along the luggage compartment and stopped at my suitcase and sat down. The handler said *positif*. And that was it. That was the end."

He paused. The pause was not for effect but for breath, the body's insistence on the mechanical requirement of oxygen even while the mind was operating at a level that made oxygen feel irrelevant.

"They opened the suitcase on the highway shoulder. Cut the lining. Found five vacuum bags. Tested the contents. Blue. Positive for methamphetamine. They arrested me. Read me my rights. Put me in a car. Drove me here."

"To Ahmad's station," Rizal said.

"To Ahmad's station. Yeah. The irony isn't lost on me."

Rizal looked at Connor. Something shifted -- not in his expression, which remained attentive and calm, but in the architecture beneath it, the way a building settles on its foundations when a load is added and the settling is invisible but the structure knows. Rizal uncrossed his legs. The movement was small, unhurried, but the new posture was different from the old posture in a way that Connor did not register: the old posture was the posture of listening, of a body arranged for the purpose of absorbing information, and the new posture was the posture of a body that had absorbed enough and was rearranging itself for the next function. Rizal's hands, which had been resting loosely on his knees, moved to the bench on either side of his thighs, the fingers curling around the steel edge, the grip light but present, the grip of a man who was no longer a listener but something else. His questions, in the last minutes of Connor's telling, had become fractionally more precise -- "Ahmad, you said? Narcotics Division?" and "The letter -- she was sending it to Ahmad specifically?" and "The journalist -- she had photographs of Felix?" -- the questions arriving with the focused economy of a man who was no longer following a story but confirming an inventory, ticking items off a list that existed somewhere behind his calm, attentive eyes. The fluorescent light caught those eyes and for a moment -- less than a moment, a fraction of a second that Connor would never consciously recall -- there was something in them that had not been there before. Not menace. Not cruelty. Certainty. The specific, settled certainty of a professional who had confirmed what he needed to confirm and now knew the shape of what came next.

The look was the look of a man who had heard enough. Not enough as in sufficient for a conversation, but enough as in sufficient for a purpose, the purpose that Rizal's presence in this cell served, the purpose that Connor didn't know and wouldn't know until the purpose was enacted.

"Better you rest, brother. Long day already," Rizal said.

"I can't sleep."

"Try. Lie down. Use your towel as a pillow. The bench is shit but it's better than the floor."

Connor looked at the bench. The steel surface was cold and hard and the bench was designed not for comfort but for containment, the minimum accommodation that the system provided to the bodies it held. He lay down. The bench was short -- his legs hung off the end, his knees bent. He folded the blue towel and placed it under his head. The towel was soft against his scalp. The microfiber compressed to a thin cushion. The towel smelled of sunscreen and the faint, chemical scent of hostel soap and the accumulated olfactory memory of twelve countries.

He closed his eyes. The fluorescent light buzzed behind his eyelids, the light penetrating the thin skin, the darkness not complete but red -- the colour of blood seen from behind the lid, the colour of the world when you closed your eyes in a room that never went dark.

Rizal sat on the opposite bench. Rizal did not close his eyes. Rizal watched Connor with the steady, patient attention of a man waiting for sleep to arrive, the way a hunter waited for prey to settle, the patience that was not idleness but preparation, the stillness that preceded action.

The cell was quiet. The fluorescent light buzzed. The disinfectant smell was constant -- the chemical signature of a space that was cleaned with industrial products by people who cleaned without care, the cleaning a function rather than an act, the function maintaining the minimum standard of hygiene that the system required.

---

Connor didn't sleep. He drifted -- the shallow, incomplete drift that existed between wakefulness and sleep, the state in which the mind produced fragments rather than dreams, the fragments assembling and disassembling with the random, kaleidoscopic logic of a consciousness that was too exhausted to organise itself but too afraid to surrender.

The fragments were memories.

His mother's kitchen. The yellow curtains. The Vegemite jar with the red lid. The morning light coming through the window above the sink, the light that fell on the counter in a rectangle that moved as the sun moved, the slow clock of domestic life.

His father's hand on his shoulder at the airport. "The rules don't care who you are." The hand heavy and warm and the weight of it carrying the authority of a man who knew something about the world that his son didn't know and was trying to communicate it through a palm and five fingers and the pressure of a grip that said *please listen*.

Priya's face at the hawker stall. The first time. Her glasses reflecting the stall's fluorescent light (the light -- always the light, the fluorescent light in every memory now, the light contaminating the past the way the drugs had contaminated his luggage). Her expression: amused, sharp, the face of a woman encountering a specimen she found irritating and interesting in equal measure.

Felix in the common room. The beer. The stories. The scar on the eyebrow. The linen shirt. The charm that was a weapon. The smile that was a tool. The word *reliable*. "I could use someone reliable around here." The word that had opened the door, the first door, the door that led to all the other doors.

The fragments cycled. The kitchen. The airport. The hawker stall. The common room. The envelope. The package. The backpack. The charger box. The suitcase. The dog. The handcuffs. The cell. The light.

The light.

Always the light. The fluorescent tube on the ceiling of the cell, the tube that buzzed and hummed and cast its flat, blue-white illumination on everything -- the walls, the bench, the toilet, the towel, the two men, the air. The light was the cell's defining feature. The light was the thing that made the cell different from every other space Connor had occupied -- not the bars, which were expected, not the concrete, which was expected, but the light, which was unexpected in its permanence, in its refusal to turn off, in the message that its permanence conveyed: *there is no night here, there is no rest, there is no darkness to hide in, there is only this -- this light, this buzzing, this brightness that reveals everything and conceals nothing*.

He opened his eyes. The light was there. The light was always there.

Rizal was watching him. Rizal's eyes were open, steady, the eyes reflecting the fluorescent light in two small points, the eyes of a man who had not slept and did not intend to.

"What time is it?" Connor said.

"Late. Maybe ten. Maybe eleven."

"How do you know?"

"The shift change. The guards. You hear the doors. The evening shift ends at ten. The night shift starts."

Connor listened. The sounds of the station were distant but present -- the muffled rhythm of a building that operated on a schedule, the opening and closing of doors, the footsteps in corridors, the occasional voice. The sounds were the sounds of a system running, the bureaucratic machinery of a police station performing its nightly transition from day operations to night operations, the change of personnel, the change of rhythm, the change from the brisk efficiency of daylight hours to the slower, quieter tempo of the night.

A sound at the cell door -- metal on metal, the scrape of the observation slot sliding open. A rectangle of light appeared in the door at eye level, the light from the corridor brighter than the cell's fluorescent tube, sharp-edged and briefly blinding. A face filled the rectangle: a guard, new, not the one who had processed Connor. The night-shift officer. His face was the face of a man four hours into a shift that would last until six AM -- the eyes carrying the particular fatigue of institutional boredom, the mouth set in the neutral expression of a person performing a task he had performed a thousand times, the check a function rather than an investigation, the eyes moving without searching, seeing without analysing. The guard's gaze swept the cell -- two prisoners, one lying down, one sitting -- and found nothing that required action, and the observation slot scraped shut, and the rectangle of corridor light vanished, and the cell was again sealed in its own fluorescent universe.

On the opposite bench, Rizal's eyes tracked the slot as it closed. The tracking was brief -- a flick of attention -- but in the moment after the slot shut, Rizal's right hand moved. The movement was nearly invisible: his index finger extended from the loose fist resting on his thigh and tapped once, softly, against the steel bench. A single tap. The tap of a man marking a timestamp. Then the finger curled back into the fist and the hand was still and the movement was over and it had meant nothing, or it had meant everything, and the difference between nothing and everything was a difference that Connor, lying with his eyes half-closed, could not perceive.

Footsteps. Receding. A door, distant, opening and closing. Then the corridor was silent, the guard absorbed into the station's nighttime architecture, gone.

"Night shift," Rizal said. "One guard for the whole block. Checks every hour. Maybe every forty minutes if he's keen. Maybe every ninety if he's not."

"How do you know?"

"You hear the pattern. First check is always prompt -- the new shift, the fresh guard, the supervisor maybe still around. After that it loosens. The gaps get wider. By two, three AM..." He made a gesture with his hand, an opening, a spreading, the gesture of a man describing the natural expansion of unsupervised time. "The station is quiet. The guard has a desk somewhere. A phone. Earbuds. Maybe a game, maybe a show. Six hours of checking cells and paperwork and the boredom that is the specific boredom of a man who is employed to watch other men sit in rooms. The boredom wins. It always wins."

The information was delivered casually, conversationally, with the warm tone of a man sharing institutional wisdom with a newcomer -- *this is how it works, this is what to expect, this is how the night will go*. The information was comforting. But the information was also reconnaissance -- Rizal was narrating the security environment, mapping the intervals between checks, calculating the window of unobserved time that would open in the hours ahead, the way a professional assessed a space before operating in it. Every detail -- the guard's routine, the loosening intervals, the desk and the earbuds and the boredom -- was a variable in an equation that Connor could not see, an equation whose solution was a span of uninterrupted minutes sometime between two and four AM, a span long enough for the task that Rizal's presence in this cell had been arranged to accomplish.

Connor didn't hear the reconnaissance. Connor heard a man who knew about police stations, who understood the system, who could help navigate the long, terrifying night ahead.

"I need to talk to someone," Connor said. He sat up on the bench. "Ahmad. Sergeant Ahmad. Narcotics Division. He's in this building -- this building, this station, Dang Wangi. He gave me his card. He looked at me at a checkpoint and he knew, he *knew*, he could see it, and he said *Malaysia is not a game* and he gave me his card because he was giving me a chance, and I didn't take it, and I need to take it now. If I can talk to him--"

He was rehearsing it already, the speech assembling itself in his mouth, the words that Priya had helped him research in those desperate final days at the hostel -- the legal terminology she had found on the Malaysian Bar Council website, the phrases she had underlined in her precise handwriting on the printout she'd left on his bed. *I am a cooperating witness. I wish to make a voluntary statement under Section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Code. I have information regarding a drug trafficking network operating in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. I can identify the handler, the supplier, the distribution contacts, and the locations of operation. I am requesting consideration under Section 39C, which provides for reduced sentencing in exchange for cooperation with the prosecution.* The words were legal, formal, the words of a system that Connor had spent his entire adult life refusing to engage with, the words that were now, in this cell, under this light, the only words that might save his life. He had memorised them, refined the delivery during the hours on the bench, imagining Ahmad's face as he listened -- the stern, professional face softening into the expression of an officer who recognised that the boy in front of him was not a trafficker but a fool, a useful fool who could bring down something larger, and the recognition would be the beginning of the process that would transform Connor from a prisoner into a witness, from a dead man into a living one.

The hope was enormous. The hope filled every cubic centimetre of the fluorescent air and the hope was built on the belief that Ahmad -- the man who had stood on a Bukit Bintang pavement and looked at Connor with the eyes of someone who had seen a hundred Connors -- would listen, would intercede, would reach into the machinery of the Dangerous Drugs Act and pull Connor out before the machinery did what machinery did. The hope was desperate and irrational and it was all Connor had, and he held it the way a drowning man held a plank, with the full, white-knuckled grip of a body that understood the alternative to holding was sinking.

"In the morning," Rizal said.

The words were gentle. But beneath the gentleness there was something else -- something in the fractional pause between "the" and "morning," a pause so small that only a machine calibrated for such measurements could have detected it: the pause fractionally longer than the words required, as though "in the morning" were not a promise but a sedative, a verbal anaesthetic administered to keep the patient still and cooperative in the hours remaining.

"Tonight nobody is coming, lah. Morning, they come," Rizal continued.

The morning. Everything was the morning. The embassy was the morning. The lawyer was the morning. Ahmad was the morning. The morning was the boundary between the night and the process, between the cell and the system's official response, between the waiting and the acting. The morning was twelve hours away. The morning was the thing that Connor had to survive to reach.

He pulled the blue towel tighter around his shoulders. The towel was warm now -- warmed by his body, the microfiber absorbing his heat and reflecting it back, the thermal loop of a body trying to comfort itself with its own warmth. The towel was the only soft thing in the cell. The bench was steel. The walls were concrete. The bars were iron. The towel was the exception -- the one material that yielded, that gave, that pressed against his skin with the quality of something that was not trying to contain him.

He thought about the morning. The guard would come at six, or seven. The day shift would begin. Connor would stand at the bars and say the words -- *I am a cooperating witness, I wish to make a voluntary statement* -- and the words would travel through the system the way signals travelled through wires, from the guard to the desk officer to Ahmad, and Ahmad would come, and Ahmad would listen, and the listening would be the beginning of something that was not this cell, this light, this night.

The words were ready. The words had been ready for weeks. The words would be spoken in the morning. The morning was the thing he had to reach.

He closed his eyes again. The light persisted behind his eyelids. The light was permanent. The light was the condition of the cell, the condition of the night, the condition of the last night of Connor Briggs's life, though he didn't know that yet, though the not-knowing was the last mercy the universe would extend.

Rizal sat across from him. Rizal's eyes were open. Rizal was watching. Rizal was waiting.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The cell was quiet. The station was quiet. And somewhere outside, somewhere in the city, the late call to prayer rose from a mosque and reached through concrete and distance and the acoustic barriers of institutional architecture and arrived in the cell as a faint, ghostly thread of sound, the muezzin's voice carrying the words that had been spoken five times a day for fourteen centuries, the words that called the faithful to prayer, the words that Connor heard without understanding, without responding, without knowing that the words were the last beautiful thing he would hear.

The night continued. The light buzzed. The towel was warm.

And the man across the cell sat with his eyes open and his hands on the bench edge and his body still.
# Chapter 36: Meanwhile

At 1:07 PM Malaysian time, while Connor Briggs sat in the back of a police vehicle travelling south on the North-South Expressway with his wrists in handcuffs, AirAsia flight D7 2 touched down at London Heathrow Terminal 4.

The aircraft rolled to Gate 23. The seatbelt sign turned off. The cabin filled with the sound of four hundred people simultaneously unbuckling, standing, opening overhead bins, reaching for bags, performing the choreographed chaos of arrival. Priya Sharma, seat 34A, window, waited. She waited because the aisle was blocked and because waiting was what she had been doing for eleven hours and forty-seven minutes, waiting while the aircraft carried her over the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean and the Middle East and Europe, waiting while the Earth turned beneath her and the time zones unwound and the night that had started in Kuala Lumpur became morning over the Arabian Sea and the morning became dawn over England and the dawn was grey, and the journey was the cruelty, because the night had not ended, the night that had begun with nasi lemak and a kiss and a red suitcase in a Grab and the word *embassy* spoken through a car window was still the same night stretched across thirteen hours of sky, and the night was not over, and the things that the night contained were still happening.

She disembarked. She walked through the jetway. She entered Heathrow.

Heathrow was grey. Not the grey of Malaysia's rain clouds -- not the thick, textured grey that preceded tropical downpours. This was the grey of England in February, the grey that was not a weather event but a condition, the permanent, low-frequency grey that sat on the country like a lid, the grey that entered your bones and your mood and your relationship with daylight and made you understand, viscerally, why the British had colonised the tropics.

Immigration. The queue. The e-gates. Priya's British passport scanned. The gate opened. She was home. The word *home* was a physical sensation -- the particular relief of a body re-entering the jurisdiction that protected it, the borders that defined it, the system that recognised it as a citizen rather than a visitor. She was safe. The safety was real and concrete and she could feel it in her shoulders, which dropped, and her jaw, which unclenched, and her hands, which stopped gripping the handle of the red suitcase with the white-knuckled intensity that they'd maintained since KLIA2.

Baggage claim. The carousel. The red suitcase appeared -- dented, scratched, familiar. She grabbed it. She walked through the green channel. Nothing to declare.

She had everything to declare.

In the arrivals hall, she found a Costa Coffee. She ordered a flat white -- the first English coffee in six weeks, the taste of it, after weeks of kopi and teh tarik and the rich, dark, condensed-milk Malaysian brew, startlingly bland, almost apologetic, the coffee of a country that had colonised the coffee-producing world without ever learning to make coffee.

She sat. She opened her laptop. She connected to the airport wifi.

She opened the document. The letter. The letter she had written in Dorm 4 during a sleepless night, the letter that contained everything she knew about Felix Decker and his operation at the Lantern Hostel, the letter that named names and described routes and quantified amounts and provided the timeline of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian man's recruitment and exploitation and destruction.

The letter was addressed to four recipients:

1. Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur
2. Australian High Commission, Kuala Lumpur
3. The Star, Malaysia (news desk)
4. Tomoko Sato (personal email)

Priya read the letter one final time. The reading took four minutes. The letter was thorough -- the thoroughness of a medical student who understood that evidence required specificity, that claims required documentation, that a letter to a police officer needed to be written with the precision of a diagnosis rather than the passion of a plea.

She pressed send.

The email left her laptop and entered the infrastructure of the internet -- the wifi router, the airport's network, the servers, the cables, the routing protocols that carried digital information across the world at the speed of light. The email reached its recipients in less than a second. The email sat in four inboxes -- a police inbox, a diplomatic inbox, a newspaper inbox, a personal inbox -- waiting to be opened, waiting to be read, waiting to activate the responses that each recipient would produce.

The email sat. The inboxes were not checked immediately. Ahmad was not at his desk. The Australian High Commission's consular duty officer was at lunch. The Star's news desk was processing the day's stories. Tomoko was in the common room of the Lantern Hostel, waiting for exactly this email.

Priya closed the laptop. She drank the flat white. She looked at the arrivals hall -- the grey, the crowd, the Englishness of it all. She looked at her phone. No messages from Connor. No missed calls. The silence from his phone was not unusual -- Connor's relationship with his phone was intermittent, the phone used for Instagram and texts to his mother and the burner phone's instructions and not much else. The silence could mean he was at the embassy. The silence could mean he was safe.

The silence could mean other things. Priya did not allow herself to think about the other things. Not yet. Not in the arrivals hall of Heathrow, with the flat white and the grey light and the letter sent. Not yet.

She stood. She collected the red suitcase. She walked to the Piccadilly Line entrance. She would go to her flat in Bermondsey. She would shower. She would call her parents in Ealing. She would wait for a response to the letter. She would wait for Connor to call.

She descended into the Underground. The escalator carried her down. The warm, stale air of the Tube rose to meet her -- the ancient, particular smell of the London Underground, the smell of brake dust and electricity and the accumulated breath of a million daily passengers. The smell of home.

The smell of a city twelve thousand kilometres from a cell where a man she loved was sitting under a fluorescent light with a blue towel around his shoulders, waiting for a morning that would not save him.

At 2:15 PM Malaysian time, Tomoko Sato opened Priya's email on her laptop in the common room of the Lantern Hostel.

She read it quickly. The reading took two minutes. The letter confirmed what Tomoko already knew -- the facts, the names, the amounts, the timeline. The letter was the text that accompanied Tomoko's photographs, the narrative that gave context to the images she had been collecting since her second week at the hostel, the images that were stored on a server in Tokyo, backed up and encrypted, the images that showed Felix Decker entering and exiting Wei's phone repair shop, that showed Connor carrying packages, that showed the digital scale through Wei's window, that showed the operational infrastructure of a drug trafficking network operating out of a hostel in Chinatown.

Tomoko closed the email. She opened her own email client. She had a draft prepared -- a draft she had been refining for three weeks, the draft of an email to the news desk of The Star, Malaysia's largest English-language newspaper. The email contained:

1. A summary of her findings
2. Twelve photographs with metadata
3. A link to a secure folder containing an additional forty-seven photographs
4. The names Felix Decker, Wei, and the Lantern Hostel
5. A reference to Priya's letter as corroborating documentation

She added a line to the email: *The mule -- Connor Briggs, Australian -- was arrested today on the North-South Expressway. He is currently in custody. Time is critical.*

She pressed send.

The email left the hostel's wifi and joined the digital stream. The email reached The Star's news desk at 2:16 PM. The email sat in a queue behind thirty-seven other emails. The queue would be processed by a junior editor named Aisha who was currently at the mamak stall next to the newspaper's offices, eating roti canai and drinking teh tarik, unaware that the email in her queue would become the most significant piece of investigative journalism her desk had handled in six months.

Tomoko closed her laptop. She looked around the common room. The common room was empty -- the afternoon lull, the time between checkout and the evening social hour. The ceiling fan turned. The red lanterns glowed. The building was quiet.

She went to reception. Mei Ling was there.

"The letter has been sent," Tomoko said.

Mei Ling nodded. The nod was small, contained, the nod of a woman who had been waiting for this moment and was now processing its arrival not with relief but with the complicated, ambivalent emotion of a person who understood that the letter's sending was the beginning of a process that would expose not just Felix's network but the hostel's complicity, not just the handler but the building that had housed him, not just the crime but the arrangement that had allowed the crime to occur.

"Uncle Razak?" Tomoko asked.

"Upstairs. He's been on the phone all day. Calling Ahmad. Calling his lawyer. Calling people." Mei Ling paused. "He couldn't reach Ahmad."

"Ahmad's not answering?"

"The desk says he's out. Field work. He'll be back in the morning."

The morning. The word again. The word that had been the answer to every question Connor had asked in the cell -- embassy tomorrow, lawyer tomorrow, Ahmad tomorrow. The word that was the system's temporal boundary, the line between the night and the action, the line that everything depended on.

Tomoko looked at the clock behind reception. 2:23 PM. The morning was seventeen hours away.

"Is that enough time?" she asked.

Mei Ling looked at her. The question was not about time. The question was about whether the system -- the letter, the photographs, the records, the people who had assembled the evidence and sent it through the channels and were now waiting for the channels to process it -- whether the system could deliver its output before a different system, the system that Felix controlled, the system that silenced mules who talked, delivered its own output.

"I don't know," Mei Ling said.

The honesty was not comforting. The honesty was the honesty of a woman who had worked in a building where things happened that she could not prevent, where warnings were issued and ignored and the ignoring led to consequences that the warnings had predicted. The honesty was the honesty of a woman who had filed checkout forms for guests who had left the building alive and who had filed other forms for guests who had not.

Tomoko went back to the common room. She sat on the sofa. She opened her laptop. She checked her email. No response from The Star. No response from Priya. No response from anyone.

The ceiling fan turned. The common room was quiet. The hostel waited.

At 3:30 PM, Uncle Razak called Dang Wangi for the fourth time.

"I need to speak to Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail. Narcotics Division. It's urgent."

"Sergeant Ahmad is not available. He will be in the office tomorrow morning."

"Tomorrow morning may be too late. There is a prisoner in your custody -- an Australian man, Connor Briggs, arrested today on the North-South Expressway with methamphetamine. I have information relevant to his case. Information about the trafficking network. Names. Evidence."

"I can take a message, encik."

"A message is not enough. I need to speak to someone in Narcotics tonight. The prisoner is in danger."

"In danger, encik?"

"The network he was working for has contacts within the police. The prisoner will be silenced if he is not protected. I am telling you this on the record. My name is Razak bin Abdullah. I own the Lantern Hostel, 28 Jalan Petaling. I have information. I need to speak to someone tonight."

A pause. The pause was the pause of a desk officer receiving information that exceeded his authority to process, the information that required a decision by someone above him in the chain of command, the decision that would determine whether the call was escalated or filed.

"I will transfer you to the duty officer."

Hold music. The hold music was a tinny, synthesised version of a Malay folk song, the kind of music that played in government offices and call centres and the telephonic limbo of institutions that operated on their own schedule regardless of the urgency of the caller's need.

The hold lasted four minutes. Then: "Duty Officer, Sergeant Hamid."

Razak repeated everything. The names. The evidence. The danger. The request for protection.

Sergeant Hamid listened. Sergeant Hamid was not Ahmad. Sergeant Hamid was a duty officer on a Friday afternoon, processing calls, managing the station's operational queue, allocating resources based on the station's priorities. The station's priorities on a Friday afternoon were: the evening operations, the Changkat Bukit Bintang patrol, the immigration checks, the traffic operations. A hostel owner's claim that a prisoner was in danger was a claim that required verification, investigation, the involvement of the relevant division -- Narcotics, Ahmad's division -- and the relevant division was unavailable until morning.

"I have noted your call, Encik Razak. I will ensure Sergeant Ahmad receives the message first thing in the morning. The prisoner is in our custody and is safe."

"You don't understand--"

"The prisoner is in our custody, encik. He is safe. Ahmad will contact you in the morning. Selamat petang."

The line went dead.

Razak put the phone down. He was in his office, behind reception, the door closed. The map of deaths was on the wall. The red pins. The newspaper clippings. The collected record of guests who had died in hostels and guesthouses, the record that he had maintained for seventeen years with the obsessive attention of a man who believed that documentation was a form of prevention, that recording the pattern was the first step to breaking it.

The pattern was not broken. The pattern was repeating. The pattern was a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in a cell at Dang Wangi, and the system that should have protected him -- the letter, the photographs, the phone calls, the evidence that had been assembled by a British medical student and a Japanese journalist and a Malaysian hostel owner and a receptionist and a cook -- the system had delivered its inputs and the inputs were in queues and the queues were being processed at the speed of bureaucracy, which was the speed of humans working within institutions, which was the speed of morning, which was tomorrow.

Tomorrow. Seventeen hours. The night shift had started at Dang Wangi. One guard for the cell block. The guard would check every hour. Maybe.

Razak looked at the map. He looked at the space where Kuala Lumpur was. He looked at the red pins that already existed in the city -- three, from previous years, previous hostels, previous deaths. He did not have a pin for the Lantern Hostel. He had never placed a pin for his own building. The absence of a pin was the thing he had been guarding for thirty years, the clean record, the building that hosted and released, that checked guests in and checked them out, that did not appear on the map of the dead.

He sat in his office. He looked at the map. The map looked back.

And in a cell at Dang Wangi, three kilometres away, a man wrapped in a blue towel was lying on a steel bench while a man named Rizal sat across from him and the fluorescent light buzzed and the night shift guard settled into his chair and put in his earbuds and opened his phone and began the long, quiet process of not paying attention to the things that happened in cells during the hours when no one was watching.

At 4:45 PM, in Melbourne, Australia, Karen Briggs was making dinner.

She was in the kitchen -- the kitchen in Hawthorn, the kitchen with the yellow curtains and the Vegemite jar and the window that overlooked the garden. The garden where, unbeknownst to her, a man with a phone had stood two days ago and photographed her through the glass.

She was making a shepherd's pie. David's favourite. David was in the living room watching the cricket, his health improved, his colour better than it had been for weeks, the scare of two months ago receding into the category of things that had been frightening but were now manageable. The cricket was Australia versus India, a Test match at the MCG, and David was calling out the scores in the way that men called out cricket scores to kitchens -- assuming the kitchen was interested, assuming the kitchen was listening, the monologue of a man speaking to a room.

Karen was listening. She was also thinking about Connor.

She thought about Connor most evenings. The thinking was not anxious -- not the acute, focused anxiety of a mother who suspected something specific. The thinking was the background radiation of a mother whose child was far away, the low-frequency concern that lived in the base of the skull and activated at quiet moments, at the moments between tasks, at the moments when the hands were busy with a pie but the mind was free to wander and the wandering took it to KL, to the hostel she'd seen on Instagram, to the face of her son in the photographs he posted -- the sunburn, the smile, the settings that she couldn't identify but that looked warm and bright and far from Hawthorn.

*Are you eating well? Please call soon.*

She had sent the text days ago. He had replied. He had said he'd call Sunday. He had not called Sunday. The not-calling was not unusual -- Connor's relationship with phone calls was the relationship of a generation that texted rather than talked, that communicated in captions rather than conversations. The not-calling worried her in the way that all of Connor's absences worried her, which was mildly, constantly, the worry of a woman who had raised a child to be independent and was now experiencing the consequence of that independence, which was distance.

She put the shepherd's pie in the oven. She set the timer. She wiped the counter. She looked at the kitchen clock. Four forty-five PM in Melbourne was 1:45 PM in KL -- she had learned the time difference, had memorised it the way mothers memorised the things that connected them to absent children, the eight-hour gap that placed Connor's morning in her evening and his evening in her morning, the temporal distance that was smaller than the physical distance but felt larger because it meant they were never in the same part of the day.

She did not know that her son was in a cell. She did not know that the cell was at Dang Wangi. She did not know that the cell contained a man named Rizal who was not in for a bar fight. She did not know that the blue towel she had packed in his bag eighteen months ago at this very kitchen counter, folding it carefully, placing it in the side pocket, saying "Don't forget sunscreen" -- she did not know that the towel was in the cell with him, that the towel would be the last thing he felt, that the towel she had packed was the instrument that had been placed in the cell for a purpose that was not comfort.

She put the kettle on. She would make tea. She would sit with David. She would watch the cricket. She would wait for Sunday, when Connor had promised to call, and Sunday would come, and the call would not, and the not-calling would shift from mild concern to something else, something that arrived the following Tuesday at 3 AM Melbourne time as a phone call from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, a phone call that began with the words "Mrs. Briggs, I'm calling about your son Connor" and ended with a sound that Karen would never forget, the sound of a mother learning the thing that no mother should learn, delivered in the measured, professional tone of a consular official who had made this kind of call before and would make it again and had been trained to deliver the information in a specific way that was clear and compassionate and completely, utterly insufficient.

But that was Tuesday. This was Friday. And on Friday at 4:45 PM, Karen Briggs put the kettle on and waited for it to boil and thought about her son in the mild, constant way of mothers everywhere, and the kitchen was warm, and the cricket was on, and the shepherd's pie was in the oven, and the world was ordinary, and the ordinary was a mercy that would not last.

At 10:00 PM Malaysian time, in the cell at Dang Wangi, the night shift guard completed his first round.

The guard's name was Hafiz. He was twenty-six. He had been in the PDRM for three years, assigned to Dang Wangi for eighteen months, assigned to the night shift for the past six because the night shift was where junior officers were placed, the hours that senior officers avoided, the shift that ran from ten PM to six AM and required the ability to stay awake through the quietest hours of a building that spent its nights in a state of reduced animation, the cells occupied, the corridors empty, the sounds muffled.

Hafiz walked the cell block. Eight cells. Three occupied. Cell 1: a Malaysian man arrested for assault, sleeping. Cell 3: two men arrested for theft, one sleeping, one staring at the ceiling. Cell 7: two men -- a foreigner, Australian, arrested for drug trafficking, lying on the bench wrapped in a towel; and a Malaysian man, bar fight, sitting on the opposite bench, awake.

Hafiz looked through the observation slot of Cell 7. The foreigner was lying down. The Malaysian was sitting. Both were still. Hafiz noted the observation on his log -- a paper log, the physical record that the system required, the handwritten entry that would later be examined by investigators and journalists and lawyers as evidence of what had happened and when.

*22:00 -- Cell 7: Two inmates. Quiet. No issues.*

Hafiz returned to the duty desk. The desk was at the end of the corridor, separated from the cells by a steel door and a short hallway. From the desk, the cells were not visible -- the corridor turned, the architecture of the building placing a wall between the guard and the prisoners, the wall that was a design flaw or a design feature depending on who was doing the assessing.

Hafiz sat at the desk. He put in his earbuds. He opened his phone. He had eight hours until the end of his shift. Eight hours of cells and logs and the corridor and the desk and the fluorescent light and the silence.

He pressed play on a video. The video was a football highlights compilation. The sound of the crowd and the commentator's voice filled his ears. The cells were quiet. The building was quiet. The night was long.

At 10:47 PM, his phone buzzed. A message from a number he didn't recognise.

*Cell 7. Bathroom break. 40 minutes. RM5,000.*

Hafiz looked at the message. The message was clear. The message was an instruction. The message was accompanied by, he discovered when he opened his banking app, a pending transfer of RM5,000 from an account he didn't recognise.

He looked at the corridor. He looked at the cells. He looked at the message.

RM5,000 was two months' salary. RM5,000 was the deposit on the flat his girlfriend had been asking about. RM5,000 was the answer to a question that the night shift's salary did not provide.

At 11:15 PM, Guard Hafiz stood from the duty desk. He walked past the cells. He did not look through the observation slots. He opened the door at the end of the corridor. He walked through. The door closed behind him.

The cell block was unguarded.

In Cell 7, Rizal heard the door close. He heard the silence that followed -- the specific, complete silence of a space that was no longer watched, no longer attended, the silence that was not empty but loaded, the silence that preceded action.

Rizal stood.

The fluorescent light buzzed.
# Chapter 37: The Blue Towel

Rizal stood.

The movement was small. The movement was the transition from sitting to standing, the simple mechanical act of legs straightening and a body rising from a bench, the act that every human performed a hundred times a day without thought or deliberation. But the movement changed the cell. The movement changed the air. The movement changed the relationship between the two bodies in the space -- from the horizontal and the vertical, from the lying and the sitting, from the configuration of rest to the configuration of something else.

Connor opened his eyes.

He had not been sleeping. The not-sleeping was the state he'd occupied for hours -- the shallow, buzzing drift between consciousness and its absence, the state where the body lay still and the mind ran and the two existed in the same space without cooperation, the body wanting rest and the mind refusing it, the mind cycling through the same corridors, the same rooms, the same questions, the same unanswerable facts.

He opened his eyes and saw Rizal standing.

"You okay?" Connor said. The question was automatic, the reflex of a person who noticed another person's movement and responded with the social currency of concern. The question was asked from the bench, from the horizontal, from the position of a man lying down and looking up at a man standing.

Rizal didn't answer.

The not-answering was the first wrong thing. Rizal had answered everything -- every question, every observation, every fragment of conversation that Connor had produced during the hours of their confinement. Rizal had been the answering machine, the responsive surface, the voice that met every voice. The silence was new. The silence was different. The silence was the sound of a function ending and another function beginning.

Connor sat up. The sitting up was the movement of a body responding to a change in the environment, the instinct to be vertical when the situation demanded alertness. He sat on the bench. The blue towel fell from his shoulders to the bench surface, the microfiber pooling on the steel in a soft blue heap.

Rizal was standing between the two benches. The cell was small -- three metres by three. The benches ran along opposite walls. The space between them was less than a metre. Rizal was in that space, standing, his body filling the gap between the benches, his shadow cast on the wall by the fluorescent light.

"Rizal?"

Rizal moved.

The movement was fast. Not the fast of panic or the fast of anger but the fast of competence, the fast of a body that had rehearsed this motion and was now performing it with the mechanical efficiency of repetition. Rizal's right hand reached down. His fingers closed around the blue towel on the bench. The towel came up. The towel moved through the air in a single, fluid arc -- from the bench to Connor's neck.

Connor's brain registered the towel's movement approximately 200 milliseconds before the towel reached his throat. The 200 milliseconds was not enough time to move. The 200 milliseconds was enough time to begin to understand -- to begin to process the visual information of a man's hand holding a towel and the towel's trajectory describing the geometry of what was about to happen. The understanding arrived incomplete. The understanding was a fragment, a partial image, a half-formed thought that started with *why is he* and ended nowhere because the towel reached his neck.

The towel went around his throat from behind. Rizal had moved -- in the same motion, the same economy of movement, he had stepped to Connor's side and then behind him, the footwork of a man who knew the choreography, who had performed this choreography before, who understood that the approach was from behind, always from behind, because the front presented too many variables -- hands, arms, the unpredictability of a face-to-face confrontation.

The towel pulled tight.

The sensation was not what Connor expected. He had no expectation -- the event was too sudden, too discontinuous from the previous state, the transition from lying on a bench to being strangled too large for the mind to prepare for. But if he had expected something, he might have expected pain, the sharp pain of a thin ligature cutting into flesh, the pain of rope or wire or the hard edge of a cord.

The towel did not cut. The towel compressed. The microfiber was wide -- the full width of the towel, folded once, creating a band of fabric approximately five centimetres across. The band pressed against his throat not as a line but as a surface, the pressure distributed across the front and sides of his neck, the compression even, the effect not a cut but a squeeze, the closing of the airway not by penetration but by external pressure, the trachea pressed flat by the soft, smooth, terribly efficient fabric of a Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel.

Connor's hands flew to his neck. The movement was involuntary -- the body's first and most powerful response to strangulation, the hands reaching for the ligature, the fingers trying to find purchase, to hook under the fabric, to create space between the towel and the throat, to restore the airflow that had been cut off.

His fingers found the towel. His fingers could not grip it.

The microfiber was smooth. That was its design. That was the engineering that made it a good travel towel -- the tight weave, the smooth surface, the fabric that dried fast because water couldn't cling to it, the fabric that packed small because the fibres were flat and dense. The same properties that made it a good towel made it a terrible ligature to fight against. His fingernails scraped the surface and slid. His fingertips pressed and could not find an edge to hook under. The towel was tight against his throat, pulled by Rizal's hands, and the tightness left no gap, no space for fingers to insert, no purchase for the desperate, scrabbling hands of a man who was being choked by his own most familiar possession.

He kicked. His legs, hanging off the bench, found the floor. His flip-flops -- the Birkenstocks that Priya had mocked -- scraped against the concrete. He tried to stand. Rizal's weight prevented it -- Rizal was behind him, leaning back, using his body weight as leverage, the physics of strangulation requiring not strength but position, the advantage of standing behind a seated man, the advantage of gravity and angle and the simple mechanical fact that a man being choked from behind could not generate the force necessary to dislodge the choker.

Connor's legs kicked. His feet hit the bench. His knees hit the wall. The cell was too small for the struggle -- the walls were there, the benches were there, the space was designed for containment and the containment was now the context of his death, the walls preventing escape, the benches limiting movement, the architecture of the cell collaborating with the man and the towel.

Four seconds had passed since the towel touched his throat.

His vision changed. The fluorescent light, which had been the constant, dominant visual element of the cell -- the flat blue-white that illuminated everything -- the light began to change. Not the light itself but his perception of it. The edges of his visual field darkened. The darkening was not gradual but sudden, the periphery going first, the way a tunnel closed, the world narrowing from a wide field to a circle, the circle shrinking, the light at the centre intensifying as the darkness closed in.

He could hear his own body. The sounds were internal -- the rushing of blood in his ears, the percussion of his heart, the heart beating faster and harder as the body responded to the oxygen deprivation with the only tool it had, which was to pump harder, to push the blood faster through the vessels, to squeeze the remaining oxygen from the haemoglobin and deliver it to the brain, the brain that was the priority, the brain that the body would sacrifice everything to protect, everything except the thing that was killing it, which was the towel around its throat.

His hands were still at his neck. The fingers were still scraping. The fingernails -- bitten, chewed, the nails of a man who had been biting his nails since childhood, the habit that his mother had tried to break with bitter-tasting nail polish and that had persisted through twenty-seven years as the physical manifestation of an anxiety that now, in the final moments, was justified -- the fingernails found no purchase. The towel was smooth. The towel was tight. The towel was the thing that was killing him and the thing he had loved and the thing he had carried through twelve countries and packed in his bag at his mother's kitchen counter and dried himself with on beaches and in hostels and in the shared bathrooms of a life that had been lived on the move, always on the move, never staying, never settling, the towel the constant in a life of variables.

Eight seconds.

His body changed strategy. The hands stopped trying to grip the towel. The hands reached back, behind, toward Rizal. His fingers found Rizal's arms -- the forearms, the muscles tensed, the arms that were pulling the towel's ends in opposite directions, creating the tension that closed the band around his throat. Connor grabbed Rizal's arms. He squeezed. The squeezing had no effect. Rizal's arms were stone. Rizal's arms were the arms of a man who was performing a function, not fighting a fight, and the function required patience not strength, required holding not escalating, required waiting for the body to exhaust itself, which it would, which all bodies did, which was the inevitable conclusion of the physics of strangulation: the body fought, and the fighting required oxygen, and the oxygen was not available, and the fighting therefore consumed the last reserves, and the reserves ran out, and the body stopped.

Twelve seconds.

Connor's thoughts fragmented. The thoughts that had been running in sentences -- the thoughts that had been processing the event, analysing it, narrating it in the third person the way his mind had narrated everything since the first envelope, the constant internal monologue that had been his companion and his curse -- the sentences broke. The words separated. The syntax collapsed.

*Towel.*

*Can't.*

*Mum.*

The fragments were not language. The fragments were the last firings of a neurological system running on fumes, the system producing signal without structure, meaning without grammar, the raw output of a brain that was losing the ability to organise its own activity, the brain shutting down the higher functions first -- language, analysis, self-awareness -- and preserving the lower functions -- heart, lungs, the reflexive struggle of limbs -- the triage of a system in catastrophic failure.

Fifteen seconds.

His legs stopped kicking. The stopping was not a decision. The stopping was the depletion of the resource -- the oxygen that the muscles needed to contract, the oxygen that was not arriving, the oxygen that had been cut off for fifteen seconds which was long enough for the body's reserves to diminish to the level at which voluntary movement became impossible. His legs were still. His arms were still. His hands, which had been reaching for Rizal's forearms, fell to his sides.

His eyes were open. The visual field had narrowed to a small circle at the centre of his vision. The circle contained one thing: the fluorescent light on the ceiling. The tube. The buzzing, humming, never-ending tube that had been the cell's dominant feature since he'd arrived, the light that was the opposite of darkness, the light of places where time stopped, the light that was now the last thing he would see.

The light was beautiful. This was unexpected. The light, which had been ugly and clinical and the aesthetic of institutions that did not care about beauty, the light was now, in the narrowing circle of his dying vision, beautiful. The light was white and clean and the buzzing was not a buzz but a hum and the hum was not mechanical but almost musical, a single sustained note, the note of a fluorescent tube doing the one thing it was designed to do, which was to produce light, which was to illuminate, which was, in the final analysis, a kind of generosity -- the generosity of a thing that gave everything it had to give without reservation or condition, the light falling on everything equally, the bench and the walls and the bars and the towel and the man and the man who was dying.

Twenty seconds.

His last coherent thought was not a thought. His last coherent thought was a voice. The voice was his mother's voice. The voice said the thing his mother said every Sunday on the phone, the thing she said at the end of every call, the thing she said as both farewell and instruction and love:

*Call me when you land.*

He hadn't called. He'd landed in KL forty-seven days ago and he hadn't called. He'd told himself he would and he hadn't. The not-calling was the cruelest thing, the thing he'd done to her without meaning to, the thing that children did to parents -- the slow forgetting, the gradual recession of home from urgent to background, from primary to secondary, the forgetting that was not cruelty but was the natural, inevitable consequence of a life lived far away, the consequence that every mother feared and every child produced.

He hadn't called. He would never call. The phone was in a plastic bag at the processing desk. The phone's last text was from his mother. The phone's last text said: *Are you eating well? Please call soon. Love Mum xxx*

*Mum.*

The word was not spoken. The word was not thought. The word was something deeper than thought, something that existed in the body rather than the mind, something that the body produced in its final moments the way a candle produced light in its final moments, the last output of a system that was shutting down, the last signal from a consciousness that was dissolving, the last word from a person who was ceasing to be a person.

Twenty-five seconds.

The visual field closed. The circle became a point. The point became nothing.

Thirty seconds.

His body went limp. The full, complete limpness of a body that had stopped fighting, stopped trying, stopped generating the electrical signals that powered the muscles and the movements and the struggle. The body was still. The body was weight. The body was the mass of a twenty-seven-year-old man, seventy-eight kilograms, suspended by a towel, held by a man who was patient and professional and waiting for the job to be complete.

Rizal held the towel for three more minutes. The three minutes were necessary -- the insurance, the margin of certainty, the professional's protocol for ensuring that the outcome was the outcome. During the three minutes, there was no movement. No twitch. No reflex. The body was still.

Rizal released the towel.

The body slumped forward. The body was on the bench, the torso draped over the knees, the head hanging, the arms at the sides. Rizal stepped back. He looked at the body. The look was the look of a man confirming a result, the look that a technician gave a completed task, the look that preceded the next step.

The next step was the staging.

Rizal worked quickly. He took the towel -- the blue towel, the Sea to Summit microfiber that had been to twelve countries and was now in a cell at Dang Wangi and was warm from Connor's body and damp from Connor's sweat and smelled of sunscreen and the South China Sea and the accumulated olfactory memory of a life that had ended. He knotted the towel. One end around the horizontal bar at the top of the cell door -- the bar that ran across the top of the barred section, the bar that was at approximately six feet, the height that was necessary for the staging. The other end around Connor's neck. The knot was simple, functional, the knot that a despondent man might tie in a hurry, the knot that was consistent with suicide, the knot that would be photographed and documented and described in a report as *ligature consistent with self-inflicted hanging*.

Rizal positioned the body. The body was lifted -- Rizal was strong, the strength that had held the towel tight for three and a half minutes now deployed in the lifting of seventy-eight kilograms of dead weight, the body positioned so that it hung from the bar, the knees bent because the bar was not high enough for a full suspension, the weight supported by the towel around the neck, the posture of a man who had knotted his towel to a bar and leaned into it and let gravity do the work that despair had ordered.

The staging was complete. The body hung. The towel held.

Rizal returned to his bench. He sat. He adopted the posture of a man who had been sleeping and had been awakened by something -- the posture that he would present to the guard when the guard returned, the posture of a cellmate who had woken to find the other man hanging, the posture that would generate the statements and the reports and the official record of a suicide in custody that was not a suicide, that was a murder, that was the network's protocol for silencing a mule who had talked.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The light fell on the body the way it fell on everything -- equally, without preference, without judgement. The light illuminated the blue towel and the knot and the bar and the face that was Connor's face and was no longer Connor's face because the person who had animated it was gone, the person who had smiled and frowned and laughed and kissed and looked at the Petronas Towers from a rooftop and eaten nasi lemak in a kitchen and held a jade bracelet to a woman's wrist and walked through streets that smelled of incense and diesel and durian -- the person was gone and the face remained and the face was the shell that the person had left behind, the way a building remained after the occupant left, the structure intact, the life absent.

The cell was quiet.

The cell was quiet the way all rooms were quiet after something ended in them -- not the quiet of emptiness but the quiet of aftermath, the particular silence that occupied a space where sound had recently been, where the struggle had produced the sounds of struggle -- the scraping of shoes, the gasping of breath, the contact of hands on fabric, the percussive rhythm of a body fighting for its life -- and where the sounds had now ceased and the silence that replaced them was not peaceful but loaded, the silence of a room that knew what had happened in it.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The body hung. The towel held.

And outside the cell, outside the corridor, outside the building, outside the station, the city continued. Kuala Lumpur at midnight was the Kuala Lumpur it always was -- the lights, the traffic, the hum of eight million lives generating the ambient noise that was the city's heartbeat. The Petronas Towers were lit. The night market on Petaling Street was closing. Mama Siti's kitchen was dark. The ceiling fan in Dorm 3 was turning. The name on the bed frame was waiting.

The city did not pause. The city did not note the passing. The city absorbed the death the way it absorbed everything -- silently, completely, without judgement -- and the city moved on, and the traffic moved, and the lights stayed on, and the morning would come, and the morning would find what the night had left, and the finding would activate the system, and the system would produce the words that systems produced when a prisoner was found dead in his cell, the words that were clinical and bureaucratic and procedurally correct and entirely, devastatingly insufficient:

*Suicide while in custody.*

The fluorescent light buzzed.

The blue towel held.
# Chapter 38: Discovery

Hafiz came back at 11:55 PM.

The return was physically identical to every other return from every other bathroom break he had taken during his eighteen months at Dang Wangi -- the same doors, the same corridors, the same duty desk at the end of the hallway, the same fluorescent light casting the same flat white on the same linoleum floor. But he was carrying RM5,000 in his bank account that had not been there forty minutes ago, and the weight of that money made his footsteps different.

He sat at the duty desk. He placed his phone on the desk. He looked at the corridor. The corridor was empty, lit, quiet. The steel door that separated the desk from the cell block was closed, the way he had left it.

He picked up the paper log -- the handwritten record that existed alongside the digital records, the CCTV footage, the electronic entry logs. The paper log was the document that would be examined, later, by investigators and journalists and lawyers and diplomats. He wrote:

*23:55 -- Returned to duty desk from break. All quiet.*

The word *break* was a lie. The word *break* was not the word for a forty-minute absence purchased for RM5,000 by a text message from an unknown number. But the word *break* was the word that would appear in the log, and the log was the record, and the record was the truth, and the truth was whatever the record said it was.

He sat for three minutes, waiting for his hands to steady. Then he took the torch from its hook -- he didn't need it, the corridor was lit, but the torch was protocol -- and opened the steel door.

He walked the corridor. Twelve metres long, cells on the right side. Eight cells. Three occupied. He walked slowly, the measured pace of a night-shift guard covering ground in a space where nothing was expected to change.

Cell 1. He slid the observation panel open. A Malaysian man, arrested for assault, sleeping on the bench. Heavy, slow breathing. The man was fine. He closed the slot.

Cell 2. Empty. The fluorescent light off in unoccupied cells.

Cell 3. Two men sleeping, one on the bench, one on the floor with a shirt folded into a pillow. Both quiet. He closed the slot.

Cells 4, 5, 6. Empty.

Cell 7.

Hafiz stopped at Cell 7. The stopping was not deliberate -- the body responding to a signal the mind had not yet processed.

He slid the observation panel open.

The first thing he saw was colour. Blue. The blue was wrong. The blue was in the wrong place -- not on the bench, where it had been during the ten o'clock round, not spread across a sleeping man's shoulders, not pooled on the steel surface as a makeshift blanket. The blue was vertical. The blue was at the level of the door's top bar. The blue was a towel, and the towel was knotted to the bar, and below the towel was a body.

The conclusion arrived in approximately 400 milliseconds. The blue towel attached to the top bar. The body suspended below it, knees bent, feet near the floor. Two hours ago, the body had been horizontal on the bench, alive, breathing, wrapped in the same towel. Now the body was no longer alive.

The second conclusion arrived 200 milliseconds later: *This is what the money was for.*

He had known. He had known in the way that humans knew things they didn't explicitly think -- the way a person knew that a gift was not free when the giver was a stranger. He had known that the text message and the RM5,000 and the forty-minute absence were connected to something in the cells, something that required the guard to not be present, something that could not happen while the cells were watched. But knowing in the abstract and seeing in the concrete were different. The text message had been words. Words were manageable, deniable, interpretable. The body was not words. The body was mass and gravity and the colour of skin when the blood stopped flowing, the specific terrible stillness of a human form that had stopped.

His hand was on the observation panel. The hand was trembling.

He looked at the other man in the cell. Rizal. The bar fight man. Rizal was on the bench, sitting upright, his back against the wall. Rizal's expression was -- and this was the detail that Hafiz would remember later, the detail that would surface in the hours of 3 AM wakefulness for months and years afterward -- calm. Not shocked. Not distressed. The expression of a man sitting in a room where nothing unexpected had occurred.

Then the expression changed. Fast, professional, the way a mask was donned. The transformation took less than a second, and it was the performance of a man who had done this before.

"Oh God," Rizal said, his voice loud enough to carry through the observation slot. "Oh God, he -- I woke up and he was -- I tried to stop him but he was already--"

Rizal stood and moved to the body, his hands performing the choreography of attempted rescue -- pulling at the fabric, trying to lift the body.

"I tried," Rizal said, his voice cracking at precisely the right moment. "I tried to get him down but I couldn't -- the knot -- I couldn't--"

Hafiz closed the observation slot -- the hand's automatic response to the need to stop seeing.

He stood in the corridor. The corridor was twelve metres long and lit and empty and the body was on the other side of the steel door and the death was the thing that the RM5,000 had purchased.

The calculation was the calculation that all compromised people perform: he had taken the money, he had left the cells unguarded, the man was dead. The connection between these three facts was causal. If he had not taken the money, if he had not left, the man would be alive. The result: call for backup, follow the protocol, let the system process the event. Let the paperwork absorb the facts. Do not confess. Do not mention the money. Do not mention the text. Do not mention the forty minutes. Let the forty minutes become a break, a bathroom break, a scheduled interval that the log recorded and the protocol permitted.

Hafiz walked to the duty desk. He picked up the phone. He dialled the internal extension for the operations room.

"This is Guard Hafiz, cell block duty. I need backup at the cell block immediately. I have a prisoner -- Cell 7 -- he's... I think he's dead. I think he hanged himself."

The words came out in the voice that people used when reporting emergencies -- too loud, too fast, the shaking quality of a body in shock. The voice was not a performance. Hafiz was genuinely shocked. The gap between accepting RM5,000 and seeing a dead body was a gap that no amount of money could bridge, the gap between *something will happen* and *a man is hanging by a towel from a bar in Cell 7*.

"Guard Hafiz, confirm: prisoner deceased in Cell 7?"

"Yes. I just -- on my round, I looked through the slot and he's -- there's a towel, he's tied it to the bar, he's hanging. I need -- can you send someone?"

"Stay at your position. Backup is on the way."

The phone went down. He sat at the desk. He looked at the log, open to the page where he had written, seven minutes ago, *23:55 -- Returned to duty desk from break. All quiet.*

He picked up the pen and wrote:

*00:02 -- Routine round. Cell 7: discovered prisoner (foreign national, drug case) hanging from cell door bar by towel. Appears deceased. Called operations room for backup.*

The handwriting was unsteady. The letters were too large, the lines not straight, the pen pressing too hard into the paper. The unsteadiness was the physical record of the body's state -- the trembling that the voice had carried and that the hand now carried. The investigators who later examined the log would interpret the unsteadiness as the appropriate response of a guard who had discovered a death. They would not interpret it as the response of a guard who had been paid to enable one. Both interpretations were true. Both truths coexisted in the same trembling hand.

---

Backup arrived in four minutes. Three officers: Corporal Yusof from the operations room, Constable Lee from the front desk, and Sergeant Hamid, the duty officer who had, six hours earlier, received a phone call from a hostel owner named Razak who had warned that the prisoner in Cell 7 was in danger. Sergeant Hamid did not, at this moment, make the connection between the phone call and the body. The connection would be made later, in the morning, when the phone call was retrieved from the duty log and the connection became the kind of connection that produced investigations and the specific, terrible bureaucratic aftermath of a death that might have been prevented. But that was later.

Four men walked the corridor in single file toward Cell 7.

Hafiz opened Cell 7. The key turned, the lock opened, the door swung. The cell was three metres by three. The fluorescent light illuminated the scene with flat, democratic light -- every surface equally lit, every detail equally visible, no shadows to conceal. The light showed everything.

The body hung from the top bar of the cell door's barred section. The blue towel was knotted around the bar and around the neck. The body's knees were bent -- the bar was not high enough for a full suspension, and the body hung in the posture specific to partial-suspension hangings, the weight divided between the ligature and the floor, the knees bent, the feet near the ground, the body in a half-sitting, half-hanging configuration that the officers knew was consistent with suicide by hanging in environments where high anchor points were unavailable.

The body was Connor Briggs. Twenty-seven. Australian. Arrested that day on the North-South Expressway with 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in the lining of a suitcase. Charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. The charge carried a mandatory death penalty.

The face was congested -- the dusky, cyanotic hue that was distinct from the colour of living skin, the blood that entered through the deep arteries continuing to arrive while the compressed veins prevented its return. The tongue was partially protruded. The eyes were open, the conjunctivae showing petechial haemorrhages -- the tiny red dots present in both strangulation and hanging, confirming the mechanism without distinguishing between the two.

Corporal Yusof stepped forward and placed two fingers on the body's wrist. The wrist was cool. Not cold -- the body had not been dead long enough for full cooling, the thermal gradient proceeding at approximately 1 to 1.5 degrees per hour.

"No pulse," Yusof said. The words were for the record.

Sergeant Hamid looked at Rizal. Rizal was standing by his bench, his face carrying the expression of a man who had witnessed something terrible -- the visible, legible signs of emotional impact that the system's reports would describe as *the cellmate appeared visibly distressed*.

"What happened?" Hamid asked.

Rizal's voice was low, shaking, calibrated to the situation. "I was sleeping. On the bench. I don't know what time -- maybe eleven, maybe later. I woke up because I heard something. A sound. Like... a scraping sound. I opened my eyes and I saw him -- standing on the bench, tying the towel to the bar. I said 'Hey, what are you doing?' He didn't answer. I got up. I tried to stop him. I grabbed his legs. But he... he pushed me away. He kicked. And then he... he just leaned into it. He let go. And I couldn't hold him. He was heavy. I tried to pull the towel but the knot was tight. I shouted for the guard. I shouted. Nobody came."

The statement was a piece of craft -- the hesitations placed at the right moments, the repetitions serving the function of a distressed mind circling its own trauma, the details specific enough to be credible but vague enough on timing to preclude contradiction. The work of a man who had given this statement before, in other cells, about other bodies, with other details but the same structure, the same arc, the same conclusion: *I tried to stop him. I couldn't. Nobody came.*

"Nobody came," Hamid repeated.

"I shouted. I banged on the bars. Nobody came."

Hamid looked at Hafiz. The look contained a question without voicing it. Hafiz met the look, his face pale -- shock and guilt producing the same visible symptom.

"I was at the desk," Hafiz said. "I didn't hear anything. The door between the desk and the corridor, it's thick."

The statement did not mention the earbuds, the football highlights, the forty minutes, the text message, the RM5,000, the flat deposit, the girlfriend, the small quiet irreversible decision of a twenty-six-year-old man who had weighed two months' salary against the contents of a text message and had chosen the salary.

Hamid nodded -- the nod that said *noted* without saying *believed* or *doubted*.

"Seal the cell," Hamid said. "Nobody touches the body until the medical examiner arrives. Yusof, call the ME. Lee, start the notification chain. Hafiz, stay at the desk. Write everything in the log. Everything."

The word *everything* was the system's instruction. The word *everything* meant the things the system wanted recorded -- the times, the observations, the actions taken, the statements received. The word *everything* did not mean the RM5,000 or the forty minutes or the text message from the unknown number. The word *everything* meant the everything that fit the conclusion the system had already begun to reach: a man facing the death penalty had chosen to die on his own terms.

The conclusion was wrong. The conclusion had been designed by the people who had paid Rizal to kill and Hafiz to leave and who had left the towel in the cell knowing that protocol required the removal of all ligature-risk items, knowing that the failure to follow this protocol would be attributed to administrative oversight rather than deliberate facilitation, the failure that the report would note as a procedural lapse rather than a conspiracy.

The system did not know this. The system processed the inputs it was given. The inputs were: a body, a towel, a knot, a bar, a charge sheet, a cellmate's statement. The output was: suicide while in custody.

---

The medical examiner arrived at 1:15 AM.

His name was Dr. Rajan Subramaniam. Fifty-three years old. Twenty-one years a forensic pathologist. Over four thousand bodies examined. He had been woken at 12:40 AM and had driven from his house in Bangsar in thirty-five minutes, a drive that took twenty in daylight but longer now because Dr. Rajan drove slowly when called to a death in custody -- the slow driving was the time he used to transition from the domestic world, the wife sleeping, the jasmine in the garden that he could smell as he walked to the car, to the professional world of cells and bodies and the things that happened to human beings when they were held by systems.

The preliminary examination took twenty-two minutes.

He put on gloves. Male body, Caucasian, late twenties, hanging by a blue microfiber towel from the horizontal bar of the cell door. Partial suspension, knees bent, feet ten centimetres from the floor. Overhand knot on the bar, slipknot on the neck. Board shorts, tank top. One flip-flop on the left foot, the other on the floor near the bench.

He examined the ligature mark. The mark was consistent with hanging -- a V-shaped pattern, the point of the V at the back of the neck where the ligature pulled upward toward the anchor point, the arms of the V running along the sides of the neck toward the front where the towel compressed the throat. The mark was wide -- approximately five centimetres, consistent with the width of the folded microfiber towel. The mark was not deep. This was significant. Microfiber did not indent flesh the way a rope did, did not abrade the way a wire did. Microfiber compressed. The skin beneath the towel was reddened but not broken, the surface intact, the damage subcutaneous -- the crushed trachea, the compressed carotid arteries, the damage that killed without marking, the damage that a soft, smooth fabric inflicted differently from a hard, rough one.

He noted: no classic defensive wounds. No scratches on the hands or forearms consistent with fighting an attacker. No bruising on the arms consistent with being restrained. No abrasions on the neck consistent with the victim's own fingers clawing at a ligature. The absence was consistent with suicide -- the self-inflicted death did not produce defensive wounds because the victim was not defending against an external attacker.

The absence was also consistent with a specific type of homicide -- the homicide committed with a ligature that could not be gripped. In such a homicide, the victim's hands went to the throat and found no purchase on the smooth microfiber surface. The scratching of fingernails on microfiber left no mark on the skin because the fabric was between the fingers and the throat -- the barrier that prevented the victim from clawing his own neck in the way that victims of rope or wire strangulation did. The barrier meant that the absence of defensive wounds was not evidence of suicide but evidence of the specific physics of microfiber strangulation. The distinction was the distinction that separated murder from self-inflicted death. The distinction was invisible.

Dr. Rajan did not note this. He noted the absence of defensive wounds and recorded it as *consistent with self-inflicted ligature injury*. The recording was not negligence. The recording was the product of context -- a man found hanging in a cell with a charge sheet that said *mandatory death penalty*, the context in which suicide was not merely plausible but expected, in which the examination was a confirmation rather than an investigation. The system had already reached its conclusion and was now assembling the evidence that supported it -- confirmation bias operating not through malice but through efficiency, the pattern so familiar it had become the template into which evidence was fitted.

He took the body's temperature. Core temperature: 35.8 degrees Celsius. Ambient temperature of the cell: 24 degrees. Using the standard Henssge nomogram for cooling, accounting for the body's mass and clothing: estimated time of death approximately 90 to 120 minutes before the examination, placing the death between 11:15 PM and 11:45 PM. The estimate was consistent with the guard's account -- the last confirmed observation of the prisoner alive at 10:00 PM, the discovery at 12:02 AM. The estimate was also consistent with the forty-minute window that the RM5,000 had purchased, but Dr. Rajan did not know about the window, and the estimate confirmed rather than complicated the timeline.

He photographed the scene. Twenty-three photographs.

He bagged the towel. The towel was untied from the bar and from the neck with care -- the knots documented, the configuration recorded, the towel placed in a large brown paper evidence bag and sealed with red evidence tape and labelled: *Item 1: Blue microfiber towel (Sea to Summit brand), recovered from ligature position, Cell 7, Dang Wangi DPHQ, [date]*. The evidence bag was the towel's final container. The towel had been in a shop in Melbourne, in a suitcase, in a hostel, on beaches, in showers, in twelve countries, around a man's shoulders, around a man's neck, and now in a bag. The bag was the endpoint. The bag was where objects went when they stopped being possessions and became evidence.

On Form Pol. 61, Report of Death, Dr. Rajan wrote:

*Deceased found in partial suspension hanging from horizontal bar of cell door using blue microfiber towel. Ligature mark consistent with hanging. No defensive injuries observed. Rigor mortis: early onset. Lividity: consistent with position. Preliminary cause of death: asphyxia due to ligature compression of neck (hanging). Manner of death: pending investigation, consistent with suicide.*

Dr. Rajan spoke briefly with Sergeant Hamid in the corridor.

"Straightforward," he said. "Hanging. The towel served as the ligature. The full post-mortem will be at HKL tomorrow morning. But the preliminaries are clear."

"Suicide?" Hamid asked. The question was the binary determination that would activate one set of protocols or another -- the fork in the system's decision tree that determined whether Cell 7 was a death scene or a crime scene.

"That's for the coroner. But the scene is consistent. Man facing a capital charge. No signs of foul play. Cellmate's account matches the physical evidence."

"The towel," Hamid said. "Should it have been in the cell?"

Dr. Rajan looked at him. The question was the right question -- the question that, if pursued, would unravel the scene, the question of how a ligature-risk item came to be in a cell with a prisoner facing a capital charge.

"That's an administrative matter," Dr. Rajan said. "Not medical. Note it in your report."

Hamid would note it -- a single line recording the towel's presence in the cell as a procedural oversight, a lapse in the intake process. The note would not identify who had left the towel. The system's investigation would stop at the administrative level, where failures were systemic rather than individual, where blame was distributed across the institution rather than concentrated on a person.

The question of how the towel got into the cell would be asked, noted, and filed. It would not be answered.

---

At 1:45 AM, the notification chain began.

The chain was hierarchical, sequential, each notification triggering the next -- the death radiating outward from Cell 7 through the channels the system had constructed for exactly this purpose.

First notification: Dang Wangi District Commander. Superintendent Razlan bin Idris received the call at his home in Taman Tun Dr Ismail. He asked three questions: Was it suicide? Was there a witness? Was the prisoner foreign? The answers -- appears so, yes, yes (Australian) -- activated the foreign national protocol, the additional layer of notification that applied when the deceased was not Malaysian, the layer that involved embassies and consulates and the international dimension that converted a domestic death into a diplomatic event.

"Full report on my desk by six AM," Superintendent Razlan said. "And call the Australian High Commission."

The Australian High Commission's after-hours emergency line connected to Sarah Chen, Second Secretary (Consular), who had been asleep in her apartment in Mont Kiara and was now awake and writing on a notepad.

"Name: Connor James Briggs. Date of birth: [date]. Passport number: [number]. Arrested today, North-South Expressway. Charged under Section 39B, Dangerous Drugs Act. Found deceased in custody at approximately midnight. Preliminary cause of death: suicide by hanging."

Sarah Chen wrote the details. The writing was the beginning of the consular file -- the translation of the death from one bureaucratic language to another, from the language of the PDRM to the language of DFAT, from Form Pol. 61 to the consular notification form, from Bahasa Melayu to English, from one system to another.

"We'll need access to the body," Sarah said. "And all documentation. Full consular notification to Canberra goes out at oh-six-hundred."

"Understood."

"And the next-of-kin?"

"That's your department, ma'am."

"Yes. It is."

She looked at the name on the notepad. She had made four next-of-kin calls in her two years in KL. This would be her fifth, and the hardest -- the one that combined *your son is dead* with *your son was charged with drug trafficking*. The two facts arrived together, inseparable, the blow that killed the person the parents thought they knew twice -- once with the death, once with the revelation. That call was hours away.

The coroner's office was notified by fax -- a fax, in 2026, the technology that the Malaysian bureaucracy had not fully replaced, the paper record that accompanied the digital record. The fax contained the preliminary report and a cover sheet requesting a coroner's inquest. The fax would be read in the morning by a clerk who would assign a case number and a date, and the inquest would reach the conclusion that the fax's contents already suggested: suicide while in custody.

The prison medical service and SUHAKAM -- the Malaysian Human Rights Commission -- were notified in turn, each adding the death to their systems: a line in a table, a number in a statistic, the death converted from an event into a data point.

Each notification converted the death into a different language. In each language, the event was the same: a man died. In each language, the man was Connor James Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian -- a set of identifiers, a name on a form. The man was no longer a person. The man was an input that the system was processing.

---

At 2:30 AM, Rizal was moved to Cell 2. The move was procedural -- the cellmate removed from the scene, the cell preserved as a death scene. He walked the twelve metres of corridor with the hunched posture of a man in shock, maintaining the performance for the officers watching and the CCTV camera mounted at the corridor's end, its red light blinking every two seconds, recording the objective visual evidence that would show a man in the manner of a man who had been through a traumatic experience.

The door of Cell 2 closed. The lock turned. Alone, Rizal's face changed -- not dramatic, not the dropping of a mask. Subtle: the muscles around the eyes relaxing, the jaw unclenching, the shoulders settling. A body releasing the tension of performance. Rizal's default state was calm. The state of a man who had done a job and was now waiting for the job's consequences to process through the system.

He lay on the bench. The cell was identical to the cell he had left -- same dimensions, same materials, same light, same smell of disinfectant and concrete. The cells were all interchangeable. That was the nature of cells.

He closed his eyes and slept immediately -- the deep sleep of a body that had held a towel tight for three and a half minutes while a man struggled and kicked and then stopped. He slept for an hour.

At 4:15 AM, an officer opened Cell 2. Rizal was told he was being released. The assault charge was being dropped -- insufficient evidence, no complainant, the matter resolved. The paperwork was minimal: a release form signed by Superintendent Razlan, the return of personal effects from the property locker -- a wallet, a phone, keys. The release was not processed at the front desk, not through normal channels. The release was processed in the custody wing office by the night duty officer, who did not ask questions because Inspector Kamal's instructions were the instructions of a man who outranked everyone on the night shift and whose authority made things happen at hours when things did not normally happen.

An officer led him through the rear corridor to the service door, out into the warm, humid pre-dawn air of KL -- the equatorial climate that did not cool, did not offer the relief of temperate cities in their small hours.

Rizal walked across the car park. The car park was lit by sodium lamps, the orange light casting long shadows from the police vehicles parked in rows. He walked through the rear gate -- the gate that was supposed to be locked after midnight, the gate that someone had unlocked for this departure -- and onto Jalan Dang Wangi.

A silver Toyota Vios waited on the opposite kerb. Engine running. Headlights off. Registration plates removed.

Rizal crossed the street. He did not hurry. He opened the rear door, climbed in. The door closed. The Vios pulled away eastbound, past the mamak stalls still lit, the 7-Elevens glowing, the handful of people on the streets at this hour -- shift workers, taxi drivers, the insomniacs and the nocturnal commerce of a metropolis between its darkest hour and dawn.

In the back seat, Rizal pulled a pack of Gudang Garam cigarettes from his returned belongings. He lit one. The smoke filled the car. The driver said nothing. The city passed outside the windows -- Jalan Dang Wangi to Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, past the shuttered fabric shops and gold shops that would not open for hours -- and the man who had been in Cell 7 with him was in a body bag at Dang Wangi and would never ride through a pre-dawn city or smoke a cigarette or watch the sodium lights pass through a windscreen in the way that Rizal was watching them now.

Rizal finished the cigarette. He opened the window. He flicked the butt into the street. The ember bounced once on the asphalt and died.

He disappeared into KL. The Vios disappeared the way vehicles disappeared in a city of eight million -- not with drama or speed but with the ordinary absorption of traffic into traffic, the car becoming one of thousands, the registration-less plates invisible because there was no one looking, and the not-looking was the protection, and the protection was complete.

His name would appear in the cell log of Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters: *Rizal bin Yusof, Cell C-7, admitted [date] 21:45, released [date] 04:30, charge: assault (s. 323 Penal Code), disposition: no further action.* The name would appear nowhere else. No police report would mention him as a person of interest. No investigation would trace his movements after his release. No journalist would interview him. No court would call him. The name was in the log and the log was in the file and the file was in the system and the system was done with him.

The matter was not resolved. The matter was a dead man in Cell 7 and a living man in a silver Vios heading east through pre-dawn KL, and the distance between them growing with every kilometre.

---

By 6:00 AM, the report was on Superintendent Razlan's desk. Twelve pages, typed, single-spaced, on PDRM letterhead: *Report on Death in Custody: Connor James Briggs (Australian National), Dang Wangi DPHQ, [date].*

The report contained: the deceased's arrest and charges, a timeline of processing and detention, the guard's observation log, the cellmate's witness statement, the guard's statement, the medical examiner's preliminary findings, and twenty-three photographs.

The preliminary conclusion read:

*Based on the evidence gathered, the deceased, Connor James Briggs, appears to have committed suicide by hanging using a personal item (microfiber towel) while in custody at Dang Wangi DPHQ. The deceased had been charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which carries a mandatory death penalty. It is assessed that the deceased was despondent over the charges and the likely outcome. The death is consistent with suicide. No evidence of foul play has been identified at this stage. A full coroner's inquest will be convened to determine the official cause and manner of death.*

It was written quickly, efficiently, the way reports were written when the conclusion was predetermined. The phrases were the system's standard vocabulary for this type of death: *appears to have committed suicide*, *consistent with*, *no evidence of foul play*, *despondent over charges*. The phrases had been used before and would be used again. The phrases were not false. The phrases were incomplete.

The report did not mention that the towel should not have been in the cell. The report noted the towel's presence as a fact -- *the deceased was found hanging by a blue microfiber towel (Sea to Summit brand) that was among his personal effects at the time of detention* -- but did not note that protocol for prisoners charged with capital offences required the removal of all items that could be used as ligatures. The omission was the product of a report written by officers documenting the death rather than investigating the detention -- answering the question the system had asked rather than the question it had not.

It did not mention the guard's forty-minute absence. The guard's log showed a break from 23:15 to 23:55 -- the forty minutes recorded as a single word, *break*, the word that covered the forty minutes the way a towel covered a body, completely, neatly, with no edges showing.

Nowhere in its twelve pages did the text message or the RM5,000 appear. Hafiz's personal phone was not examined, was not seized, was not part of the investigation. In the report, Hafiz was a witness -- the guard who had been at his desk when a prisoner decided to die.

Superintendent Razlan read the report in eight minutes. The document was structurally sound. The evidence supported the conclusion. The conclusion was consistent with the circumstances. He signed it. The signature activated the report's distribution: copies to the coroner, to state police headquarters, to SUHAKAM, to the District Commander's file.

The report was now the official truth. The truth was: Connor James Briggs committed suicide while in custody, despondent over drug trafficking charges. The truth was twelve pages, typed, single-spaced, on PDRM letterhead, signed by the District Commander. The truth was in the system.

The other truth -- Rizal and the towel and the forty minutes and the RM5,000 and the text message from the unknown number and the network that had paid for the death and the protocol that silenced mules who talked -- the other truth was not in the system. The other truth was in a guard's phone, and in the memory of a cell that had been cleaned and would be occupied again by midday, and in the space between what happened and what the report said happened.

---

By noon, Cell 7 was clean. Mopped, wiped, scrubbed. The cleaning removed the scuff marks from flip-flops, the smudge of sweat on the bench, the faint smell of sunscreen that had clung to the air since the towel's arrival.

The cleaning did not remove the scratch on the bench's steel surface -- the scratch that said REAPER in letters small enough to miss, letters carved by a hand that was not Connor's and not Rizal's, letters that had been there before and would be there after. The only mark in the cell that outlasted the cleaning. The only mark the system could not scrub.

At 12:15 PM, a new prisoner was admitted to Cell 7. A Malaysian man, twenty-two, arrested for theft from a tourist at KLCC. The man entered the cell. He sat on the bench. He looked at the fluorescent light. He looked at the walls. He looked at the bars. He did not know that a man had died in this cell thirteen hours ago. He did not know that the bench he was sitting on had held a body now at Hospital Kuala Lumpur being prepared for autopsy. He did not know that the bar above the door had held a blue towel and a weight of seventy-eight kilograms and the last moments of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had carried packages for a man named Felix and had told everything to a man named Rizal and had thought about his mother as the light went out.

The new prisoner knew only the cell -- the light, the bench, the walls, the bars, the smell of disinfectant. The cell was clean and lit and ready for the next input.

Somewhere in the system -- in a file, in a form, in a bag, in a photograph -- the record of Connor James Briggs existed, processed, categorised, filed: *suicide while in custody*.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The cell waited.
# Chapter 39: The Morning After

## I. Ahmad

Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail arrived at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters at 7:32 AM on Saturday morning.

He arrived at 7:32 and not 7:30 because a delivery truck had been double-parked outside the 7-Eleven on the corner, and Ahmad had waited with the patience of a man who had learned, over twenty-three years in the Royal Malaysia Police, that two minutes never mattered.

Except today. Today, the difference between 7:30 PM and 7:30 AM -- the twelve-hour difference, the difference between last night and this morning -- that difference would matter. That difference was the weight that would press against his ribs for years, the weight that all police officers carried from the cases that broke wrong, the cases where the timeline was off by hours, by minutes.

But he did not know this yet. He knew only that it was Saturday morning and the weekend shift was quiet and the day would proceed with the measured rhythm of a Narcotics Division Saturday in a city that saved its drug arrests for weeknights.

He parked, entered through the staff entrance, climbed the stairs to the second floor. The Narcotics Division office was empty -- skeleton crew, neither officer arrived yet. His desk was in the corner, by the window that admitted a parallelogram of morning light, the slow clock of sunlight that was the office's only concession to the natural world.

He sat. He logged in. He opened his email. The inbox contained forty-three messages -- administrative, procedural, the digital silt that accumulated in a government inbox overnight.

He almost missed it.

The email was at position fourteen. It had arrived at 2:15 PM the previous day, a Friday afternoon, the hour when Ahmad had been in the field, at the checkpoint on Jalan Sultan Ismail, conducting the routine operation that had kept him away from his desk since noon. The email was from an address he did not recognise: p.sharma.kcl@gmail.com. The subject line read: *URGENT -- Drug trafficking network operating from Lantern Hostel, Petaling Street -- evidence enclosed.*

Ahmad opened the email. He read the first paragraph.

*Dear Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail,*

*My name is Priya Sharma. I am a British citizen, a fourth-year medical student at King's College London, and I have been staying at the Lantern Hostel, 28 Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur, for the past six weeks. I am writing to provide you with evidence of a drug trafficking operation that has been conducted from this hostel by a German national named Felix Decker, which has resulted in the recruitment and exploitation of at least one person I know personally -- an Australian man named Connor Briggs, 27, who has been used as an unwitting drug mule for approximately six weeks and who is, as of this writing, about to transport a suitcase containing methamphetamine to Penang by bus.*

Ahmad stopped reading. He read the name again. Connor Briggs.

The name was not unfamiliar. The query took three seconds. The context arrived.

Connor Briggs. The Australian. Bukit Bintang checkpoint, six weeks ago. A random stop on the pedestrian stretch near Lot 10. Blue eyes, sun-bleached hair, board shorts, flip-flops, the uniform of the backpacker. Clean -- no substances, no paraphernalia, nothing. But the eyes had been wrong. The eyes had contained the particular quality of fear that Ahmad had learned to read over twenty-three years, the fear not of a clean person being inconvenienced by a police check but of a person who had carried something recently or would carry something soon.

Ahmad had given him his card. "Malaysia is not a game, sir," Ahmad had said. The Australian had nodded the nod of a man who was not listening but performing the gesture of listening. The Australian had taken the card. The checkpoint had continued.

And then the calls. Two calls, weeks later, from a burner phone. The first had gone to voicemail -- nineteen seconds of silence, the silence of a person who had made the call and could not complete it. The second had connected for three seconds. Ahmad had said "Hello?" and heard only breathing before the line disconnected.

Ahmad had noted the calls. Ahmad had waited for a third call that had not come.

And now the email. The email that named the Australian, the network, everything -- the complete operational architecture of a trafficking operation that Ahmad's division had been circling for eighteen months, the operation visible at its edges but invisible at its centre: a hostel on Petaling Street, a German man in a private room, a succession of backpackers who carried packages across a city without knowing what the packages contained.

Ahmad read the entire letter. Six minutes. The letter had the thoroughness of a medical student -- Felix Decker's method of recruitment, the escalation from envelopes to suitcases, Connor Briggs's progression from willing participant to trapped mule, the network's contacts, the final job with 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in the lining.

The letter had been sent at 2:15 PM on Friday. Ahmad had been in the field. The letter had sat in his inbox for seventeen hours and seventeen minutes.

Ahmad minimised the email. He opened the case management system. He typed "Connor Briggs" into the search field. The system returned one result.

**Case No: DW/NRK/2026/0847**
**Subject: BRIGGS, Connor James**
**Nationality: Australian**
**DOB: 14/03/1999**
**Arrest Date: [Yesterday's date]**
**Arrest Location: North-South Expressway, KM 247, Perak**
**Charge: Possession and trafficking of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine, 450g) under Section 39B, Dangerous Drugs Act 1952**
**Status: IN CUSTODY -- Dang Wangi DHQ**
**Assigned to: Narcotics Division (pending)**

Ahmad stared at the screen. The case was in his system. The arrest had occurred yesterday afternoon while he was in the field. The case had been logged by the highway patrol unit that made the arrest, assigned to his division automatically by the system's routing algorithm, and was sitting in his queue waiting for his attention on Monday morning when the weekend skeleton crew would hand off the intake cases to the divisional officers for processing.

The case was here. The Australian was here. In this building. In a cell downstairs.

Ahmad stood. He picked up the printed copy of the case file from the in-tray where the overnight officer had placed it. He read the file. The file was thin -- the initial arrest report, the evidence log, the processing record. Standard. Clean. The facts: 450 grams of methamphetamine, concealed in a suitcase lining, detected by canine unit at a highway checkpoint, foreign national arrested and transported to Dang Wangi for holding pending formal charges.

He turned to the second page. The second page was the custody log -- the record of the prisoner's time in the holding cells, the handwritten entries that documented the cell assignment, the observations, the shift changes, the guard checks.

The custody log contained seven entries:

1. **15:08** -- Prisoner BRIGGS, Connor James assigned to Cell C-7. Personal effects surrendered. One item retained: travel towel (blue, microfiber). Authorised by Duty Sgt.
2. **18:00** -- Cell check. Prisoner quiet. No issues.
3. **20:00** -- Cell check. Prisoner quiet. No issues.
4. **21:45** -- Prisoner RIZAL BIN YUSOF (assault charge, remanded) assigned to Cell C-7. Two inmates.
5. **22:00** -- Night shift begins. Cell check by Guard Hafiz. Both inmates quiet. No issues.
6. **23:55** -- Guard Hafiz: bathroom break. Duration: 42 minutes.
7. **00:02** -- Guard Hafiz returns. Cell check. Prisoner BRIGGS found unresponsive, suspended from cell door bars by travel towel (blue, microfiber). Emergency services called. Declared dead at scene, 01:05.

Ahmad read entry number seven. He read it again. He read it a third time. The words did not change. The words were the words of a system recording an event in the language of systems -- clinical, procedural, the language that reduced a human death to a sequence of observations documented in the passive voice. *Found unresponsive. Suspended from cell door bars. Declared dead at scene.*

He turned to the third page. The incident report. The report had been filed by the night duty officer, Inspector Kamal, at 02:30 AM.

**INCIDENT REPORT -- Death in Custody**

**Summary: At approximately 00:40 hours, Guard Hafiz returned from a comfort break to discover the prisoner BRIGGS, Connor James, suspended from the horizontal bar of the Cell C-7 door by means of a blue microfiber travel towel knotted around his neck. The prisoner's cellmate, RIZAL BIN YUSOF, reported that he had been sleeping and had not observed the prisoner's actions. Emergency services were called and the prisoner was declared dead at the scene at 01:05 hours. Preliminary assessment: suicide by hanging (self-inflicted ligature strangulation). The prisoner had been arrested earlier that day for trafficking in dangerous drugs (methamphetamine, 450g), a capital offence under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, and was believed to be despondent over the severity of the charges.**

**Classification: Suicide while in custody.**

Ahmad put the report down. He placed his hands flat on the desk, the pressure of the hands against the surface creating the physical anchor that his mind required.

The towel should not have been in the cell.

This was the first wrong thing. Section 14.3 of the Standard Operating Procedures for Prisoner Custody was explicit: *No personal items that could be used as ligatures, weapons, or instruments of self-harm shall be permitted in holding cells.* The SOP had been revised after the 2019 SUHAKAM inquiry into deaths in custody. The towel should not have been in Cell C-7.

The custody log noted that the towel had been retained by the prisoner, *authorised by Duty Sgt.* Authorised. The word was a shield. The word transferred responsibility from the guard who had tossed the towel into the cell to the unnamed duty sergeant who had apparently approved the deviation from protocol. Ahmad noted the absence of the duty sergeant's name. Ahmad noted that the absence was itself a signature -- the signature of a process that had been designed to have gaps, the documentation that documented everything except the thing that mattered.

The cellmate had been released.

This was the second wrong thing. Ahmad checked the custody log again. Entry 4: Rizal bin Yusof, assault charge, remanded, placed in Cell C-7 at 21:45. Ahmad opened the case management system and searched for Rizal bin Yusof. The system returned one result.

**Case No: DW/GEN/2026/3312**
**Subject: RIZAL BIN YUSOF**
**Charge: Assault (Section 323, Penal Code)**
**Status: RELEASED -- 03:15, [today's date]. Released on personal bond, RM500. No charges filed.**

Released at 3:15 AM. Two hours after a man had died in his cell. Released on personal bond for an assault charge that had not been filed. Released in the middle of the night, when releases did not happen, when the processing desk was closed, because releases at three AM required an urgency that assault charges did not possess.

Ahmad sat with this. He sat with the towel and the cellmate and the release and the forty-two-minute bathroom break and the email from Priya Sharma that had arrived at 2:15 PM and sat in his inbox while the hours passed and the night came and the things that happened at night happened.

He knew.

He did not say it. He did not speak it aloud into the quiet of the empty office at 7:48 AM on a Saturday morning. The word that connected the data points was not *suicide*. The protocol violation and the planted cellmate and the paid guard and the middle-of-the-night release pointed to the other word with the convergent precision of lines drawn to a vanishing point.

The knowing was not a revelation but a confirmation -- the final piece of a pattern he had been observing for eighteen months. Mules caught, mules dead in custody, reports that said *suicide*, the system producing silence with the mechanical regularity of a factory.

He checked his phone. Four missed calls from RAZAK -- LANTERN HOSTEL. Timestamped between 3:30 PM and 6:45 PM yesterday -- all during the hours when Ahmad had been in the field with his phone on silent.

He called Razak back. Three rings. The voice that came through was the voice of a man who had not slept.

"Ahmad."

"Encik Razak. You called yesterday. Four times. I was in the field."

"The boy is dead, Ahmad."

"I know," Ahmad said. "I have the report."

"The report says suicide."

"I know what the report says."

A pause. The pause was not empty. The pause was the space between two men who were not saying the thing they both knew, the space that existed in police work between the evidence and the accusation, between the knowing and the proving, between the truth that was obvious and the truth that was admissible.

"I called Hamid yesterday," Razak said. "At three thirty. I told him the boy was in danger. I told him the network had contacts in the station. I told him to protect the prisoner. He said the prisoner was safe. He said you would call me in the morning."

"I am calling you in the morning."

"The morning is too late."

Ahmad did not disagree. He held the phone and looked at the report on his desk and the case management system's entry for Rizal bin Yusof, released at 03:15, no charges filed, and understood that the morning was too late. The events that the morning was supposed to prevent had occurred in the gap between evening and dawn, when the skeleton crew staffed the building and the reduced capacity was not a bug but a feature.

"I have the letter," Ahmad said. "From the British woman. Priya Sharma."

"She sent it before she flew."

"It arrived at two fifteen yesterday. I was not at my desk."

Another pause -- the sound of a man processing the information that the letter had arrived seventeen hours before the death, that the processing speed of a police inbox on a Friday afternoon had been slower than the processing speed of a network that killed people in cells.

"What will you do?" Razak said.

Ahmad looked at the report. The report said *suicide while in custody*. The report was signed by Inspector Kamal. The report was in the system. The report was the official record. The report was the truth that the institution would present to the embassy, to the family, to the media, to anyone who asked what had happened to Connor James Briggs in Cell C-7 at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters.

"I will do my job," Ahmad said.

He ended the call. He opened a new document on his computer.

The typing was slow -- the typing of a man who understood that these words were the beginning of a process that would take months and might result in nothing or might result in everything.

He typed the heading: **INTERNAL MEMORANDUM -- Request for Investigation into Death in Custody, Case No. DW/NRK/2026/0847.**

The cursor blinked. The morning light moved across the desk.

Ahmad began to write.

---

## II. The Hostel

Uncle Razak put the phone down.

He was standing in the kitchen of the Lantern Hostel, in the narrow galley that Mama Siti had claimed as her domain. The kitchen smelled of coconut milk and sambal and the rendered fat of dried anchovies crisping in a pan -- the morning smells, the building's olfactory pulse.

Mama Siti was at the stove, her back to Razak, stirring rice with the wooden paddle, the hands performing their function with the automatic precision of a woman who had made nasi lemak so many times that the recipe existed in her muscles rather than her memory.

"Siti."

She did not turn. She did not stop.

"The boy," Razak said.

Mama Siti's hands stopped. The stopping was brief -- a pause of perhaps two seconds, the paddle stationary in the rice, the steam rising around her hands. Then the hands resumed. The stirring continued. The rice was stirred.

"I know," she said.

The two words were spoken in the tone of a woman who had known -- not through information but through the older channel that connected her to the building and the building to the people inside it. She had set the plate this morning, the plate that was her system for tracking the living, the simple analogue monitoring of a woman who trusted food over computers, trusted the fundamental transaction between a cook and an eater.

The plate was on the counter. Nasi lemak -- rice, sambal, anchovies, peanuts, egg, cucumber. Set for Connor.

No one came.

The sambal darkened slightly at its edges, the vibrant red deepening to brown-red. The egg cooled. The cucumber wilted. Mama Siti looked at the plate the way she looked at all uncollected plates -- not with surprise but with the expression of a woman who understood that the uncollected plate was testimony, the proof that someone was supposed to be here and was not.

She turned back to the stove. There were other guests. There were always other guests.

Razak left the kitchen. He found Mei Ling at reception.

Mei Ling was already there -- always already there, the desk and the woman existing in a symbiotic arrangement that showed no signs of dissolving. Polo shirt, ponytail, composed.

"Ahmad called me back," Razak said.

"And?"

"The report says suicide."

Mei Ling's expression did not change. The not-changing was itself a response -- the controlled non-reaction of a woman who had expected this and whose preparation consisted of suppressing the reaction the information warranted.

"The bed," she said.

"Yes."

She turned to the reception computer. She navigated to the room allocation matrix. Dorm 3, Bed 7:

**BED 7 -- BRIGGS, Connor J. -- Check-in: [47 days ago] -- Check-out: OPEN -- Status: OCCUPIED**

She changed the status.

**BED 7 -- VACANT**

A single keystroke. The system knew only two states -- occupied and vacant -- and the transition between them was a binary, a switch, the clean digital boundary between someone being here and someone not being here.

She took fresh sheets from the supply cupboard and carried them upstairs, up the narrow 1928 staircase with its walls covered in stickers -- the accumulated decorative sediment of a thousand travellers, names and logos and country flags layered like geological strata.

She reached Dorm 3. The door was open. The dorm was dim, lit only by the red lantern that hung in the centre, the amber semi-darkness that distinguished the Lantern Hostel from the fluorescent dormitories of the budget chains. Eight bunks. Sixteen beds. Twelve occupied, three empty, one about to be emptied.

Bed 7 was a lower bunk, third from the door, against the wall that faced the air well. The bed was made -- Connor's version of made, which was the sheet pulled approximately upward and the pillow placed approximately at the head and the result being approximately the shape of a made bed without the precision of an actually made bed. His things were gone. His daypack, his clothes, his charger, the detritus of a life lived out of a bag -- all of it was in an evidence room at Dang Wangi, catalogued and bagged and tagged with the case number that Ahmad had read on his screen.

Mei Ling stripped the bed. The sheet came away with the soft, tearing sound of fabric detaching from a surface it had been pressed against for weeks. She folded it -- thirds lengthwise, then thirds crosswise -- and placed it in the laundry bag. The pillowcase followed.

The mattress bore the impression of a body -- the subtle depression that forty-seven nights of the same sleeping posture had pressed into the foam. Connor had slept on his side, right side down, knees slightly bent. The mattress remembered this. The foam held the shape even when the pressure was removed, the ghost of a body preserved in the material that had supported it. The impression would fade. The next guest's weight would overwrite it.

Mei Ling placed the fresh sheet on the mattress. She tucked the corners. She smoothed the surface. She stepped back.

The bed was made. The bed was vacant.

On the inner surface of the wooden rail, facing the mattress, a name was carved: **LENA**. Small, shallow letters scratched with a fingernail or a key. The only evidence that another mule had slept in this bed, been recruited by the same German man, carried packages across the same city, been arrested and sent to Kajang Prison.

Connor had not carved his name. He had slept here forty-seven nights and never read the name that was there, never known the bed's history. The only mark he had left was the depression in the mattress, already being erased by the fresh sheet, by the smoothing of Mei Ling's hands -- the hospitality industry's version of forgetting.

Mei Ling picked up the laundry bag. She left the dorm. She closed the door behind her.

---

## III. Felix

On the third floor of the Lantern Hostel, Private Room 1 was empty.

The room had been occupied until 4:00 AM. Mei Ling's paper ledger showed:

**DECKER, Felix -- Private Room 1 -- Check-out: 04:00 -- Forwarding address: NONE -- Balance: PAID IN FULL -- Notes: --**

The last official record of Felix Decker at the Lantern Hostel. Four AM -- an hour when the hostel was dark and the reception desk was unmanned and the only way out was the guest code, the four digits that opened the door onto Petaling Street at an hour when the street belonged to cats and rats and the men who slept in doorways.

The room, when he left it, contained no evidence of his eighteen-month tenancy. Felix had wiped every surface with alcohol-based cleaning wipes -- desk, nightstand, handles, switches, sink, toilet. He had checked under the mattress, behind the headboard, the bathroom drain, the floor for hairs. The room was clean with the particular cleanliness of a professional departure, the deliberate removal of every physical trace.

Over eighteen months, Felix had paid the Lantern Hostel approximately RM65,000 in cash. Uncle Razak had not calculated this number until now, and the calculating produced the particular nausea of a man who understood that the money was clean only in the sense that it had been laundered -- that the hostel had been, for eighteen months, a subsidiary of the network's operational budget.

Felix Decker was gone. The linen shirts were gone. The leather gloves -- the driving gloves that he wore not for driving but for the handling of things that should not carry his fingerprints -- were gone. The professional camera that he had used as a prop, the camera that supported his cover story as a travel photographer, the camera that contained no photographs of travel and many photographs of routes and drop-off locations and the faces of mules and the faces of contacts -- the camera was gone.

Felix was a professional. The pattern was the pattern -- eighteen months at a location, recruit mules from the transient population, operate the supply chain, and when the operation was concluded by a mule's arrest, depart. Sanitise. Relocate. Begin again.

He was, at this moment, in a Grab heading south on the KLIA Expressway. An 8:45 AM AirAsia flight to Jakarta, then Phnom Penh, then wherever the network sent him next. He sat with his single carry-on -- a black Samsonite, immaculate -- and a leather passport holder containing a German passport that was real and a Dutch passport that was not. He did not think about Connor Briggs. Connor Briggs was a resolved variable, an entry in a ledger that Felix did not keep because ledgers were evidence.

There were always more Connors. The backpacker trail produced them with industrial regularity -- the gap-year kids, the digital nomads, the perpetual travellers running from adulthood toward the fiction of freedom. They arrived at hostels with open faces and empty wallets and the belief that the rules were suggestions. Felix found them. Felix befriended them. Felix used them.

The city fell behind. The airport approached. The room that had been his for eighteen months was now a room that was no one's, and Mei Ling would clean it this afternoon, and the cleaning would find nothing, and the nothing was the most damning evidence of all.

---

## IV. Priya

In London, it was 12:47 AM.

Not the 12:47 AM of clubs and night buses. This was the 12:47 AM of exhaustion -- a woman who had flown eleven hours from KL to Heathrow and re-entered a flat that no longer fit, the life she had left as one person and was re-entering as another.

She had showered. She had eaten toast and Marmite, the taste of before. She was in after. The gap was unbridgeable.

She had tried to sleep. Forty minutes. The bed too soft, the room too quiet, the English February air too cold -- everything wrong in the way that home was wrong when the thing you feared was happening twelve thousand kilometres away.

She gave up on sleep. She made tea -- PG Tips, in the mug with the King's College crest, comforting in the diminished, apologetic way that English tea was comforting.

She sat at the small table in the kitchen. She opened her laptop. The inbox contained a response from Tomoko -- brief, precise, confirming receipt and forwarding to The Star. Nothing from Ahmad. Nothing from the Australian High Commission. Nothing from Connor.

She checked WhatsApp. The last message in their conversation:

**Connor:** I will. Love you.

*I will.* The permanent tense of Connor's life -- the future that never became present, the promise always about to be fulfilled and never fulfilled.

She put the phone face-down on the table, then picked it up again. Refreshed her inbox. Nothing. Refreshed again. The compulsive query of a person whose only available action was checking, the only thing she could do from a kitchen in Bermondsey while the man she loved was in a cell twelve thousand kilometres away.

She did not know that Connor was dead. The not-knowing was the mercy that time zones provided -- the eight-hour gap that preserved, for a few more hours, the possibility that the letter had been read, that Ahmad had acted, that the system had worked.

The not-knowing would end at 6:23 AM London time. She would wake and find an email from the Australian High Commission requesting her to call a specific number regarding a matter of consular significance relating to Mr. Connor James Briggs. She would call. A consular officer would ask if she was seated. The voice would say: "I'm calling to inform you that Mr. Connor Briggs was found deceased in police custody at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters in Kuala Lumpur at approximately 12:40 AM local time on Saturday. The initial report indicates suicide."

The phone would fall from her hand. The voice would continue speaking -- resources, counselling, consular assistance -- and Priya would not hear it because she would be standing at the kitchen counter with her head bowed making a sound that was not crying and not screaming but something between the two.

But that was 6:23 AM. This was 12:47 AM. And the not-knowing was the last kindness and the kindness would not last.

---

## V. Tomoko

At 8:15 AM, Kuala Lumpur time, Tomoko Sato sent a second email to The Star.

She was in the common room of the Lantern Hostel -- the Saturday-morning quiet, the ceiling fan turning, CNN muted on the wall, the news cycle not yet including the death of an Australian backpacker in a Malaysian police cell.

Tomoko had not slept. She had learned of the death from Mei Ling, who had learned it from Razak, who had learned it from Ahmad -- the chain of voices passing the fact with the controlled delivery of people who had expected the worst and found that expectation had not lessened the impact.

Tomoko opened her email. She composed the message. The composing was fast -- Tomoko wrote the way she photographed, in sharp, focused bursts, the prose as precise as her framing, each sentence a deliberate capture.

*To: newsdesk@thestar.com.my*
*From: t.sato.photo@gmail.com*
*Subject: UPDATE -- URGENT -- Death in custody, Dang Wangi, foreign national -- evidence of murder*

*To the news editor,*

*This is a follow-up to my email of yesterday (sent 2:16 PM, Friday). The circumstances have changed.*

*Connor Briggs, the Australian national I identified as a drug trafficking victim in my previous correspondence, is dead. He died overnight in a holding cell at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters. The official report classifies the death as suicide.*

*He was murdered.*

*The evidence: (1) A personal item that should have been confiscated under standard custody protocol was left in his cell. (2) A cellmate was placed in his cell hours after his arrest and released hours after his death, at 3:15 AM, with no charges filed. (3) The duty guard took an unscheduled 42-minute break during the period in which the death occurred. (4) The drug trafficking network that I documented in my previous email -- the network operated by Felix Decker from the Lantern Hostel, Petaling Street -- has a documented pattern of silencing mules who are arrested. A previous mule died in custody under identical circumstances six months ago (see attached clipping from your own newspaper, page 7, August edition).*

*The prisoner is dead. The report says suicide. He was murdered. The evidence I provided yesterday could have prevented this death if it had been acted upon in time. It was not. The question is why.*

*I have attached an additional sixteen photographs taken this morning, documenting Felix Decker's room (now empty -- he checked out at 4:00 AM), the hostel's records, and the timeline of events as reconstructed from multiple witnesses. The full archive of fifty-nine photographs with metadata remains available at the secure link provided in my previous email.*

*I am available for interview at any time. I will remain in Kuala Lumpur until this matter is resolved.*

*Tomoko Sato*
*Freelance photojournalist*
*Published: Asahi Shimbun, The Guardian, Reuters*

She pressed send. The email joined the queue at The Star's news desk, where the junior editor who had flagged yesterday's email for review and been told to hold it would now find the follow-up and feel the particular chill of a story that had escalated from *a prisoner is in danger* to *the prisoner is dead*.

Tomoko closed the laptop. She sat back on the battered vinyl sofa and looked at the ceiling fan, its dusty blades turning through air that smelled of Tiger Balm, cooking oil, damp wood, and the sweet rot of an old building in the tropics.

Seven years as a journalist had taught her that the story was never the event. The story was the system. The story of Connor Briggs was not a man strangled in a cell -- it was the system that placed a naive backpacker in the path of a trafficking network, the network in the shelter of a hostel, the hostel in the jurisdiction of a police force within the network's reach. The story was the nine hours between a letter arriving at 2:15 PM and a death at 11:15 PM. The story was the inbox that was not checked.

She would write the longer story -- not for The Star, which would publish its own restrained version, but for The Guardian. The story that traced the network from the hostel to the highway to the cell, that named Felix Decker and connected this death to the previous death and the pattern to the system. She would pitch it with the fifty-nine photographs stored on a server in Tokyo, encrypted, backed up, beyond the reach of anyone who might prefer the evidence not to exist.

She thought about Connor Briggs. She had not liked him -- a fact she held without guilt. He had been irritating, reckless, wilfully ignorant. He had dismissed her warnings, called her uptight, reported her photographs to Felix.

And he had been twenty-seven years old. And he had been strangled with his own towel. And the system that should have protected him had failed, and the failure was not an accident but a product.

Tomoko did not cry for stories. She documented. Documentation was her response to grief, the way cooking was Mama Siti's response and filing reports was Ahmad's and cleaning beds was Mei Ling's. Each person processed the death through the function they performed, the work absorbing the feeling the way the building absorbed the death.

She opened her laptop again. She began to write.

---

## VI. The Bed

In Dorm 3, the ceiling fan turned. The air moved over Bed 7 -- freshly made, white sheet pulled tight, pillow centred. No blue towel. The towel was in an evidence bag at Dang Wangi, catalogued as Item 7 on the property list of a deceased prisoner, no longer a towel but evidence, no longer a possession but the instrument of a death.

The wood held LENA's name and no other. Connor had not carved his mark. The bed would receive the next body and the next, the mattress compressing and decompressing, the sheets changed and changed again, the bed performing its function with the indifference of an object that did not distinguish between its users, did not rank them, did not mourn them.

And downstairs, in the kitchen, the plate of nasi lemak sat on the counter. The rice had cooled. The sambal had darkened. At ten AM, Mama Siti would pick up the plate. She would scrape the food into the bin. She would wash it and stack it with the other plates, and the plate would be used again tomorrow for another guest, the objects of the hostel performing their roles without regard for the people who used them, the objects outlasting the people, the objects remaining when the people were gone.

The hostel absorbed the death the way it absorbed everything. The building had been absorbing things for ninety-eight years -- the textile trade, the occupation, the gambling, the sex trade, the backpackers, the deaths. To every guest who checked in, it was a charming pre-war shophouse with a 7.8 rating on Hostelworld and amazing nasi lemak and lukewarm showers and a rooftop with a view of the Petronas Towers.

The building absorbed Connor Briggs's death and the absorption was complete and the completeness was the horror.

The fan turned. The bed waited.

Bed 7. Dorm 3. The Lantern Hostel. Vacant.
# Chapter 40: 3 AM

The phone rang in Hawthorn at 3 AM on a Tuesday morning.

The phone was the landline -- the one in the hallway, the one that David and Karen Briggs kept because David believed that landlines were reliable and mobile networks were not, the belief of a generation that had grown up with phones attached to walls and retained a loyalty to the technology that had not been updated since 1987. The phone was beige. The phone had a coiled cord. The phone sat on a small table beside a bowl of keys and a photograph of Connor and Megan at the beach, Connor eleven, Megan nine, both squinting against the sun, both gap-toothed, both alive.

The phone rang and the sound of it -- the old-fashioned trill, the mechanical bell rather than the digital chime -- entered the house at 3 AM and travelled through the hallway and up the staircase and into the bedroom where David and Karen slept and the sound woke David first because David had always been a light sleeper and Karen had always slept deeply and the difference in their sleep was one of the many small asymmetries of a marriage that had lasted thirty-one years.

David got up. He went to the hallway. He picked up the phone. The receiver was cold from the night air that leaked through the front door's gaps.

"Hello?"

"Mr. Briggs? Mr. David Briggs?"

"Yes."

"My name is Sarah Chen. I'm calling from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I'm the duty consular officer. I'm calling about your son, Connor."

David's body knew. The body knew before the mind because the body was faster than the mind and the body understood the semiotics of 3 AM phone calls -- the specific, unmistakable frequency of a phone ringing at an hour when phones did not ring unless the reason for ringing was the reason that no parent wanted to hear. The body understood and the body responded: the hand tightened on the receiver, the legs weakened, the chest constricted, the breathing changed.

"What happened?"

"Mr. Briggs, I need to inform you that your son Connor was taken into police custody on Friday, the forty-seventh day of his stay in Malaysia. He was arrested at a police checkpoint in Perak state for possession of a controlled substance."

"A controlled substance." David repeated the words. The words were the words of officialdom, the sanitised vocabulary of a system that converted human catastrophes into administrative language. Controlled substance. The phrase meant drugs. The phrase meant that his son, his twenty-seven-year-old son who he'd driven to soccer practice and helped with homework and sent $2,000 a month to support his gap year -- his son had been arrested with drugs in Malaysia.

"What kind of substance?"

"Methamphetamine. Four hundred and fifty grams. Mr. Briggs, under Malaysian law, this amount triggers the presumption of trafficking under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act."

"Trafficking." The word arrived in David's mind and the mind rejected it the way a body rejected a foreign organ, the incompatibility absolute, the word and the son it described failing to occupy the same conceptual space. Trafficking was a word from newspapers. Trafficking was a word from documentaries that played on SBS late at night. Trafficking was not a word that belonged to Connor Briggs, Hawthorn, Victoria, the boy who wanted to see the world.

"Mr. Briggs, there is more. And I need you to sit down."

David did not sit down. David stood in the hallway of his house at 3 AM in his pyjamas and his bare feet on the carpet and held the beige phone with the coiled cord and waited.

"Connor was found dead in his cell at Dang Wangi district police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. He was found in the early hours of Saturday morning. The official report states that he died by suicide while in custody."

The silence that followed was not the silence of processing. The silence was the silence of cessation -- the cessation of the mechanism by which David Briggs interpreted the world, the mechanism that took input and produced understanding, the mechanism that had been operating continuously for fifty-nine years and had just received an input that exceeded its capacity. The mechanism stopped. The silence was the sound of the mechanism stopped.

Karen appeared at the top of the staircase. She was in her nightgown, her hair disordered from sleep, her face carrying the particular confusion of a person awakened at 3 AM by a sound that should not exist at 3 AM. She saw David. She saw David's face. She saw David's hand on the phone. She saw everything she needed to see in the posture of a man who had received news that had changed the shape of the world, and the change was not an improvement.

"David?"

David looked at her. His mouth opened. No words came. The words that should have come -- *Connor is dead, Karen, our son is dead in Malaysia, they say it was suicide, they say he had drugs, they say he's gone* -- the words were formed but they would not travel from his mind to his mouth because the travel required a bridge and the bridge had collapsed, the bridge between knowing and saying, between the private fact and the shared fact, the bridge that separated a man who knew his son was dead from a couple who knew their son was dead.

Karen descended the staircase. Her hand was on the banister. Her feet were bare. The carpet was the same carpet that Connor had crawled on as a baby, walked on as a toddler, run on as a child, tracked mud on as a teenager. The carpet held the history of the family in its fibres, the accumulated evidence of thirty years of feet.

She reached David. She put her hand on his arm. The hand was warm from the bed. The hand was the hand that had held Connor when he was born, held him when he was sick, held his face when he was twelve and his first girlfriend had broken up with him and he'd come home and sat in the kitchen and cried, and she'd held his face in her hands and said *it'll be okay, darling, it'll be okay*.

"Who is it?" Karen said.

David gave her the phone. He gave it to her because he could not say the words and the phone contained the words and the phone could say them so he didn't have to. He gave her the phone and stepped back and leaned against the hallway wall and felt the wall hold his weight, the wall that he had painted himself, the wall that was the colour Karen had chosen -- "Dulux Antique White, half strength" -- the wall that was part of the house that was part of the life that had just been altered permanently, irreversibly, by a phone call from a woman named Sarah Chen in a city twelve thousand kilometres away.

Karen put the phone to her ear. Sarah Chen repeated the information. The information entered Karen's body through her ear and travelled through the neural pathways and reached the part of her brain that processed language and the language was processed and the processing produced a sound.

The sound was not a word. The sound was not a scream. The sound was something that existed between words and screams, in the territory that language had not mapped because the territory was visited so rarely and by so few. The sound was the sound of a mother learning that her child was dead, and the sound had no name because naming it would have required the kind of clinical distance that the sound made impossible, the sound too large and too raw and too fundamental to be reduced to syllables.

The sound filled the hallway. The sound reached the kitchen, where the Vegemite jar sat on the counter. The sound reached the living room, where the cricket would play again on the weekend. The sound reached the garden, where a man with a phone had stood four days ago and photographed Karen through the window. The sound reached the bedroom, where two pillows held the impressions of two heads that would not sleep again tonight or for many nights after.

David held Karen. Karen held the phone. The phone held the line to Kuala Lumpur. The consular officer held the silence that followed the sound, the silence that consular officers were trained to hold, the silence that was not awkward but necessary, the silence that a person needed to occupy after receiving the information that their child was dead and the death was violent and the death was in a foreign country and the death was described by a word -- *suicide* -- that they did not believe and would never believe because the word did not describe their son, their Connor, the boy who was confident and careless and alive, the boy who was always alive, the boy for whom death was the thing that happened to other people's children, not to theirs, never to theirs.

"We want to bring him home," Karen said.

Her voice was steady. The steadiness was not strength. The steadiness was the body's emergency response -- the system that took over when the regular systems failed, the system that allowed a person to function, to speak, to form sentences, while the deeper systems were in catastrophic failure. The steadiness was the human equivalent of a building's emergency generator -- temporary, limited, insufficient for anything except the basic operations.

"Of course, Mrs. Briggs. The High Commission will assist with the repatriation process. We'll need--"

"We want him home."

The repetition was not for Sarah Chen's benefit. The repetition was for Karen's benefit -- the words spoken aloud as a directive, as an instruction to the universe, as the assertion of a mother's authority over her child's body even when the child was no longer in the body and the body was in a morgue in a city she had never visited and might never visit and the distance between the body and the home was twelve thousand kilometres of ocean and land and air and the bureaucratic infrastructure of two countries that had to cooperate to move the remains of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian from a police morgue in Kuala Lumpur to a funeral home in Hawthorn.

"We'll bring him home," Karen said. "David and I will fly to Malaysia. Today. We'll bring him home ourselves."

"Mrs. Briggs, the process typically takes--"

"Today."

The word was the last word that Karen Briggs would speak with the steadiness of the emergency generator. After the word, the generator would fail, and the deeper failure would surface, and the sound would return -- the sound that had no name, the sound that filled the hallway and the house and the street and the suburb and the city and the night.

David held her. The hallway held them. The house held the hallway. The night held the house. And in the night, in the hallway, in the house in Hawthorn where Connor Briggs had grown up and left and never returned, two people stood together and the standing was the beginning of a grief that would not end, that would persist through the flight to KL and the morgue and the identification and the repatriation and the funeral and the years that followed, the grief that would live in the house the way ghosts lived in buildings, permanent, invisible, altering the atmosphere without being seen.

The phone call ended. The landline was placed back on the table, beside the bowl of keys, beside the photograph of Connor and Megan at the beach.

The photograph was still there. The photograph had not changed. In the photograph, Connor was eleven and gap-toothed and squinting and alive. In the photograph, the sun was shining and the beach was golden and the water was blue and the world was the world of a family on a Saturday at the beach, the world where the worst thing that could happen was sunburn or a lost sandal or the car running low on petrol on the way home.

The photograph would remain on the table. The photograph would be there when Megan arrived, called from her flat in Fitzroy, arriving at 4:30 AM in her pyjamas and a coat, her face carrying the same expression that David's face had carried an hour ago -- the expression of a person whose mechanism had stopped. The photograph would be there when the neighbours came, and the golf club called, and the local paper asked for a comment, and the world that David and Karen had built in Hawthorn was invaded by the world that existed beyond Hawthorn, the world where sons died in foreign police stations and the word *mule* appeared in newspapers and the word was followed by the word *death* and both words were attached to the name Connor Briggs and the attachment was permanent.

At 4:17 PM Malaysian time on Saturday -- sixteen hours after the body was found, thirty-three hours after Connor Briggs walked out of the Lantern Hostel with a black suitcase -- an Instagram account with no profile picture posted a photograph.

The account was @HostelReaper. The account had three posts. The first was a photograph of graffiti on a wall in Chinatown -- the "@HostelReaper" tag with the reaper icon that Connor had photographed on Day 2 and posted to his own Instagram, thinking it was street art. The second was a photograph of a backpack on a bus seat with the caption *Another one packed for the journey. #NoReturn*. The third was a photograph of an empty bunk bed in a hostel dorm -- Bed 7, Dorm 3, The Lantern Hostel -- with a blue towel draped across the pillow and the caption *Bed 7. Dorm 3. The Lantern Hostel, KL. Still warm. #LocalLaw #101Ways #CheckoutIsMandatory*.

The fourth post was new.

The photograph showed a cell. A holding cell. Grey concrete walls, a steel bench bolted to the floor, bars painted institutional green. The cell was empty. The fluorescent light was on. The bench was bare. On the wall above the bench, scratched into the paint, barely visible unless you were looking for it, four letters:

REAPER.

The caption read: *Connor Briggs. 27. Australia. Day 47. Checked out. #LocalLaw #101Ways #MandatoryDeath #TheRulesApply*

The post had no likes. The post had no comments. The post existed in the algorithmic wilderness of Instagram, an account with no followers posting to no audience, the digital equivalent of graffiti on a wall -- a mark made not to be seen but to be left, the compulsion to record, to document, to note the passing of a person through a system that did not note passings.

The post would be found later. Weeks later. By a journalist at The Star who was following the story, who was tracing the @HostelReaper account across the internet, who would discover that the account had posted about twelve deaths in eleven countries over three years, always in hostels, always before the death was publicly reported, always with the hashtag #101Ways and always with the specific, detailed, impossible knowledge of someone who knew the victim's name and bed number and date of death before anyone else did.

The journalist would not identify @HostelReaper. No one would. The account would continue posting. The account would post about the next death, and the next, and the next. The account was the series' thread, the connective tissue between the books, the observer that existed outside the stories and inside them simultaneously, the entity -- person, algorithm, ghost, system -- that watched hostels the way Razak watched his map, that tracked deaths the way deaths tracked victims, that existed in the space between the stories and the silences.

But that investigation was later. That was weeks and months of reporting and dead ends and unanswered questions. That was Part 5. That was aftermath.

This was still Part 4. This was still the day of the death. And on the day of the death, the post existed unnoticed, a digital mark on a digital wall, four lines of text and a photograph and the hashtags that were the account's signature, the account's voice, the account's way of saying: *I saw. I know. I recorded. The checkout is mandatory.*

At Dang Wangi, Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail sat at his desk and read Priya's letter for the third time.

The letter was on his screen. The letter had arrived at 2:15 PM the previous day. The letter had sat in his inbox for seventeen hours while he was in the field, while the night shift ran, while a guard named Hafiz took a forty-minute bathroom break, while a man named Rizal performed the function he had been placed in the cell to perform.

Seventeen hours. The letter had been seventeen hours too late.

Ahmad read the letter and the letter confirmed everything he had suspected for six months. Felix Decker. The Lantern Hostel. Wei's phone repair shop. The supply chain. The contacts. The routes. The schedule. The recruitment of foreign backpackers. The pattern that Ahmad had been tracking through informants and surveillance and the slow, painstaking construction of a case that required evidence, and the evidence had been walking through KL with packages in a daypack for five weeks, and Ahmad had given the evidence his card and the evidence had called twice and said nothing and the nothing was the silence of a man who wanted to speak but could not, and the silence was the last communication Ahmad would receive from Connor Briggs.

He looked at the letter. He looked at the report. The report said suicide. The letter said murder. The space between the report and the letter was the space in which the truth lived, the truth that was not in any document yet but would be, in time, when the investigation that Ahmad was about to initiate worked its way through the evidence -- the guard's absence, the cellmate's background, the towel that should not have been in the cell, the timing that was too convenient, the pattern that matched other deaths in other cells.

Ahmad picked up his phone. He called Razak.

"Encik Razak. This is Sergeant Ahmad. I received your messages. I received the letter from London. I received the photographs from the journalist."

A pause on the line. The pause of a man who had been calling and calling and had finally been answered, the pause of a man who knew that the answering was too late but also knew that too late was not the same as never.

"He's dead," Razak said. Not a question.

"He's dead."

"It wasn't suicide."

"No."

The two men held the line. The line carried nothing for several seconds -- no words, no sounds, just the electronic connection between a police station and a hostel three kilometres apart, the connection that represented the gap between the system that should have protected Connor and the building that had tried to warn him, the gap that was seventeen hours wide and would never be closed.

"I'm opening a murder investigation," Ahmad said. "The evidence from London, from the journalist, from your records -- it's enough to move on Felix Decker's network. I'll need your full cooperation. Yours, the receptionist, the cook, anyone who saw anything."

"You'll have it."

"The investigation will expose the hostel. The arrangement you had with Decker. Your knowledge. Your complicity."

"I know."

"You understand what that means."

"I understand. I've understood since the first mule. Since Nurul. Since I chose money over conscience and the choice cost a girl her freedom and now it's cost a boy his life. I understand, Sergeant. I'm ready."

Ahmad hung up. He opened a new case file on his computer. The case file was the beginning of the investigation, the first document in what would become a stack of documents -- reports, statements, photographs, forensic analyses, phone records, bank records, CCTV footage -- the bureaucratic mass of an investigation that would take months and would result in the arrest of Wei and three of the network's contacts and the issuance of an international warrant for Felix Decker and the prosecution of Guard Hafiz for accepting a bribe and the reopening of the death as a homicide and the identification of Rizal through fingerprint analysis and the eventual, partial, insufficient accounting of what had happened to Connor Briggs in a cell at Dang Wangi on a Friday night in February.

The investigation would be partial because Felix would not be found. Felix would be in Cambodia by the time the warrant was issued. Felix would set up operations in a hostel in Phnom Penh, and the operations would recruit new mules, and the mules would be young and broke and lonely and the recruitment would follow the same pattern -- common room, beer, charm, envelope, package, suitcase -- and the pattern would repeat because the pattern was not Felix's invention but the pattern's own invention, the pattern existing independently of any single operator, the pattern reproducing itself in hostels and guesthouses across Southeast Asia the way a virus reproduced itself in cells, the host dying, the virus moving on.

But that was the future. That was months of police work and legal proceedings and the slow, grinding process of a system responding to its own failure. That was Part 5.

This was Part 4's end.

At the Lantern Hostel, Bed 7 was remade by noon on Saturday.

Mei Ling had stripped the sheets at 8 AM, after Razak's phone call, after the confirmation. She had folded the old sheets and placed them in the laundry bag -- the bag that was collected every Monday by a service that laundered the sheets and returned them fresh and the laundering erased every trace of every body that had slept on every sheet, the industrial cleaning that was the hostel's method of forgetting, the chemical process that converted a specific person's DNA and sweat and skin cells into a generic, clean, unoccupied fabric.

She had remade the bed with fresh sheets. White. The standard hostel white that was the colour of absence, the colour of a surface waiting for an occupant, the colour of potential rather than history.

The bed was ready. The bed was available. The booking system showed: BED 7, DORM 3 -- VACANT.

By Saturday evening, Bed 7 had a new occupant. A French student, twenty-three, backpacking through Southeast Asia on a gap year before starting her master's degree in Lyon. She had booked the bed online for RM45 per night. She arrived at 6 PM with a large backpack and a smile and the particular, luminous confidence of a person who was experiencing Asia for the first time and finding everything extraordinary.

She climbed into Bed 7. She placed her hand on the wooden rail. Her fingers rested on the groove of a letter. She did not look at it. She did not feel it. The letter was L. The next letters were E, N, A.

She lay down. She pulled the hostel sheet over herself -- not a blue towel, not a Sea to Summit microfiber, but the white hostel sheet that was all that was available. She looked at the ceiling. The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

She fell asleep. Above her, through the air well, the stars were not visible -- the city's ambient light erased them, the permanent false dawn of KL's eight million lives generating enough luminosity to render the sky a flat orange-grey. But the stars were there. Behind the glow. Behind the haze. The stars that had been there when the building was built in 1928 and would be there when the building was gone.

The hostel breathed. The building absorbed the new occupant the way it absorbed everything -- silently, completely, without judgement. The building did not remember Connor Briggs. Buildings did not remember. Buildings held space and the space was filled and emptied and filled again and the filling and the emptying was the rhythm of the building's existence, the diastole and systole of a heart made of plaster and timber and tile.

But the name on the bed frame remained. LENA. Four letters. And the name that was not on the bed frame -- CONNOR, five letters -- was absent, and the absence was the only epitaph, the only mark, the only evidence that a man had slept in this bed and carried packages and loved a woman and eaten nasi lemak and looked at the Petronas Towers from a rooftop and called his mother not enough and been afraid and been brave and been neither and been both and been, in the end, gone.

The ceiling fan turned.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

The building breathed.

*End of Part 4: Climax*
# Chapter 41: The Official Version

## I. The Report

The police report was filed at 9:47 AM on Saturday, February 14th, Malaysian time.

The report was composed in Bahasa Melayu, the language in which the machinery of the state conducted its business. The language was formal, bureaucratic -- the specific dialect of Malay that existed only in government documents and police reports, the dialect that stripped events of their humanity and reduced them to facts. The facts were arranged in a sequence, the sequence presented as a narrative, the narrative presented as truth.

Report Number: DW/KL/2026/0847-M
Station: Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters
Filing Officer: Inspector Kamal bin Yusof
Date of Incident: February 14, 2026
Time of Discovery: 00:02 AM
Location: Holding Cell C-7, Ground Floor, Detention Wing

**Subject:** Death of a Foreign National While in Custody

The subject, one CONNOR JAMES BRIGGS, male, Australian citizen, passport number PA7834521, date of birth 14 March 1998, was arrested at 11:45 hours on February 13, 2026, at a Royal Malaysian Police checkpoint on the North-South Expressway (E1), between KM 226 and KM 227, near the Tapah interchange, Perak. The subject was apprehended following a positive alert by PDRM narcotics detection canine unit K-9 Handler Corporal Zainal bin Hamid on a black hardshell suitcase registered to the subject and stored in the luggage compartment of Transnasional service 1087, bound for Penang.

The report continued. The report was four pages. The report described, in the language of the report, the sequence of events that led from the arrest of Connor Briggs to the discovery of his body in Cell C-7. The language was precise. The language was clinical. The language performed the function that language performed in all official documents -- the conversion of chaos into order, of suffering into syntax, of death into data.

What the report said:

The subject was transported to Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters and processed at 15:08 hours. The subject's personal effects were catalogued and secured. The subject was placed in Holding Cell C-7 pending formal charge proceedings scheduled for 09:00 hours on February 14. At 21:45 hours, a second detainee, one MOHD RIZAL BIN AHMAD, male, Malaysian citizen, IC number 890412-14-5567, arrested at 19:30 hours on a charge of assault (Section 323 of the Penal Code), was placed in Holding Cell C-7. At 00:02 hours on February 14, Guard Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor, conducting a routine check, discovered the subject hanging from the upper horizontal bar of the cell gate by means of a microfiber towel (colour: blue, brand: Sea to Summit) knotted around his neck. Emergency medical response was initiated. The subject was pronounced dead at 01:05 hours by attending medical officer Dr. Faizah binti Abdul Rahman. Cause of death: asphyxiation due to ligature compression of the neck, consistent with hanging. Manner of death: suicide.

What the report did not say:

The report did not say that the blue towel should not have been in the cell. Malaysian police holding cell protocol -- Standard Operating Procedure 14.2.3, Detention of Persons Pending Charge -- required the removal of all items that could be used as ligatures. Belts, shoelaces, drawstrings, scarves, towels. The protocol existed because people in custody died by hanging and the hanging was prevented by the removal of the means. The protocol was clear. The protocol was printed on a laminated card attached to the wall of the processing room. The protocol was taught in police training. The protocol had been in place since 2012, when a review of deaths in custody had identified ligature access as a preventable risk factor. The protocol said: remove the towel. The guard who processed Connor had not removed the towel. The guard who processed Connor was Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor, who was also the guard who discovered the body, who was also the guard who took a forty-minute bathroom break during his shift, who was also the guard whose bank account would show a deposit of RM5,000 from an untraceable source at 11:47 PM on February 13.

The report did not mention this deposit.

The report did not say that Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad's identity card number corresponded to a man who had been arrested and released from police custody four times in the past eighteen months, each time for minor offences, each time placed in a holding cell with another prisoner, and each time the other prisoner had been found dead within twelve hours. The four deaths had occurred in four different police stations across Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. All four were classified as suicides. All four involved ligatures that should not have been in the cells. All four occurred during guard shift changes or guard absences. The pattern was there. The pattern was in the system. The system had not seen it because the system was not designed to see its own patterns, the way a mirror was not designed to reflect itself.

The report did not mention Rizal's history.

The report did not say that Rizal had been released from custody at 04:30 AM on February 14, approximately two hours after the body was discovered, on the authority of Inspector Kamal bin Yusof -- the same inspector who filed the report. Rizal's release was processed as standard -- charges dropped, insufficient evidence, no further action. The release form was signed. The form was filed. Rizal walked out of Dang Wangi into the pre-dawn darkness and was collected by a silver Toyota Vios with no plates that had been waiting on Jalan Dang Wangi since midnight.

The report did not mention the silver Toyota Vios.

The report did not say that Felix Decker, German national, passport number C47FH1002, had boarded Malaysia Airlines flight MH752 from KLIA to Phnom Penh at 04:15 AM on February 14, approximately fifteen minutes before the body was officially discovered. The flight had been booked three days earlier, on February 11, the day Connor had picked up the black suitcase from Felix's room. Felix had paid for the ticket with a prepaid Visa card purchased at a 7-Eleven on Jalan Bukit Bintang. The card was registered to a name that was not Felix Decker. The name on the card was Martin Vogt, and Martin Vogt did not exist.

The report did not mention Felix Decker.

The report was four pages. The report was complete. The report was filed. The report was the official version -- the version that would be transmitted to the Australian High Commission, the version that would be cited in the death certificate, the version that would be referenced by the media, the version that would reach Connor's parents in Hawthorn and would be the first account they would read of how their son had died. The official version was the version that said: suicide. The official version was the version that said: the man was despondent. The official version was the version that said: the system functioned as designed.

The system had functioned as designed. The design was the problem.

## II. The Article

The article appeared in the Saturday edition of The Star, Malaysia's largest English-language daily newspaper.

The article was on page seven. Page seven was the page where news went to die -- not the front page, where the headlines lived, not the national news section on pages two through four, not the business section or the sports section or the entertainment section where readers' eyes naturally fell, but page seven, the interstitial page, the page between the news that mattered and the news that didn't, the page where a reader's attention was diffuse, scanning, unlikely to settle.

The article was six paragraphs. The article occupied approximately twelve square centimetres of newsprint, nestled between an advertisement for a condominium development in Shah Alam and a three-paragraph item about a water main break in Kepong. The article had no photograph. The article had a headline:

**FOREIGN NATIONAL DIES IN POLICE CUSTODY**

The article read:

*KUALA LUMPUR -- An Australian national was found dead in a holding cell at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters early yesterday morning, police confirmed.*

*Connor James Briggs, 27, of Melbourne, Australia, was discovered by a police constable during a routine check at approximately 2:17 AM on Friday. He was pronounced dead at the scene.*

*Briggs had been arrested on Thursday afternoon at a police checkpoint on the North-South Expressway in Perak on suspicion of drug trafficking. Police reportedly seized 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in a suitcase in the luggage compartment of an express bus bound for Penang.*

*Under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, possession of more than 50 grams of methamphetamine carries the mandatory death penalty upon conviction.*

*Police said the cause of death was suicide by hanging. The Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur has been notified.*

*An investigation into the death is being conducted in accordance with standard procedures for deaths in custody.*

Six paragraphs. One hundred and forty-seven words. The entirety of Connor Briggs's life and death, compressed into a space smaller than the advertisement for the condominium in Shah Alam. The condominium advertisement promised "luxury living from RM450,000" and featured a photograph of a swimming pool and a smiling family. The advertisement occupied three times the space of Connor's death. The advertisement would be seen by more people. The advertisement would be remembered longer. The property developer had paid for the space. Connor's death had not.

The article was accurate. Every fact was a fact. The name was spelled correctly. The age, the nationality, the charge, the legal reference -- all correct. The word "suicide" was in the article because the word was in the police report and the police report was the source and the source was the system and the system had said suicide.

The article was accurate and the article was a lie.

The lie was not in what the article said. The lie was in what the article was. The article was a container -- a vessel shaped to hold a specific volume of truth, and the volume was six paragraphs, and the six paragraphs were the space that the editor had allocated to the death of a foreign national in police custody, and the allocation was a judgment, and the judgment was: this story is worth twelve square centimetres. The judgment was: this death is page seven. The judgment was: this man is one hundred and forty-seven words.

The lie was in the judgment. The lie was in the decision that this death -- a death involving a towel that should not have been in a cell, a cellmate who had been in four other cells with four other dead prisoners, a guard who took a bribe, a trafficking network that operated out of a hostel in Chinatown, a German national who fled to Cambodia, a British-Indian medical student who had written a letter naming every person involved, a Japanese photojournalist who had fifty-nine photographs on a server in Tokyo, a hostel owner who was ready to confess, a cook whose niece was in prison for the same crime -- the lie was in the decision that all of this was worth one hundred and forty-seven words on page seven, between a condominium and a water main.

But the article existed. The article was printed. The article was delivered to 300,000 households across Malaysia and was available on The Star's website, where it would accumulate forty-three page views in its first week, thirty-one of them from Malaysia, four from Australia, three from the United Kingdom, two from Japan, one from Germany, one from Cambodia, and one from an IP address that could not be geolocated because it was routed through a VPN that bounced the signal through seven countries before arriving at the article, the digital equivalent of a person standing at the back of a room, watching, unidentifiable.

The article was not the story. The article was the shadow of the story. But shadows were evidence of objects, and the object that cast this shadow was large, and the shadow, though it appeared on page seven in twelve square centimetres, was the first public mark of a death that would not remain on page seven, that would migrate forward through the pages as the investigation progressed, that would eventually reach page one when the warrants were issued and the arrests were made and the word "suicide" was replaced by the word "murder" and the twelve square centimetres became twelve hundred and the one hundred and forty-seven words became fourteen thousand.

But that was later. That was weeks of police work and legal proceedings. On Saturday, February 15, the article was six paragraphs on page seven, and the six paragraphs were all that the public knew, and the public turned the page.

## III. The Commission

The Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur occupied the sixth floor of a modern tower on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng, four kilometres from Dang Wangi, eleven kilometres from the Lantern Hostel, twelve thousand kilometres from Hawthorn. The building was glass and steel, the architecture of diplomacy, the design language that said: we are here, we are permanent, we represent a nation.

Sarah Chen arrived at her desk at 8:00 AM on Saturday. She had been the one who made the call to Hawthorn. She had been the duty consular officer, which meant she was the person whose phone rang when an Australian died abroad after hours, the person who converted the information from the police report into the language of human communication, the person who said the words to the parents. She had said the words to David Briggs at 3 AM Melbourne time. She had held the silence after the words. She had heard the sound that Karen made. She had held that silence too.

She had made fourteen of these calls in her three years at the High Commission. Drownings in Langkawi. A motorcycle accident in Penang. A heart attack in the Cameron Highlands. A stabbing in Kuala Terengganu. Each call had its own geography of grief -- the arrangement of information and silence, the parental response that was, in its broad contours, always the same but in its details always unique, the way that waves were always waves but no two waves were identical.

Connor Briggs was not the first drug-related death. Two years ago, a woman from Perth, twenty-four, had been found dead in a Kota Bharu hotel room, an overdose of heroin that had been sold to her as something milder. The call to the parents in Perth had been different -- the father had been angry, the mother had been silent, the silence of a woman who had expected this call, who had been waiting for it, who had known that her daughter's trajectory was asymptotic to zero and that the asymptote would be reached in a room somewhere foreign.

Connor Briggs's parents had not expected this call. Their geography of grief was shock -- the impossibility of a reality that did not match the one they had been living in, the one sustained by monthly phone calls and Instagram posts and the $2,000 that arrived in his account and kept the fiction viable.

Sarah Chen opened her computer. The computer contained the templates -- the forms, letters, and notifications that constituted the bureaucratic architecture of repatriation. The architecture had been built over decades, one death at a time, each death adding a form or a contact that hadn't existed before. A monument built not of stone but of paperwork.

The paperwork for Connor Briggs: Consular Death Report. Request for Local Death Certificate. Authorisation for Repatriation of Remains -- the document that would move Connor's body from Hospital KL to a zinc-lined coffin in the cargo hold of a Qantas flight to Melbourne, classified as "human remains" and accompanied by a sanitary certificate and a customs declaration. Family Liaison Assignment.

Four documents. Four templates. Each one representing a gap in the system that a previous death had revealed and filled. Sarah Chen opened the first template. Connor Briggs would be Row 1,247 in the Department's spreadsheet of Australian deaths abroad.

She would meet the parents. She would accompany them to the morgue. She would answer their questions with the answers in the police report, the answers that said suicide.

She would not tell them that she didn't believe the report. In three years at the High Commission, she had processed three deaths in custody. All three classified as suicide. All three exhibiting the same pattern -- a ligature that should not have been present, a guard's absence, a cellmate released shortly after the death. She would not tell them because telling them was not her function. Her function was consular assistance. Her function was paperwork. The process did not include the expression of personal doubts about the official report that the process was built upon.

She began to type.

Name of deceased: BRIGGS, Connor James.
Date of birth: 14/03/1998.
Date of death: 14/02/2026.
Place of death: Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Cause of death: Suicide by hanging (per Malaysian Police Report DW/KL/2026/0847-M).
Next of kin: David Arthur Briggs (father), Karen Louise Briggs (mother).
Address of next of kin: 47 Auburn Road, Hawthorn, Victoria 3122, Australia.

She typed the information and the typing was mechanical, the fingers moving on the keys the way they had moved for fourteen deaths before this one, the rhythm of the data entry unaltered by the content of the data, the fingers not knowing or caring that the name they typed belonged to a person who had been alive fifty-six hours ago, a person who had surfed and laughed and eaten nasi lemak and called his mother not enough and carried packages through the streets of a city that he had never understood and died in a cell with a towel around his neck and a word on his lips that the report did not record because the report did not record last words, the report recording only the facts, and the facts were the facts that the system produced, and the system had produced suicide.

She saved the document. She opened the next template.

The bureaucracy of death continued. The bureaucracy was patient. The bureaucracy had all the time in the world.

## IV. The Hostel

At the Lantern Hostel, on Petaling Street, in Chinatown, in Kuala Lumpur, the morning of Saturday, February 15th began the way every morning began.

The call to prayer from Masjid Jamek at 5:32 AM, the sound travelling across the rooftops and through the air well and into the rooms where the building's guests slept or did not sleep, the sound that was both alarm clock and invocation, both practical and spiritual, both of the world and above it. The sound that Connor had heard every morning for forty-six mornings and had never once identified as a call to prayer, had never once asked what it was, had absorbed it as ambient noise the way he absorbed everything about the city -- as backdrop, as atmosphere, as content.

The sound entered the building and the building received it. The building had been receiving this sound since 1928. The building would continue receiving it after everyone currently in it was gone.

Mei Ling opened the reception desk at 7:00 AM. She turned on the computer. She checked the booking system. Three new arrivals today: a German couple from Munich (Dorm 1, Beds 3 and 4) and a solo French student (Dorm 3, Bed 7). The French student had booked last night, online, from a hostel in Singapore where she was completing a three-day stay before continuing north through Malaysia.

Mei Ling looked at the booking. Dorm 3, Bed 7. The bed that had been stripped and remade twelve hours ago. The bed where Connor had slept for forty-six nights. The bed where Lena had slept before him. The bed where Nurul had slept before Lena. The bed that was, in the booking system, simply a bed -- a horizontal surface, a mattress, a set of coordinates in a database, available, bookable, occupiable.

She processed the booking. She assigned the bed. The system did not flag the bed. The system did not note that its previous three occupants had been arrested for drug trafficking, that one was dead, one was in prison, one was awaiting trial. The system did not note these things because the system was a booking system and booking systems tracked occupancy, not outcomes. The system knew that Bed 7 was vacant. The system did not know why.

Mama Siti arrived in the kitchen at 6:30 AM. She arrived the way she always arrived -- through the back entrance, the narrow door that opened onto the alley behind the building, the door that she had been using for thirty years, the door whose key she kept on a string around her neck, the string and the key both so old that they had become part of her body, an extension of her anatomy, the way a surgeon's scalpel became an extension of the hand.

She began cooking. Nasi lemak. The rice soaked since 4:00 AM -- she had come in early, as she did every day, to set the rice in the coconut milk, the rice and the milk beginning their slow fusion in the dark kitchen while the city slept. Now she lit the stove. The blue flame caught. The pot went on. The sambal was already made -- ground the night before, the chillies and the shallots and the belacan pounded in the stone mortar that had been in the kitchen since before the kitchen was a kitchen, since the building was a gambling den, possibly since the building was something worse. The sambal was red. The sambal was always red.

She cooked the ikan bilis. The tiny dried anchovies fried in oil until they were golden and crisp, the smell rising through the kitchen and into the air well and up through the building, the smell that was the hostel's morning signature, the olfactory equivalent of the call to prayer -- the announcement that the day had begun, that food was available, that the building was offering sustenance to its occupants.

At 7:15 AM, when the rice was cooked and the sambal was warm and the ikan bilis were drained and the cucumber was sliced and the egg was fried, Mama Siti prepared a plate. She prepared it with the same care she prepared every plate -- the rice moulded on the banana leaf, the sambal in its red comma beside the rice, the ikan bilis scattered like punctuation, the cucumber in its crescent, the egg with its lace edges.

She placed the plate on the counter. She placed it at the end of the counter, the position where Connor had stood every morning, the position that was between the coffee station and the bread toaster, the position that Connor had occupied because it was closest to the charging outlet where he plugged in his phone while he ate. The position was not marked. The position was not labelled. The position was simply the place where Connor stood, and the plate was placed there because the plate was for Connor, and Connor was dead, and the plate was for Connor anyway.

No one claimed the plate.

At 8:00 AM, the German couple from Dorm 1 came down and took plates from the stack and served themselves from the communal tray of nasi lemak that Mama Siti had prepared for the guests. They did not take the plate on the counter. The plate on the counter was not part of the communal offering. The plate on the counter was separate, individual, prepared for a specific person. The couple did not know this. The couple did not know that a specific person had existed or that the specific person was absent or that the absence was permanent. The couple ate their breakfast and discussed whether to visit the Batu Caves or the Petronas Towers. They chose the towers.

At 9:00 AM, a backpacker from Dorm 2 -- a Canadian, twenty-one, on his first trip abroad -- came down and saw the plate and reached for it.

"That one is taken," Mei Ling said from the reception desk. She said it without looking up. She said it in the flat, informational tone of a receptionist communicating a policy. The Canadian withdrew his hand and served himself from the communal tray.

The plate sat on the counter. The rice cooled. The sambal developed a thin film. The ikan bilis softened in the humidity. The egg's yolk set to solid. The plate was a plate of food that had been prepared for a person who would not eat it, and the preparation was not rational and was not intended to be rational. The preparation was ritual. The preparation was Mama Siti's grammar of grief -- the language she spoke when Bahasa Melayu and English were insufficient, the language of cooking for the dead, the language that said: *you were here, you ate what I made, the making was my caring, and the caring does not stop because you have stopped*.

At noon, Mama Siti cleared the plate. She scraped the food into the bin. She washed the plate. She dried it. She placed it back in the stack.

The next morning, Sunday, she prepared the plate again. Same position on the counter. Same arrangement. Same care. No one claimed it. At noon, she cleared it.

Monday: the plate. The counter. Noon. Cleared.

Tuesday: the plate. The counter. Noon. Cleared.

This continued for seven days. Seven plates of nasi lemak, prepared and unclaimed and cleared. Seven mornings of rice moulded on banana leaf and sambal in its red comma and ikan bilis scattered and cucumber in its crescent and egg with its lace edges. Seven noons of scraping and washing and drying and stacking.

On the eighth day, a Sunday, Mama Siti prepared the plate. She placed it on the counter. She stood beside it. She looked at it the way she had looked at Connor on the rooftop -- the direct, unfiltered look of a woman who had abandoned indirection.

She spoke. She spoke in Malay, quietly, to the plate, to the counter, to the position where Connor had stood, to the air that had once contained him and now did not.

"*Pergi dengan selamat*," she said. *Go safely.*

She picked up the plate. She carried it to the air well -- the open courtyard at the centre of the building, the space where the sky was visible above and the mosaic tile bench sat below and the laundry lines crossed like the strings of an instrument. She placed the plate on the mosaic bench. She left it there.

The plate sat in the air well for the rest of the day. The afternoon rain came at 3 PM -- the daily equatorial thunderstorm, the deluge that dropped from the visible sky through the open air well and hammered the tiles and the bench and the plate, the rain dissolving the rice and washing the sambal into a red streak across the mosaic and scattering the ikan bilis and lifting the egg and carrying everything into the drain at the corner of the courtyard, the drain that led to the pipes that led to the river that led to the Strait of Malacca that led to the sea.

The plate was empty after the rain. The plate was clean. The rain had done what Mama Siti's hands had done for seven days but with the finality that hands could not provide, the finality of the natural world performing the function that ritual had been performing, the function of clearing, of completing, of ending.

Mama Siti collected the plate. She brought it inside. She washed it, though the rain had already washed it. She dried it. She placed it in the stack.

She did not prepare the plate on the ninth day.

The position at the counter remained empty. The charging outlet was used by other phones. The mornings continued. The nasi lemak was served from the communal tray. The building performed normalcy.

But the staff knew. Mei Ling knew, and her knowing was in the way she looked at Dorm 3's door each time she walked past it, the look that lasted a fraction of a second longer than a look at any other door, the fraction that was the distance between routine and memory. Uncle Razak knew, and his knowing was in the new red pin on his map -- the pin that was placed on the map of Kuala Lumpur, not on the map of world hostels but on a separate map, a new map, a map of just this city, just this building, a map that had only one pin, the pin that said: *here, this one, this was ours*.

Aziz knew. Aziz, who had fixed the fan in Connor's dorm and opened his mouth to speak and closed it and left. Aziz, who had been a police officer and had lost his career to the act of speaking. Aziz stood in the alley behind the building and smoked and the smoking was the same as it always was but the standing was different, the standing was heavier, the standing of a man who had added another silence to the collection of silences that he carried, the collection that had begun with the silence that cost him his badge and had grown, silence by silence, into the weight that pressed him against the wall of the alley, the weight that was invisible and permanent and the precise weight of the words he had not said to Connor Briggs on Day 6 when he stood in the doorway of Dorm 3 and opened his mouth and closed it.

The French student arrived at 6 PM. She checked in. She climbed the narrow staircase. She entered Dorm 3. She found Bed 7. She put her backpack on the bed. She looked around the room -- the ceiling fan, the air well window, the bunks, the lockers, the peeling paint, the red lantern glow from the corridor. She smiled. The room was perfect. The room was exactly what she had hoped for -- authentic, atmospheric, the real Southeast Asian hostel experience, the kind of place that had stories.

She climbed into bed. She pulled the sheet over herself. Her hand rested on the wooden rail.

She did not feel the letters carved into the wood. She did not read them. She did not know that beneath her fingertips was the name of a Swedish woman who had slept in this bed and carried packages for a charming man and been arrested and imprisoned and whose name was the bed's only memory, the only mark left by the procession of bodies that had occupied this specific horizontal surface.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

Outside, the city hummed. The neon signs of Petaling Street cast their colours on the wet pavement. The smell of char kway teow rose from the hawker stalls. The call to prayer from Masjid Jamek would come at 5:32 AM. The nasi lemak would be ready by 7:15 AM. The communal tray would be full. The counter position would be empty.

The hostel was open. The hostel was operational. The hostel was accepting guests.

Check-in was at 2 PM. Check-out was at 11 AM. The rules were posted in four languages. The wifi password was on the whiteboard behind reception. The house rules were clear, and the last rule, the one written in red at the bottom of the laminated card, the one that Connor had never read, the one that was the building's only explicit warning, was still there:

*Guests are responsible for knowing and obeying Malaysian law. The hostel is not liable.*

The building breathed. The lanterns glowed. The air well was dark and wet from the afternoon rain. The mosaic bench held no plate. The drain at the corner held the faintest trace of sambal, a red residue that the rain had not fully washed away, a mark that would be gone by morning but was, for now, still visible -- the colour of chillies and the colour of blood and the colour of lanterns, the red that was the building's signature, the red that meant warmth and welcome and warning, the red that said: *come in, the door is open, the bed is ready, the price is listed, the law is posted, the rest is up to you*.

*End of Chapter 41*
# Chapter 42: Priya's War

The flat in Bermondsey was cold.

Not the cold of Kuala Lumpur's air conditioning, which was the cold of machines -- the aggressive, artificial chill that Malaysian buildings deployed against the equatorial heat, the cold that hit like a wall when you walked through a door and announced that you had crossed from outside to inside, from the natural world to the institutional one. This was a different cold. This was London cold. February cold. The cold of a city that existed at fifty-one degrees north and had been grey since October and would remain grey until April and the greyness was not an absence of colour but a colour itself, the pervasive, suffocating grey that was London's contribution to the emotional spectrum, the grey that entered buildings through single-glazed windows and settled on surfaces and on people and on the interior architecture of the mind.

Priya Sharma sat at the kitchen table in the flat she shared with two other medical students in a converted warehouse on Tanner Street, SE1, and the table was covered with paper.

The paper was the evidence. The paper was the reconstruction. The paper was the project that she had been building since she landed at Heathrow thirty hours ago, since she cleared customs and turned on her phone and found three missed calls from Tomoko and two from a Malaysian number she didn't recognise and a text from Razak that said only *Priya. Call me now.* and she had stood in the arrivals hall at Terminal 4 with the phone pressed to her ear and the crowds flowing around her and Razak had told her and the telling had taken forty-seven seconds and in those forty-seven seconds the world had changed, the atoms of the world had rearranged themselves into a configuration that did not include Connor Briggs alive on the earth, and the rearrangement had activated something in her that was not grief, not yet, not the grief that would come later when the adrenaline subsided and the project was done and there was nothing left to build, but something harder, something colder, something that her medical training had given a vocabulary for but that no training could prepare a person to feel.

"Dead," Razak had said. "In the cell. Last night. The police are saying suicide."

She had stood in arrivals. The arrivals hall at Heathrow Terminal 4 smelled of jet fuel and floor polish and the accumulated exhalation of a thousand passengers. A family was reuniting next to her -- a man lifting a child, a woman crying with happiness, the sound of the happy crying entering Priya's ears at the same moment as the word *dead* and the two sounds existing simultaneously in the same airspace, the sound of reunion and the sound of permanent separation occupying the same cubic centimetre of air.

She had not cried then. She had not cried in the taxi home. She had cried at 2:17 AM, alone in her bedroom, when she had written the words *Feb 14, 02:17 AM MYT -- body discovered in Cell C-7* and the specificity of the time had broken something that the word *dead* had not broken, because the word was abstract and the time was specific and the cell number was a location -- a three-by-three-metre concrete room with a fluorescent light that never turned off -- and she had been asleep on a plane over the Bay of Bengal at 2:17 AM and she had been asleep while he was dying and the sleeping was the thing that undid her, the sleeping was the betrayal, the failure of her body to know across eleven time zones that the person she loved was fighting for his life in a cell in Dang Wangi.

She was a fourth-year medical student at King's College London. She had completed rotations in emergency medicine, in surgery, in oncology. She had seen death in the clinical context -- the controlled, documented, institutionally managed cessation of life that occurred in hospitals. She had held the hand of an eighty-four-year-old man in his final hours because his family was in traffic on the M25 and someone needed to be there.

She understood death. The physiology. The bureaucracy. The paperwork.

The understanding made the emotional understanding worse.

Because she knew what ligature strangulation did to the body -- the compression of the carotid arteries, the loss of consciousness in eight to twelve seconds, the irreversible brain damage in four to six minutes. She knew the physical sensations -- the pressure, the panic, the involuntary struggle, the narrowing of vision. She knew these things because she had studied them, and the knowledge that had been abstract and academic was now specific and personal and applied to a throat she had kissed, to a neck she had rested her head against on a rooftop in Kuala Lumpur while the Petronas Towers glittered and he had said something stupid and wonderful and she had laughed and the laughing had been the sound of a woman falling in love with a man she knew was doomed and could not stop falling because love did not consult the evidence before making its decisions.

She knew what the towel had done. She knew the timeline -- the seconds, the minutes, the physiological stages. She could narrate the death with medical precision, and the precision was a knife, and the knife was inside her, and the knife turned every time she thought about the blue towel, the blue Sea to Summit microfiber towel that he had hung on the bunk rail every night and that she had used once, wrapped around herself after a shower in the hostel's perpetually damp bathroom, the towel that had smelled of sunscreen and salt water and him.

The jade bracelet on her left wrist caught the grey light from the kitchen window. The bracelet was green -- the deep, cool, translucent green of nephrite jade, the green that the night market vendor had called *lucky green, very good fortune*, the green that Connor had pointed to and said "That one, the green one, it matches her" and had paid forty ringgit for without bargaining, the only time in six weeks that Connor Briggs had not bargained, the only purchase he had made in Malaysia where the price asked was the price paid, because the bracelet was for her and for her the rules were different and the difference was love and the love was the thing she wore on her wrist and could not remove because removing it would be an ending and she was not ready for endings.

The bracelet was cool against her skin. The bracelet was always cool. Jade held the temperature of its environment, and the environment was a flat in Bermondsey in February, and the temperature was cold.

The grief would come. The grief was already coming -- she could feel it in the periphery, the way you could feel a migraine approaching before it arrived, the aura that preceded the pain. But not yet. The grief was being held at bay by the project, by the paper on the table, by the work.

---

The paper on the table was arranged in columns. The columns were chronological. The columns were labelled in Priya's handwriting -- small, precise, the handwriting of a medical student who had learned that legibility was not optional.

Column 1: DATES. Every date that mattered, from Connor's arrival at the Lantern Hostel (Day 1, January 1) to his death (Day 47, February 14). Forty-seven days, each one a row, each row annotated with what she knew had happened.

Column 2: DELIVERIES. Every delivery she had confirmed or suspected. Day 6: envelope to Bukit Bintang. Day 9: package to Brickfields. Day 11 onwards: scheduled deliveries, locations listed where known. Day 47: suitcase, bus to Penang, 450 grams of methamphetamine.

Column 3: PEOPLE. Felix Decker. Wei. Rizal. Guard Hafiz. Inspector Kamal. Every name Connor had mentioned to her, every name she had overheard, every name she had inferred from three weeks of watching a man she loved walk deeper into something she couldn't name but could feel.

Column 4: EVIDENCE. Tomoko's photographs. Mei Ling's booking records. Razak's cooperation. Connor's own Instagram -- @ConnorGoesGlobal, 4,200 followers, the curated digital life of a man who had documented his own entrapment in sunset filters and nine-hashtag captions without knowing it. The @HostelReaper posts. Connor's bank records. Felix's flight record (MH752, KL to Phnom Penh, 04:15 AM, February 14, the same morning, the same hours).

Column 5: WHAT THE REPORT SAYS. Suicide while in custody.

Column 6: WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Murder.

She adjusted her glasses. She had been wearing her glasses for thirty hours straight because her eyes were too swollen from the 2:17 AM crying to tolerate contact lenses, the crying that happened in bursts, unpredictable, the body releasing grief in controlled detonations while the mind continued working, one building and one destroying, one constructing the case and one processing the loss.

She picked up her phone.

---

The call to Sergeant Ahmad connected on the fourth ring.

"Pejabat Polis Dang Wangi. Sergeant Ahmad."

"Sergeant Ahmad, this is Priya Sharma. I sent you a letter. From London. About Connor Briggs and the Lantern Hostel."

Half a second of silence. Priya heard him shift in his chair, heard the ambient noise of the police station -- the phones, the footsteps, the hum of air conditioning -- and within the ambient noise, the specific silence of a man who was about to have a conversation that he could not have freely but would have carefully.

"Miss Sharma. Yes. I received your letter. This morning."

"Then you know it wasn't suicide."

Another pause. This one longer. The length of the pause was the length of a man choosing his words with the precision that his position demanded, the precision that distinguished a statement from an implication, a fact from an opinion, an official position from a personal belief.

"I can confirm that an investigation has been opened into the circumstances of Mr. Briggs's death. I cannot provide details about the investigation at this time."

"He was murdered. In your station. In a cell in your station. By a man named Rizal who was placed in the cell to kill him, who used Connor's own towel -- a towel that should have been confiscated during processing under SOP 14.2.3 -- and who was released two hours after the body was discovered. The guard on duty took a bribe. The report was filed by the same inspector who authorised Rizal's release. Felix Decker, the man who recruited Connor into the trafficking network, boarded a flight to Cambodia before the body was officially found."

The silence that followed was not the silence of a man who was hearing new information. The silence was the silence of a man who was recalibrating his assessment of the person on the other end of the phone, the recalibration that occurred when a professional who had been evaluating people for twenty years encountered someone who had done the homework, who had the evidence, who was not the bereaved partner he might have expected but was instead a precise, controlled, furious intelligence pointing itself at his case like an instrument.

"Miss Sharma. I want to be clear about something. Off the record."

"I'm listening."

"The official report was filed by an officer who is not part of my division. The investigation I am conducting is separate. It is looking at the full circumstances -- the detention, the cell assignment, the guard's conduct, the cellmate's background, and the network. This investigation is active and it is progressing. But it takes time. Evidence must be gathered properly. Legal standards must be met. The people responsible -- all of them, not just the ones in the cell -- must be identified and charged through a process that will hold up in court. Do you understand?"

"I understand. I also understand that every day that passes is a day that Felix Decker spends in Cambodia and a day that the official report says suicide and a day that the truth stays on page seven."

The reference to page seven was deliberate. Tomoko had sent Priya a photograph of the article in The Star -- the article she had found online three hours after the phone call from Razak, the article she had found by searching "Connor Briggs Malaysia" and "death custody Dang Wangi" and "Australian drug trafficking KL," the searches producing a single result, a single article, six paragraphs on page seven of a Saturday newspaper, 147 words between a condominium advertisement and a water main break.

She had read the 147 words on her phone screen, the jade bracelet cold on her wrist, and the words had produced a sensation that was not grief and was not anger but was something between the two, something in the territory where the emotional response to injustice was indistinguishable from the emotional response to loss.

*FOREIGN NATIONAL DIES IN POLICE CUSTODY.* Six paragraphs. Connor James Briggs, 27, of Melbourne. Suicide by hanging. Standard procedures.

"Miss Sharma." Ahmad's voice was careful now, the careful of a man making a decision. "Please send your detailed statement to my direct email. Everything you have -- dates, names, locations, observations, documentation. Everything."

"I already have it prepared. Twelve pages. Single-spaced."

"Of course you do."

The sentence was not sarcasm. The sentence was recognition -- the first moment of professional respect between a Malaysian narcotics sergeant and a British-Indian medical student, the respect that emerged when two people who were separately pursuing the same truth discovered that their pursuits were converging.

"And Sergeant Ahmad -- I want you to know that I intend to contact SUARAM. And the press. And the families of previous victims, if the pattern is what I think it is."

A pause. The pause of a police officer weighing the utility of an activist against the complications of one.

"I cannot advise you on your personal actions, Miss Sharma. I can tell you that the investigation benefits from public pressure. Off the record."

"Understood."

She hung up. She sat at the table. She opened her laptop. The statement was already written -- twelve pages, the medical-student precision of every date, every delivery, every conversation, every warning ignored. The statement was not emotional. The statement was clinical. The statement was the anatomy of a murder, dissected and labelled with the same care that a medical student brought to the dissection of a cadaver.

She attached the document. She pressed send. The email left London at 11:47 AM GMT. It arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 7:47 PM MYT. It was the second piece of ammunition that Ahmad's investigation had received that day -- the first being Priya's letter, the letter she had posted at Heathrow before boarding her flight home, the letter that had arrived at Dang Wangi on the morning of February 14, seventeen hours before Connor's death was discovered, the letter that had been on time and too late simultaneously, the letter that was the right action at the wrong time.

---

The second call was to SUARAM.

SUARAM -- Suara Rakyat Malaysia, the Voice of the Malaysian People -- was a human rights organisation based in Petaling Jaya that had been documenting deaths in Malaysian police custody for thirty-seven years. Two hundred and fifty-seven documented cases since 2000. Priya had found them through a Google search at 2:00 AM, the night when sleep was not available and the alternative to sleep was research.

A case coordinator named Fatimah answered. Her voice carried not desensitisation but calibration -- the adjustment of the emotional register to a level that was empathetic without being overwhelmed, the register of a person who had heard this kind of call many times.

"SUARAM, Fatimah speaking."

"My name is Priya Sharma. I'm calling from London. My partner, Connor Briggs, was found dead in a holding cell at Dang Wangi police station on February 14th. The official report says suicide. It was murder."

Fatimah did not ask for proof. Fatimah said: "Tell me everything."

Priya told her. The telling took forty-seven minutes -- a minute per day, she would realise later, though the symmetry was a coincidence and not a plan. She told Fatimah about Felix, about the deliveries, about the escalation from envelope to package to backpack to suitcase, about the towel that should not have been in the cell, about the cellmate, about the guard's absence.

"The towel being in the cell is significant," Fatimah said. "SOP 14.2.3 requires removal of all ligature-risk items. In our records, sixty-three percent of hanging deaths in custody involved a ligature that should have been removed during processing. The failure is either negligence or complicity."

"I believe there are other victims. The same pattern. The same cellmate."

"We'll file a formal inquiry with the Inspector General of Police. We'll request the full incident report, the guard's duty log, the cell assignment records, and the release documentation. We'll also request the post-mortem -- the autopsy may contain evidence inconsistent with suicide."

Defensive injuries. The phrase activated the medical knowledge she had been both using and suffering from -- broken fingernails, abrasions from the victim's own hands trying to pull the ligature away, petechial haemorrhaging, bruising inconsistent with self-inflicted hanging. She knew Connor had fought. She knew this not from evidence but from knowing him, from knowing the body that had surfed and held her on a rooftop, the body that would not have submitted without the desperate, futile struggle that was the body's final argument against its own extinction.

"I'll send you everything I have," Priya said.

"And Miss Sharma -- the right to life is not conditional on innocence. Connor Briggs was entitled to the protection of the law. The law failed him."

Priya thanked her. She hung up. The flat in Bermondsey was still cold but the cold was now a background condition rather than a foreground sensation because the foreground was occupied by the sensation of mechanisms activating, of the process of accountability beginning to turn.

At 4:00 PM, Priya opened Connor's Instagram on her laptop.

@ConnorGoesGlobal. 4,200 followers. The last post: a selfie at a Petaling Street night market stall, the caption "KL, you absolute legend" and nine hashtags. The post had forty-seven likes. The post had been made six days before his death. The account was still live, still public, the digital ghost of a man who had curated his own trajectory toward destruction in golden-hour filters and #livingmybestlife captions.

She scrolled through the feed. The feed was a timeline no one had looked at yet because the feed was Instagram and Instagram was not where investigators looked. But the feed was evidence.

The early posts were the usual -- KLIA2 grin, Petronas Towers at sunset, nasi lemak with Mama Siti's hand at the frame's edge. The feed of a man becoming a city. Then:

Day 9: Connor and Felix on the rooftop. Felix's hand on Connor's shoulder. Caption: "New mate Felix. This bloke's been everywhere. Legend." Thirty-one likes, and not one of the thirty-one had looked at that hand and seen a handler establishing contact with a recruit.

Day 14: The jade bracelet on Priya's wrist, the jade green against her brown skin, the night market lights blurred behind. Caption: "She said she didn't want anything. I said the bracelet did." Forty-four likes. His most-liked post. The only one where the caption was not performing.

Day 38: the last photograph. A sunset from the hostel rooftop, no caption, no hashtags. Just the sky and the city and the silence of a man who had, perhaps, run out of words.

Priya took screenshots. Every post. Every photograph. Every caption. Every date. She organised them chronologically in a folder on her desktop. The folder was labelled CONNOR -- INSTAGRAM EVIDENCE. The folder would be sent to Ahmad, to SUARAM, to the journalist she was about to contact.

Then she opened a new browser tab. She logged into her own Instagram -- @priya.s.sharma, 312 followers, mostly medical school friends and family. She had not posted in three months. She did not use social media the way Connor had used it, the way a generation used it, as a mirror and a megaphone and a substitute for the interior life that the platform simultaneously demanded and destroyed.

She created a new post. The image was Connor's Day 14 photograph -- the jade bracelet on her wrist. She had saved it months ago, when he posted it, when she was still at the hostel, when she had seen it in her feed and had smiled and had not known that the photograph would become an artefact, a relic, the digital equivalent of a saint's bone, the evidence that a person had existed and had loved and had been loved.

The caption she wrote was not @ConnorGoesGlobal's voice. The caption was Priya's voice. The caption was precise and it was controlled and it was the opening salvo of a campaign that she was building in real time, the campaign that would give the machinery a name and the name would be a hashtag and the hashtag would be the thing that moved the story from page seven to the place where stories that mattered lived.

*Connor James Briggs, 27, from Melbourne, Australia, died on February 14, 2026, in a police holding cell at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur. The official report says suicide. It was not suicide. He was murdered.*

*Connor was my partner. Connor was a person -- not a case file, not a headline, not a statistic. He was kind and he was careless and he was loved. He was manipulated by a drug trafficking network that used him as a mule and then killed him when he was arrested because dead men can't testify.*

*The Malaysian police report is a lie. The 147-word article on page 7 of The Star is not the story. This is the story. Connor deserves the truth and the truth requires your attention.*

*#JusticeForConnor #DeathInCustody #ConnorBriggs #DangWangi*

She posted it. The post went live at 4:47 PM GMT, 12:47 AM MYT. The algorithm would decide whether a jade bracelet and a dead man and the word *murdered* constituted the kind of content that generated the engagement metrics the platform rewarded with visibility.

The algorithm decided yes.

By midnight the post had been shared 340 times. By morning, 2,100. The hashtag #JusticeForConnor appeared in the feeds of human rights organisations, travel bloggers, Australian media accounts, Malaysian civil society groups. A journalist from The Age in Melbourne screenshotted the post and wrote a 1,200-word article: "British Medical Student Claims Aussie Backpacker Was Murdered in Malaysian Custody." The article was on page three. The article named Felix Decker. The article quoted SUARAM. Twelve times the length of the 147-word piece in The Star.

Priya watched the numbers from her kitchen table. The accumulation of attention was a form of pressure, and the pressure was the thing that institutions responded to not because they had consciences but because they had public relations departments, and the metrics included the number of times an institution's name appeared in proximity to the word *murder*, and the number was rising.

---

The call to Karen Briggs was the hardest.

She had saved it for last. She had made the other calls first -- to Ahmad, to SUARAM, to the British consulate, to a journalist at The Star named Lim Wei Ling whose byline had appeared on the 147-word article -- she had made these calls because these calls had structure, because these calls had objectives, because these calls engaged the part of her brain that was trained and competent and capable. These calls were work. The call to Karen was not work. The call to Karen was the thing that no training prepared a person for.

She dialled the number. Connor had called his mother from Priya's phone once, on the rooftop, on a night when his phone was dead. He had dialled from memory -- the digits stored not in the phone but in the body, in the fingers that had dialled the number since childhood -- and Priya had seen the number on her call log and saved it, not knowing why.

Karen answered on the second ring. The speed of a woman answering every call because every call might contain new information.

"Hello?" The voice was stripped. Not the social voice, not the telephone voice. The voice that existed beneath all the other voices, produced when the social infrastructure had collapsed and all that remained was the mechanism -- the vocal cords, the breath, the words.

"Mrs. Briggs, this is Priya Sharma. I was... I knew Connor. In Kuala Lumpur."

"Priya." The name was spoken with recognition -- not from having met but from having been told. Connor had mentioned her to his mother on one of the Sunday calls, the calls he answered every third week, the curated, abbreviated narration that children used with parents, and Priya had been one of the good parts. "He told me about you. He said you were brilliant. He said you were the smartest person he'd ever met."

The information arrived in Priya's body and the processing produced the tears -- the involuntary release that occurred when the emotional stimulus exceeded the cognitive capacity. The tears were not a decision. The tears were a hydraulic event. She let them come because the tears were the body's way of doing what the mind could not, which was to acknowledge the magnitude of the loss.

"Karen. I need to tell you something about how Connor died. And I need you to listen, because what I'm going to tell you is different from what the police report says."

"I know." The words were immediate. The words were the words of a mother who had known since the phone call at 3 AM, who had heard the word *suicide* and had rejected it the way a body rejected a foreign organ, immediately, completely, at the cellular level. "I know it wasn't suicide. David knows. We both know. Connor would not have... he was not... he was many things, Priya, he was careless and stubborn and infuriating and he didn't listen, God knows he didn't listen, but he was not that. He wouldn't have."

"He didn't."

The two words travelled from London to Melbourne and the two words were the confirmation of what Karen already believed and the confirmation changed nothing and changed everything, the way a diagnosis changed nothing about the disease but changed everything about the patient's relationship to the disease, the naming of the thing giving the thing a shape that could be grasped and, eventually, fought.

Priya told her. The controlled, precise language. Felix. The deliveries. Rizal. The towel. The guard. The investigation. SUARAM. The statement.

Karen listened. Karen's listening was the listening of a mother -- the filter that converted every fact into a felt experience, every element of the story into a moment in the life of a child she had borne and raised and loved and worried about and sent money to and called every Sunday and not heard from often enough and lost.

When Priya finished, the silence was the silence of two women in two cities on two continents who loved the same man and who were both refusing to let the destruction be the end of the story.

"We're flying to KL," Karen said. "David and I. To bring him home."

"I know. The High Commission's Sarah Chen -- I've been in contact with her. She'll meet you."

"Will you be there?"

The question was the extension of a hand across twelve thousand kilometres. Priya looked at the jade bracelet on her wrist. She looked at the paper on the table. She looked at the grey February light pressing against the kitchen window.

"My term starts Monday. My clinical placements..."

"Of course. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have--"

"No. Wait." The word came before the decision, or perhaps the word was the decision, the body making the choice before the mind could intervene with logistics and obligations and the reasonable objections that reasonable people offered when unreasonable things were asked of them. "I'll come. I need to come. The evidence I have, the contacts -- Ahmad, SUARAM, Tomoko at the hostel -- I need to be there. I can defer the placement. I'll speak to my supervisor."

The decision was not rational. The decision was the decision of a woman who had sent a letter from Heathrow and the letter had arrived seventeen hours too late and the lateness was the thing she carried. She had left KL and Connor had died. The leaving was the thing she could not undo but could answer with the inverse action -- the return, the going back to the place where the loss had occurred to ensure that the loss was not also a silence.

"Thank you," Karen said. "Thank you."

"And Karen?"

"Yes?"

"He talked about you. Every day. Not on the phone -- on the phone he was performing. But in person, when it was just us, when it was late and he wasn't performing, he talked about you. Sunday roasts. The cricket on TV. Vegemite toast when he came home from school. He talked about you the way people talk about the thing they love most and are most afraid of losing."

The sound that Karen made was not the sound she had made in the hallway at 3 AM. That sound had been the sound of a mother learning her child was dead. This sound was different. This sound was the sound of a mother learning her child had loved her, had spoken of her with tenderness to a woman he cared about, had carried her in the part of himself that was not the Instagram persona, not the digital nomad, not @ConnorGoesGlobal, but the boy from Hawthorn who missed his mother's Vegemite toast.

The sound was private. Priya held it the way she had been trained to hold the sounds that patients made -- with presence, with silence, with the understanding that some sounds required not a response but a witness.

"Will they catch the people who did this?" Karen asked.

"I'm going to make sure of it."

The words were a declaration of intent made by a woman who had arranged the evidence on her kitchen table and made four phone calls and written a twelve-page statement and launched a hashtag that was, at this moment, converting the 147-word page-seven silence into noise, into visibility, into the pressure that moved stories from the margins to the centre.

Justice was not enough. Justice was never enough. Justice was the consolation prize that the living gave to the dead, the acknowledgement that the system had failed and the failure would be documented and the documentation would be called accountability -- partial, insufficient, necessary. Necessary because the alternative was nothing, and nothing was not acceptable, and the refusal to accept nothing was the engine that drove the campaign, the anger that Priya Sharma carried in her chest like a second heart, beating alongside the first, generating the energy that grief alone could not provide.

---

She hung up the phone. She sat at the table. The paper was still there. The columns were still there. The evidence was still there.

She opened her laptop. On the screen, the #JusticeForConnor post was accumulating. The numbers were rising. The system was responding. The story was migrating.

She opened a new email. The email was to Lim Wei Ling, the journalist at The Star. The email would be the beginning of a professional relationship that would last months, that would result in investigative articles that moved from page seven to page three to page one, that would name Felix Decker and the network and the pattern of deaths in custody, that would cite SUARAM's records and Priya's statement and Tomoko's photographs, that would force the Inspector General of Police to convene a special inquiry.

But that was the future. That was weeks and months of the slow, grinding process of a truth migrating from the margins to the centre, from 147 words to fourteen thousand.

For now, Priya typed. The flat was cold. The grey was at the windows. The jade bracelet was cool on her wrist. The paper was on the table. The second heart was beating.

She had a flight to book.

*End of Chapter 42*
# Chapter 43: The Investigation

## I. The Letter

The letter arrived at Dang Wangi at 7:47 PM on Saturday, February 15th -- seventeen hours after Connor Briggs was pronounced dead in Holding Cell C-7 on the ground floor of the same building in which Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail now sat, at his desk, on the second floor, in the narcotics division, reading the email that had travelled from a kitchen table in Bermondsey to his inbox in the time it took for a signal to cross eleven time zones, which was approximately one point four seconds, which was less time than it took for a man to lose consciousness under ligature compression, which was the fact that Ahmad's mind produced without his permission, the fact arriving the way facts arrived in the minds of police officers who had spent twenty years learning the technical specifications of death.

The email was from a woman named Priya Sharma. The email was twelve pages. The email was single-spaced. The email was, in its precision and its controlled fury, the most comprehensive witness statement Ahmad had received in his twenty years with the Royal Malaysia Police -- and the statement had not been written by a police officer or a prosecutor or a forensic investigator but by a fourth-year medical student at King's College London who was sitting in a cold flat six thousand miles away and who had assembled, from memory and observation and the careful accumulation of forty-seven days of paying attention, a document that mapped the entire architecture of a trafficking network operating out of a phone repair shop on Petaling Street.

Ahmad read the letter twice.

He read it once quickly, the way a man reads when the content is urgent and the time is limited -- the eyes scanning, the mind filtering for names and dates and locations, the executive summary that the brain performed automatically when confronted with a document that contained more information than could be processed in a single pass. The first reading yielded: Felix Decker. Wei. Rizal. Guard Hafiz. Inspector Kamal. The Lantern Hostel. The phone repair shop. The suitcase. The towel. The death that was not a suicide.

He read it a second time slowly. The second reading was the reading that mattered -- the reading in which the details emerged from between the facts, the reading in which the connections became visible, the reading in which the letter transformed from a statement into a map and the map showed him not just what had happened but how the system worked, the system that had recruited Connor Briggs and used him and killed him and filed a report that said suicide, the system that Ahmad had suspected existed but had lacked the external evidence to prove.

He had given Connor Briggs his card.

The memory surfaced from the spreadsheet he kept on the personal laptop at home -- the ThinkPad in the drawer beside his bed, password-protected, the laptop where he tracked the investigation that did not officially exist. In the notes column beside what would become Connor's row, he had written weeks earlier: *Checkpoint stop, Jalan Alor area, approx. January 20. Australian male, cooperative. Passport PA7734819. Advised caution. Gave card.* The card was one of four hundred and twelve that Ahmad had given out in six years -- his own cards, printed at his own expense at a shop in Brickfields, each bearing his name, his rank, his number, and a line in English and Bahasa Melayu that no official protocol required but that Ahmad had added because the system did not protect people and someone had to try:

*If you are in trouble with Malaysian law, call this number before you speak to anyone else.*

Connor had kept the card. Connor had placed it in his wallet beside his Australian driver's licence. And Priya's letter told Ahmad what happened next: Connor had dialled the number. In the final days, when the truth about what he was carrying had become undeniable, Connor had held the phone to his ear and heard the line connect and had hung up after three seconds -- three seconds in which Ahmad's phone had registered an incoming call from an unknown number and Ahmad had looked at the screen and let it ring because unknown numbers at midnight were usually nothing, wrong numbers or telemarketers or the noise of a telecommunications system producing its thousands of daily errant connections.

Three seconds. The width of the gap between a man asking for help and a man deciding not to. Three seconds that Ahmad would carry the way Priya carried the jade bracelet, the way Karen carried the silence at 3 AM -- the personal artefact of a near-miss that was worse than no contact because no contact was the absence of possibility and the three-second call was the presence of possibility that existed and expired.

Ahmad put the card back in the drawer. He closed the drawer.

He began to work.

---

## II. The Towel

The investigation began with Standard Operating Procedure 14.2.3.

Detention of Persons Pending Charge. Seventeen pages. Step 14 of the processing protocol: *All items presenting a risk of self-harm shall be removed from the detained person prior to placement in a holding cell. Items include but are not limited to: belts, shoelaces, drawstrings, scarves, lanyards, ropes, cables, towels, bedsheets, and any item of clothing or equipment that could be fashioned into a ligature.*

Towels. The word was in the protocol. The word was printed on the laminated card attached to the wall of the processing room, the card that every officer passed every time they processed a detainee, the card that was positioned at eye level, the card that was impossible to miss unless missing it was the intention.

Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor had processed Connor Briggs at 17:08 hours on February 13th. Hafiz had catalogued the belongings -- wallet, phone, sandals, bracelet -- and placed them in a plastic bag. The blue Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel was not in the bag. The processing log contained a marginal note in Hafiz's handwriting: *Towel left with detainee for comfort.* Two words in a margin. Either an act of kindness or an act of preparation. The determination of which would be the first thread that Ahmad pulled.

Ahmad pulled it on a Tuesday evening, six days after the letter arrived.

The pulling was not dramatic. The pulling was digital -- a number on a screen in a banking database, the result of a court order that Ahmad had obtained from a magistrate at the Kuala Lumpur Magistrate's Court, the order compelling Bank Negara Malaysia to provide transaction records for Savings Account 7142-8899-3301 at Maybank, Jalan Tun Perak branch, the account registered to Hafiz bin Mohd Noor.

At 10:47 PM on February 13, 2026 -- approximately an hour before Connor Briggs was found dead -- a deposit of RM5,000 had been made to the account. The deposit was via cash transfer at an ATM on Jalan Bukit Bintang, a machine that accepted deposits without a card, without identification, without the human intermediary of a teller window. Anonymous. Untraceable in the traditional sense.

But the deposit was there. RM5,000 in an account that had not received a deposit larger than RM2,800 -- Hafiz's monthly salary -- in the previous twelve months. The deposit was made on the night that Hafiz had left a towel in a cell where a towel should not have been, on the night that Hafiz had taken a forty-minute bathroom break during which the cell was unmonitored, on the night that Hafiz had returned to find a body and had filed a statement saying he discovered it during a routine check.

Ahmad printed the transaction record. He opened the CCTV footage from the custody corridor -- footage he had subpoenaed on Sunday, the day after the letter arrived, from the station's own surveillance system, the subpoena necessary because the footage was under Inspector Kamal's administrative control and Kamal had not included it in the original report. The subpoena bypassed Kamal. The subpoena was the legal instrument that allowed Ahmad to access evidence in his own building without the permission of the man who had reason to ensure the evidence was never seen.

The footage showed: at 23:15, Hafiz standing from his desk, removing his earbuds, walking toward the toilet at the end of the corridor. He did not return until 23:55. Forty minutes. The custody corridor was empty for forty minutes. Whatever happened in Cell C-7 happened without a witness whose testimony the investigation could compel.

The footage showed something else. At 04:27 AM -- approximately two hours after the body was discovered -- a man walked out of the custody wing through the rear door to the station car park. Medium build. Grey institutional tracksuit. The unhurried gait of a person who was not fleeing but departing, not escaping but being released. Ahmad tracked the man through the external cameras: across the car park, through the rear gate -- the gate that was supposed to be locked after midnight, the gate whose keypad code was known only to custody wing officers -- and left onto Jalan Dang Wangi, where a silver Toyota Vios waited on the opposite kerb, engine running, headlights off, registration plates removed. The man opened the rear door. Climbed in. The car pulled away eastbound.

Timestamp: 04:32 AM. Vehicle description submitted to PDRM traffic division. The Vios would not appear on any camera after Jalan Dang Wangi. The Vios would vanish the way the man inside it would vanish -- professionally, completely.

But Ahmad had the footage. Ahmad had the timestamp. Ahmad had the open gate. And from Priya's letter and the station's own records, Ahmad had the name of the officer who had authorised the man's release at 04:30 AM: Inspector Kamal bin Yusof. The same inspector who filed the death report. The same inspector who classified Connor Briggs's death as suicide.

Ahmad placed the transaction record and the CCTV analysis in the folder on his desk. The folder was growing.

He was building a case against a superior officer in his own station. The case was being constructed in the same building where the crime had been committed, the evidence gathered from the same systems that the suspects had access to. The geometry was the geometry of a man defusing a device that he was standing on.

---

## III. The Pattern

The IC number was the key.

Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad. Identity Card 890412-14-5567. Ahmad entered the number into the PDRM criminal records database on a Monday morning, nine days after Connor's death, his office door closed, his screen angled away from the corridor window. The database returned a thin record -- deliberately thin, the kind maintained at minimum detail because maximum detail would have revealed what Ahmad was looking for.

Ahmad was not looking in the local records. Ahmad was looking across jurisdictions.

The PDRM's databases were siloed by district, each station's records existing in isolation, the information architecture designed for local case management rather than pattern detection across multiple stations. The pattern was there. The pattern had been there for years. The pattern had been invisible because the system was not designed to see its own patterns, the way a mirror was not designed to reflect itself.

Ahmad cross-referenced. He pulled detention records from four districts. The cross-referencing took three days -- three days of formal requests and inter-station protocols and the bureaucratic friction that the system generated when one station asked another station for records, the friction that was normally an inconvenience but that in this case was the barrier that had prevented the pattern from being detected, the administrative architecture that had allowed a man to move from cell to cell across the Klang Valley leaving bodies behind him without any single station connecting its death to the deaths in the other stations.

The cross-reference produced:

IC 890412-14-5567 -- the number registered to Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad -- appeared in the detention records of four other police stations. Each appearance followed the same structure: arrested on a minor charge, placed in a holding cell with a prisoner facing drug trafficking charges, the prisoner found dead within twelve hours, death classified as suicide, Rizal released the following morning.

Serdang. July 2023. Cellmate: Daniel Park, 24, Korean-American. 200g methamphetamine. Found dead at 03:40 AM. Ligature: belt. Should have been removed per SOP 14.2.3. Rizal released 05:15 AM.

Shah Alam. January 2024. Cellmate: Mikhail Sorokin, 29, Russian. 180g methamphetamine. Found dead at 02:55 AM. Ligature: drawstring from tracksuit trousers. Should have been removed. Rizal released 04:00 AM.

Petaling Jaya. June 2024. Cellmate: Abdul Rahim bin Yusof, 31, Malaysian. 75g methamphetamine. Found dead at 01:20 AM. Ligature: shoelaces. Should have been removed. Rizal released 03:45 AM.

Sentul. October 2025. Cellmate: Suresh Pillai, 35, Malaysian-Indian. 120g methamphetamine. Found dead at 04:10 AM. Ligature: towel. Rizal released 05:30 AM.

Dang Wangi. February 2026. Cellmate: Connor James Briggs, 27, Australian. 450g methamphetamine. Found dead at 02:17 AM. Ligature: microfiber travel towel. Rizal released 04:30 AM.

Five cells. Five cellmates. Five dead. Five suicides. Five ligatures that should have been removed. Five releases in the hours following the death.

Ahmad looked at the list. The list was not a list. The list was a production schedule. The list was the operational record of a man whose function in the network was the elimination of arrested mules, a function performed with the regularity of a maintenance task, the network activating the protocol when a mule was caught the way a company activated its insurance policy when an asset was compromised -- automatically, procedurally, without sentiment.

Five dead. Five human beings who had been converted to five rows in Ahmad's spreadsheet, five cases in the PDRM system, five entries that SUARAM had documented without connecting them, five families in five countries who had received phone calls in the night and been told the word *suicide*. The word had been accepted by the system because the system had accepted it, each station examining its own death in isolation, each death an anomaly within its own district, the anomalies never aggregated, the pattern never assembled, the five data points never plotted on the same graph.

Until now. Until a letter from London and a spreadsheet on a ThinkPad in Wangsa Maju and a narcotics sergeant who could not stop following patterns.

Ahmad called the Deputy Public Prosecutor's office. The call initiated the process by which evidence became authority -- the process of warrants and charges that would give a sergeant the power to arrest the people in his folder, regardless of their rank or their proximity to his own desk.

---

## IV. The Arrests

The warrants were executed on a Thursday morning.

February 27th. 06:00 AM. Thirteen days after Connor Briggs's death. Three warrants. Three simultaneous operations -- the simultaneity coordinated so that no arrest would alert the others, the timing the tactical requirement of an investigation that could not afford to lose a suspect to flight. Ahmad had requested operational support from the Federal Narcotics Division at Bukit Aman -- not Dang Wangi officers, not officers who owed their positions to Inspector Kamal or their loyalty to the institutional hierarchy that Kamal occupied. The request was the tactical decision that removed the operation from the jurisdiction of the compromised station and placed it in the hands of the institution that the station answered to.

The first arrest was at WEI'S MOBILE: REPAIRS & ACCESSORIES, Petaling Street.

The shutters were down. The shop had been closed since February 14th -- since the morning when Wei had arrived for work and found Petaling Street full of police cars and the hostel cordoned off and had understood, with the immediate calculation of a man who knew what the police cars meant, that the protocol had been activated and the aftermath was two doors away. Wei had not run. Running was the amateur's response. Wei had closed the shop and maintained his routine and waited, the stillness of a man who understood that disappearance attracted attention and that the system processed the visible and overlooked the still.

The Bukit Aman team breached the shutters at 06:02 AM. The sound was the investigation's first public act -- metal giving way, the screech of the roller mechanism, the percussion of entry on Petaling Street. The char kway teow vendor across the road was lighting his wok, the blue flame catching. He watched the way vendors watched everything on Petaling Street -- with the studied indifference of a man who had been selling noodles in the same spot for twenty years and who had learned that the business of the street and the business of the police were parallel tracks that never touched.

Wei was in the back room. The back room contained what Ahmad's surveillance had anticipated and what Priya's letter had described: a vacuum sealer, commercial grade; a digital scale accurate to 0.1 grams; rolls of cling film; empty phone charger boxes with their interior padding removed; and on the stainless steel table, three vacuum-sealed bags containing a white crystalline substance that would field-test positive for methamphetamine. Packaging materials. The infrastructure of a logistics operation.

Wei was arrested. Wei said nothing. Wei's silence was the silence of a professional calculating the cost of every word, the silence that would hold for approximately fourteen hours before the evidence from the back room and the bank records and the CCTV footage from Wei's own security camera -- the camera that had recorded every pickup and drop-off, every face that entered the room, including Felix Decker's -- before all of this was presented to Wei and his lawyer and the silence became more dangerous than speech and the calculation shifted from concealment to cooperation. That calculation, and its consequences, would unfold in the weeks to come, in the interview rooms at Sungai Buloh, where Wei would describe the supply chain and the protocol and the names of eight mules recruited from the Lantern Hostel.

But that was later. On the morning of February 27th, Wei was cuffed and placed in a car, and the shop was sealed with yellow crime-scene tape -- bright against the old shophouse facade, the present's assertion over the past's architecture, the visual declaration that this building was no longer a phone repair shop but a point on the map that Ahmad was drawing.

The second arrest was in Kepong.

Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor lived in a flat on the seventh floor of a housing development twelve kilometres north of the city centre -- the standard configuration of a government-subsidised unit, the kind of flat that a police constable on RM2,800 per month could afford. The banking records told the rest of the story: not just the RM5,000 deposit on February 13th, but a pattern -- RM4,000 on October 10, 2025, the date that Suresh Pillai was found dead in his cell at Sentul. The dates of deposits corresponded to the dates of deaths. The correlation was the evidence. The evidence was in the folder. The folder was in Ahmad's hand when the team knocked on Hafiz's door at 06:08 AM.

Hafiz answered in a sarong and a T-shirt. His two-year-old daughter was on his hip. Behind him, his wife was preparing the morning's rice, the domestic smell that would become, in Hafiz's memory, the smell of the last normal moment.

"Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor, you are under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code, and for abuse of power under Section 23 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009."

Hafiz did not speak. His face performed the operation that Ahmad had seen on the faces of arrested officers -- the rapid recalculation of identity, the collapse of the self-image that said *I am the law* and the emergence of the new image that said *I am subject to the law*, the transformation that occurred in the eyes, the eyes of a constable becoming the eyes of a suspect in the duration of a sentence.

The wife appeared in the hallway. She held a cooking spoon. The spoon dripped water onto the floor. Her face was the face of a woman who understood -- not the details, not the deposits and the bathroom breaks and the towels, but the shape. She had known the shape of what was happening because she had known that the money was wrong, that the amounts were wrong, that the explanations were wrong, and she had not asked because not-asking was the condition of the arrangement, the silence that was the premium paid for the surplus.

Hafiz handed the daughter to his wife. He held out his wrists.

In approximately four hours, in an interview room at Bukit Aman -- not Dang Wangi, the investigation had moved beyond Dang Wangi -- Hafiz would break his silence. He would describe the phone call that offered the money. The voice on the phone had mentioned his daughter's name -- Aisyah, seven months old -- and the mention was not a threat but was understood as a threat, the way a gun displayed on a table was not a threat but was understood as a threat. Fear, not greed. The distinction mattered legally. The distinction did not matter to Connor Briggs.

The third action was not an arrest. It was a suspension.

Inspector Kamal bin Yusof was summoned to the Deputy Commissioner's office at Bukit Aman at 09:00 AM, three hours after the arrests. A staff officer delivered a sealed envelope to Kamal's office on the third floor of Dang Wangi -- one floor above Ahmad's -- containing his immediate suspension from duty pending investigation into his conduct in the matter of Report Number DW/KL/2026/0847-M.

Kamal read the letter. Kamal placed it on his desk. Kamal removed his badge and his service weapon and the authority that the badge and the weapon represented and placed them on the desk beside the letter. Kamal stood and walked out of his office and down the corridor and past Ahmad's office -- Ahmad was there, the door open -- and the two men's eyes met. The meeting of the eyes was the meeting of two men who had worked in the same building for four years and whose relationship had just been redefined from colleagues to investigator and suspect, the redefinition occurring in the space of a glance that held everything the investigation contained.

Kamal walked out of Dang Wangi. Kamal was not arrested because the evidence against him was still being assembled -- Hafiz's testimony, the banking records, the cell assignment authorisations, the release documentation for Rizal. Kamal was free. Kamal was the kind of free that was not free -- the freedom of a man whose phone was now monitored, whose bank accounts were now frozen, whose movements were tracked by the same system he had once commanded.

The international warrants were filed the same day. Felix Decker: INTERPOL Red Notice, transmitted through the Malaysian National Central Bureau to 195 member countries. Last known location Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Immigration records confirmed Felix had cleared departure at KLIA at 03:47 AM on February 14th -- twenty minutes before his flight, ninety minutes before the body was officially discovered, the timing not coincidence but choreography, the scheduling of the murder and the scheduling of the flight coordinated with the precision that was Felix's signature, the logistics of disappearance planned alongside the logistics of death.

Rizal's warrant was issued to a fiction. Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad, IC 890412-14-5567, was a constructed identity -- a name attached to a body, the identity a tool used and discardable. The warrant was for the body. The body was somewhere in Southeast Asia, absorbed into the infrastructure that had deployed it, the network consuming its own operative the way it consumed its mules, the difference being that mules were consumed as liabilities and operatives were consumed as assets to be preserved, relocated, redeployed.

Ahmad issued the warrants knowing they would not immediately produce their targets. He issued them because the warrants were the system's declaration that these men were no longer free, the documents that converted the state's attention from passive to active, from surveillance to pursuit.

## V. The Photographs

On the morning of the arrests, Tomoko Sato sent her photographs to two recipients: Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail at Dang Wangi, and Lim Wei Ling at The Star.

Fifty-nine photographs, backed up to a cloud server in Tokyo before Felix's associates stole her camera. Felix and Connor on the rooftop. Connor carrying packages on Petaling Street. Felix at Wei's shop window. Connor at the Jalan Ipoh drop. The chronological record of a recruitment, captured by a woman who had recognised the predator's pattern from Day 3 and had documented it with the professional discipline of a photojournalist and the professional detachment that she would later identify as her greatest failure.

For Ahmad, the photographs were corroboration. For The Star, they were a story.

---

## VI. The Front Page

The Star published the photographs on Tuesday, March 3rd. Page one. Above the fold.

**MURDER IN CUSTODY: PHOTOGRAPHS REVEAL DRUG NETWORK THAT KILLED AUSTRALIAN BACKPACKER**

Four thousand words spanning pages one, four, and five. The photographs reproduced across page four. The names that had been in Ahmad's folder now in the information stream that three hundred thousand households received. The article named Felix Decker, the Lantern Hostel, Wei's phone repair shop. It described the network's method. It cited SUARAM. It quoted the Australian High Commission. It did not name Priya. It could not quote Ahmad.

The original one hundred and forty-seven words had become fourteen thousand. The word *suicide* was being replaced by the word *murder*, and the replacement was migrating through the system, slow but irreversible.

---

## VII. The Desk

Ahmad sat at his desk at Dang Wangi on the evening of March 3rd. The article would not compromise the case -- the photographs were evidence independently submitted to both the police and the newspaper. Ahmad had not leaked. Ahmad had not briefed. Ahmad had done what Ahmad always did: built the case, executed the warrants, filed the charges, and let the evidence speak through the channels that the evidence found.

He opened the laptop. The spreadsheet. Six rows. Six names. Six deaths.

BRIGGS, Connor James.

The file was open. The arrests were made. The warrants were issued. The front page had been printed. The machinery of accountability was turning, and the turning, however slow, was the thing that distinguished this death from the five that preceded it.

Ahmad closed the laptop. He walked down the corridor, past the night crew, past the door to the custody wing where Cell C-7's fluorescent light was on. The light was always on. He walked out of Dang Wangi into the warm KL night.

And somewhere, in a city that Ahmad could not reach, in a hostel that Ahmad did not know the name of, a man with a German accent and a thin scar on his left eyebrow was sitting in a common room, drinking a beer, smiling at a stranger who was broke and lonely and far from home. The stranger was young. The stranger was exactly the kind of person the man looked for.

The pattern continued. The investigation continued. The two ran in parallel, locked together in the oldest geometry of all.

*End of Chapter 43*
# Chapter 44: Priya Returns

The air at KLIA2 was the same air.

Priya walked through the budget terminal -- the AirAsia terminal, the terminal where Connor had arrived twelve weeks ago on a cheap flight from Bali, his phone at three percent, his plan nonexistent, his fatal confidence intact. She walked past the sign above customs. DADAH MEMBAWA MAUT -- DRUGS BRING DEATH. Red letters the height of a child. She read it. She had always read it. Connor had walked past it without reading. The not-reading was the first act of a chain that ended in a cell at Dang Wangi.

She had not come for the body -- the Australian High Commission was handling the repatriation, the bureaucratic process of transporting human remains across international borders. She had come to bring the truth home. The truth that the police report had not told. The truth that the word "suicide" had concealed.

She collected her bag, passed through customs in twelve seconds, and stepped outside into the heat of KL in late March -- thirty-two degrees, ninety percent humidity, the air pressing against her skin. She stood on the kerb and thought: *This is the last air he breathed before the cell. This heat. This country. This.*

She took a Grab to KL Sentral, then the LRT to Pasar Seni, then walked the ten minutes to Petaling Street. The walk took her past the Guan Di Temple, past the market stalls, and past Wei's phone repair shop -- sealed now with police tape and a new padlock, the shop where the packages had been assembled and the network had operated in plain sight, two doors from a hostel full of backpackers who noticed nothing.

She turned and walked to the hostel.

---

The Lantern Hostel stood where it had always stood, at the narrow end of a lane off Petaling Street, between the phone repair shop and the traditional Chinese medicine store. The facade was the same -- the pre-war plasterwork, chipped and faded, the ornate mouldings above the windows, the narrow door, and above the door the red lantern that gave the place its name. The lantern was lit. The lantern was always lit. The lantern was the first thing a guest saw and the last thing a guest remembered and the light it cast was warm and red and the warmth and redness were the hostel's invitation, the building's way of saying *come in, come in, there is shelter here, there is company, there is a bed and a meal and the temporary community of strangers*.

She entered. The bell above the door rang -- the same sound for every arrival and every departure, the bell not distinguishing between the living and the dead.

Mei Ling was at reception. Mei Ling looked up. Her expression when she saw Priya was not surprise -- Mei Ling's expression was rarely surprise, because Mei Ling had seen too many things at this reception desk to be surprised by any of them. The expression was something else. Recognition. Acknowledgment. The look of a person who had been expecting something without knowing when it would arrive.

"Priya."

"Hi, Mei Ling."

The two words were the same two words that Connor had said to Priya on the morning she left. *Hi.* The word that carried everything it couldn't say. The word that was a placeholder for the language that grief had erased.

"You came back," Mei Ling said.

"I came back."

Mei Ling reached under the counter and produced a key. Not a dorm assignment -- a private room key. Private Room 2, the room that was usually storage, sometimes rented. The room on the third floor, across the hall from Felix's former room, Felix's room that was now empty, Felix's room that had been searched by Ahmad's team and stripped of its contents and left as a hollow space that contained nothing but the memory of the man who had occupied it.

"Razak said to give you this. No charge."

Priya took the key. Brass, old, the kind of key the building had used since 1928. She held it and the holding was the first physical connection to the building that had been the setting of the worst thing that had ever happened to her.

"I need to go to Dorm 3," she said.

Mei Ling didn't ask why. Mei Ling knew why. Mei Ling nodded and Priya walked past the reception desk and through the common room -- the common room where she had sat with Connor on the sofa, where she had met him, where she had argued with him, where she had kissed him, where she had told him about the letter, where she had said goodbye -- and up the narrow staircase, the staircase where the third step from the top still squeaked, and onto the second floor, and down the corridor, past Dorm 1 and Dorm 2, to the door of Dorm 3.

She opened the door.

The dorm was the same. Eight bunks, four on each side, the wooden frames dark with age and the accumulated oils of a thousand bodies. The ceiling fan turned. The air well let in the grey light of an overcast afternoon, the light filtered through the laundry that hung on the lines above the courtyard -- a German flag beach towel, a pair of cargo shorts, a sports bra, the textile archaeology of a hostel's current population. The room smelled of damp wood and Tiger Balm and the faint, sweet rot that all old buildings in the tropics carried, the smell of timber slowly returning to the earth.

Bed 7 was on the right side, second from the back, lower bunk.

A person was sleeping in it.

The person was young -- early twenties, female, dark hair spread on the pillow, the sheet pulled to her chin. A French passport was visible in the mesh pocket of the bed frame. A copy of Camus's *L'Etranger* lay face-down on the mattress beside her, the irony of the title -- *The Stranger*, *The Outsider* -- so precise that Priya almost laughed, almost produced the sound that existed between laughter and the other thing, the sound that the absurd generated when it was too accurate to be coincidence and too cruel to be comedy.

The girl was sleeping in Connor's bed. The bed where he had lain awake at three in the morning, his hand brushing the carved letters he never read. Another body in the same space, the replacement without ceremony, the way the sea closed over a swimmer.

Priya stood in the doorway and looked at Bed 7 and the looking was the goodbye.

The goodbye she had not had. The system had taken that too -- along with his body, his belongings, his bed assignment. Processed him out. She stood in the doorway the way she had stood at bedsides during her hospital placements, beside patients who were already gone, the body present, the person absent, the gap between the two the thing that medicine could measure but not close.

She stood for three minutes. She did not enter the room. She did not touch the bed. She did not wake the girl. She stood and looked and the looking was enough, was all she could have, was the closest she would get to the physical space where Connor had been alive, the space that had held his body and now held another body and would hold another after that and another after that, the space that was the same space and was different space because the person who had made it his was gone and the gone was permanent.

She turned and walked back down the corridor. The third step from the top squeaked. The squeak was the same squeak. Everything was the same and nothing was the same and the sameness was the cruelty.

---

Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters was a building that looked like what it was.

The building was concrete and functional, the architecture of authority -- square, solid, designed not to invite but to contain, not to welcome but to process. The Malaysian flag flew from the pole above the entrance. The PDRM crest was mounted on the wall. The air conditioning hit Priya as she entered and the cold was the cold of institutions, the artificial climate that government buildings maintained as proof of their separation from the street, the temperature saying *this is not outside, this is inside, and inside the rules are different*.

She had called Ahmad from London. She had called him on the number he had given Razak, the number that was now in her phone under the name SGT AHMAD -- DANG WANGI. She had told him she was coming back. He had said: "You don't have to." She had said: "I know." The exchange was the exchange of two people who understood that obligation was not the same as compulsion, that the drive to return was not duty but something else, something that lived in the space between duty and love and guilt and the need to see, to physically see, the place where the person you loved had died.

Ahmad met her in the lobby. He was shorter than she expected -- shorter than his voice, which was deep and measured and carried the authority of a man who had spent twenty years in the police force and had learned that authority was not volume but precision. He wore the uniform of the PDRM -- the khaki shirt, the dark trousers, the insignia of a sergeant in the Narcotics Division. His face was the face of a man in his forties who had seen things that had aged him, the lines around his eyes deeper than they should have been, the grey at his temples more than genetics alone could account for.

"Miss Sharma."

"Sergeant Ahmad."

They shook hands. The handshake was formal, correct, the handshake of two people meeting in a professional context who were connected by a tragedy that made professionalism both necessary and insufficient. His hand was dry and firm. Hers was damp from the walk from the LRT station.

"Thank you for your letter," he said. "And for coming back. You didn't have to come back."

"I had to come back."

He nodded. The nod carried something that the professional handshake had not -- the weight of a man who had read the same report that Priya had read and who did not believe it either.

He led her to his office. The office was on the second floor -- a room with a desk, two chairs, a filing cabinet, a window that looked onto a car park. The desk was covered in folders. The folders were the case -- the case that had started with Priya's letter and Tomoko's photographs and Razak's cooperation and had grown, in the weeks since, into the bureaucratic mass of a murder investigation, the mass that consisted of statements and forensic reports and phone records and bank records and CCTV footage and the accumulated evidence of a system responding to its own failure.

"I can show you some of the file," Ahmad said. "Not all. There are things that are sub judice -- the prosecution is building its case. But the parts that involve your statement, your evidence, the context."

He opened a folder. He turned it toward her. She read.

She read the arrest report. The report described Connor's arrest at a police checkpoint between Tapah and Ipoh on the North-South Expressway. The report described the drug dog's alert. The report described the opening of the suitcase, the discovery of five vacuum-sealed bags containing 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in the suitcase lining. The report described Connor's response: *Subject became distressed. Subject stated: "I didn't know. Mate, I swear, I didn't know." Subject was advised of his rights under Malaysian law.*

She read the processing record. The record described Connor's arrival at Dang Wangi. The record listed his belongings: one mobile phone (Samsung, cracked screen), one wallet (containing RM340, one Australian driver's licence, one debit card), one pair of Birkenstock sandals, one braided leather bracelet, one blue Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel.

She stopped at the towel. The towel was listed between the bracelet and the entry that said *End of personal effects*. The towel was an item on a list. The towel was a thing that had been catalogued and recorded and placed in a plastic bag and the placement was the last bureaucratic act performed on a possession that had been Connor's most constant companion, the towel that had been to twelve countries and dried his body on beaches and been wrapped around his shoulders in the cell and been the instrument of his death.

The towel was listed. The towel was in evidence. The towel was not in the cell.

"Can I see the cell?" she asked.

Ahmad paused. The pause was the pause of a man weighing a request against protocol, protocol against compassion, the rules of an active investigation against the needs of a woman who had loved the victim.

"It's not standard procedure."

"I know."

He stood. She stood. He led her out of the office and down a staircase -- not the main staircase but a side staircase, the staircase that connected the administrative floors to the custody level, the staircase that descended from the world of desks and files and the bureaucratic management of crime to the world of cells and bars and the physical containment of the accused. The staircase was narrow. The walls were painted the same institutional grey as everything else in the building. The fluorescent lights buzzed.

The custody corridor was at the bottom. The corridor was long, narrow, concrete floor, cells on both sides. The cells were identical -- three metres by three metres, concrete walls painted grey, a steel bench bolted to the wall, bars on the front painted institutional green, a squat toilet in the corner. Each cell had a number painted on the wall above the door.

They walked to the end of the corridor. Cell C-7.

Ahmad stopped. He did not enter. He stood to the side and let Priya stand at the bars and look in.

The cell was empty. The cell was clean -- the industrial clean of a space that had been processed by a forensic team and then cleaned by a janitorial crew, the double erasure of evidence and trace, the professional removal of everything that had happened followed by the chemical removal of everything that remained. The concrete floor was spotless. The steel bench was bare. The squat toilet was dry.

The fluorescent light was on. The light was always on -- on when Connor was alive in this cell, on when he was dying, on when he was dead, on now. The light was indifferent to the states of the bodies it illuminated.

Priya looked at the cell. She looked at the bench where Connor had lain. She looked at the bars from which his body had been hung. She looked at the ceiling, at the fluorescent tube, at the buzzing white light that had been the last thing Connor saw, the light that had narrowed to a point and then to nothing.

She looked for the towel. The towel was not there. The towel was in evidence, in a plastic bag, in a locker, in a room in this building, catalogued and tagged and preserved as Exhibit 14 in the murder investigation that the towel had made necessary. The towel's absence was the loudest thing in the cell. The absence was louder than the fluorescent buzz, louder than the silence, louder than the institutional hum of the building's ventilation system. The absence said: *something was here that is no longer here, and the no-longer-here is the evidence that something happened, and the something that happened is the reason you are standing at these bars*.

"How long did it take?" she asked.

Ahmad was quiet for a moment. The moment was the moment of a man deciding how much truth to share, how much clinical detail a grieving woman could hold, how much of the forensic reality was necessary for the understanding she sought.

"The pathologist estimated three to four minutes of sustained compression. Loss of consciousness within twenty to thirty seconds. Brain death within four to six minutes."

"Was he awake? Did he know?"

"The evidence suggests he was conscious when the attack began. There were defensive marks on his hands. Abrasions on his fingernails consistent with attempting to grip a smooth surface. He fought."

"He fought."

The words were not a question. The words were a statement, a fact, a piece of information that Priya received and stored in the place where she stored the things about Connor that mattered -- the real things, the things that the Instagram persona and the breezy confidence and the "she'll be right" had concealed. Connor had fought. Connor, who had never fought for anything, who had drifted through life on the current of his own ease, who had taken the path of least resistance at every turning -- Connor had fought. In the cell, at the end, when the towel was around his neck and the light was narrowing, he had fought.

It wasn't enough. It was never going to be enough. But he had fought.

"Thank you," she said.

*Bas*, she thought. *Enough.* The Gujarati arriving uninvited, the way it did when she was small and frightened, the language her mother used to end things.

She stepped back from the bars. She did not touch them. The not-touching was deliberate -- the bars were the boundary between the world she occupied and the world where Connor had died, and the boundary was a kind of membrane, and crossing it, even with a hand, felt like a transgression, like entering a space that belonged to the dead and the dead alone.

They walked back up the staircase. The fluorescent lights buzzed. The institutional grey surrounded them. The building processed their passage the way it processed everything -- silently, efficiently, without acknowledgment.

---

Tomoko was in the common room when Priya returned to the hostel.

She was sitting at the table by the window, her replacement Canon beside her, and spread on the table, printed on A4 paper in rows of six, were photographs. Fifty-nine photographs.

They had not seen each other since the day Priya left. Tomoko stood and crossed the room and put her arms around Priya -- brief, firm, the embrace of a person who did not embrace easily but who understood that certain moments required it.

They sat. The photographs were between them.

"I backed them up before the camera was stolen," Tomoko said. "Cloud server in Tokyo. Ahmad has everything. But these are the ones The Star is publishing."

The photographs were organised chronologically. Felix in the common room, Day 3. Felix and Connor on the rooftop, Day 4, Felix's hand on Connor's shoulder -- the hand of a handler establishing contact with a recruit. Felix at Wei's phone repair shop, Day 9. Connor on Petaling Street with a package under his arm, Day 10. Connor at a shophouse in Jalan Ipoh, Day 16, handing a package to a woman Ahmad had since identified and arrested.

"You had all this," Priya said.

"I had it from Day 9. I had enough to go to the police and I didn't go."

"Why?"

"I was building a story," Tomoko said. "I'm a photojournalist. When I started seeing Felix's operation, I thought: this is the story. The photographs, the evidence, the narrative arc. I was thinking in frames and deadlines, in column inches and publication dates."

She paused.

"I was building a story when I should have been making a phone call. One phone call. That's all it would have taken. Instead, I took photographs. I documented. I watched a man walk into a trap and photographed the walking and told myself the documentation was a form of action. The documentation was not action. It was the thing I did instead of action. And it cost a man his life."

The ceiling fans turned. Through the kitchen doorway, Mama Siti was visible at her station, the rhythm of her hands constant.

"The photographs are being published," Priya said.

"The Star. Tomorrow. Front page."

"We both failed him," Priya said.

"Yes."

"I left. You watched."

"Yes."

"And he's dead."

"Yes."

The third *yes* settled between them on the table, among the photographs, and the settling was not absolution but was, perhaps, the beginning of the thing that preceded absolution.

---

The Australian High Commission was on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng, in the diplomatic quarter. Priya arrived at ten the following morning. Sarah Chen -- the consular officer who had called Connor's parents at 3 AM, the voice that had crossed twelve thousand kilometres of telephone line to change the shape of two lives -- met her in the waiting area.

They sat in a small meeting room.

"I want to be clear about what the High Commission can and can't do," Sarah Chen said. "We've requested a full post-mortem, which has been conducted. We've lodged a formal request for a coroner's inquest."

"The police report said suicide."

"The murder investigation says otherwise. The inquest is the legal mechanism for resolving that conflict. But the process can take months."

"His parents are coming."

"Tomorrow. I'll be accompanying them to the morgue for the formal identification."

Priya looked at Sarah Chen -- the system's human face, steady-eyed, hands folded on the table, professional and person simultaneously.

"I want to tell you something," Priya said. "Not as a witness. Just as a person."

"Of course."

"He was arrogant and careless and ignorant and he dismissed every warning and he trusted the wrong person and he did everything wrong. Everything." She paused. "And he was kind. He bought me a jade bracelet at the night market because I looked at it for three seconds. He sat with Mama Siti in the kitchen and tried to learn how to make sambal and burned his hand and laughed. He called his mother on Sundays. He was a person. Not a headline. Not a case file. Not a mule. A person."

The jade bracelet was on Priya's wrist. Sarah Chen looked at it. She looked at Priya. She nodded.

"We're pressing for a full inquest," she said. "And we'll keep pressing."

Priya took a taxi back to Petaling Street. She entered the hostel. The bell rang. She climbed the staircase. She sat on the bed in Private Room 2 and held the jade bracelet and the holding was the holding of the last physical evidence that a man had loved her in this building, in this country where the penalty for ignorance was death and the payment was final and the receipt was a bracelet made of jade.

Tomorrow, the parents would come.
# Chapter 45: The Parents

They had never been to Asia.

David and Karen Briggs had been to Europe -- Italy, twice, for the food and the art, the trips that Australians of their generation and class took because Europe was the place you went when you could afford to go somewhere. They had been to New Zealand, which barely counted as abroad because New Zealand was the close neighbour, the cousin, the country that was different enough to be interesting and similar enough to be safe. They had been to Fiji, once, for their twenty-fifth anniversary, the resort holiday where the pool was never more than thirty metres from the room and the food was Western and the danger was sunburn.

They had never been to Asia. Asia was where Connor went. Asia was the place their son had gone four years ago and not come back from, the place that existed in his Instagram posts and his occasional phone calls and the monthly withdrawal of $2,000 from their account, the place that was simultaneously their son's home and a abstraction, a concept rather than a reality, a word rather than a world.

Now they were in it.

KLIA2 arrived around them the way airports arrived around everyone -- suddenly, totally, the transition from the sealed container of the aircraft to the open space of the terminal, the transition from the controlled atmosphere of recycled air and seat-back screens and the muted conformity of long-haul travel to the located, irreducible reality of a place. The place was Malaysia. The place was the last place their son had been alive. The place was the place where their son had died.

The terminal was large, modern, crowded. The signs were in Bahasa Melayu and English and Mandarin and Tamil, the four-language system of a country built on the confluence of civilisations. The announcements came in two languages -- Malay first, then English, the priority reflecting the constitutional hierarchy. The faces in the crowd were Malay and Chinese and Indian and European and the diversity was the diversity of a country that sat at the crossroads of trade routes and had accumulated, over centuries, the human cargo of commerce and colonialism and the modern traffic of tourism.

David carried a small backpack. The backpack was navy blue, practical, the kind of bag a property developer from Hawthorn carried when he didn't want to check luggage. The bag contained three shirts, two pairs of trousers, a toiletry bag, his passport, and a folder of documents -- the police report, the consular correspondence, the printed emails from Sarah Chen, the contact information for the lawyer they had retained in KL, the paperwork that grief had generated, the bureaucratic output of a death that had occurred in a foreign jurisdiction and required the administrative apparatus of two countries to resolve.

Karen carried a photograph.

The photograph was not in a frame. The photograph was a print -- a 6x4, glossy, the standard format of photographs from the era before phones replaced cameras. The photograph was of Connor at seventeen, in his school uniform, the Scotch College blazer and tie, standing in the front garden of the Hawthorn house with the jacaranda tree behind him. His hair was shorter than it would become, his face rounder, his expression the expression of a boy who was not yet the man who would travel to twelve countries and carry drugs in a hostel in KL and die with a towel around his neck in a cell at Dang Wangi. In the photograph, he was a boy. He was their boy.

Karen held the photograph the way she had held it for the entire flight -- in her right hand, face up, the image visible. She had not put it in her bag. She had not slipped it into the seat pocket. She had held it from Melbourne to KL, eleven hours, the photograph her companion and her evidence and her proof that the person they were flying to identify had once been a boy in a blazer in a garden and the jacaranda was blooming and the light was the golden light of a Melbourne autumn afternoon.

The flight had been AirAsia -- the budget airline, the same airline Connor had flown. They had not planned this. The flights available on short notice were limited, and the AirAsia flight was the soonest departure, and the soonest departure was the only criterion that mattered because Karen had said *today* to Sarah Chen on the phone and *today* had meant *today*, the urgency not of logistics but of biology, the maternal imperative to be near the child, to close the distance between the living mother and the dead son, the distance that was twelve thousand kilometres and was also infinite.

They passed through immigration. The officer stamped their passports. The stamps were the stamps that Malaysia issued to arriving visitors -- the red ink, the date, the permitted duration of stay. The stamps were the same stamps that Connor's passport had received forty-eight days ago. Connor's passport was now in evidence, in a plastic bag, in a locker at Dang Wangi, tagged as property of the deceased. The passport would be returned to them. The passport would travel back to Melbourne in their luggage, the document that had enabled the journey that ended the life, the administrative key that had opened the door to the country that contained the cell that contained the death.

They emerged into the arrivals hall. The heat was there, waiting, the heat that was not like Melbourne's heat -- Melbourne's heat was dry, seasonal, the heat of a temperate city that experienced summer as a visitor. KL's heat was permanent, structural, the heat of a city that existed at three degrees above the equator and did not experience seasons but only rain and the absence of rain, the heat that was not weather but climate, not a condition but an identity.

David felt the heat and the heat entered his body and he thought: *This is what he felt. When he walked out of this building forty-eight days ago, this is the air that met him. This is the heat that pressed against his skin. This is the first thing Malaysia gave him.*

Karen felt the heat and did not think about the heat. Karen was looking at the crowd beyond the barrier -- the drivers with name signs, the families waiting, the greeters and the meeters, the human infrastructure of arrival. She was looking for Sarah Chen. Sarah Chen had said she would meet them. Sarah Chen's face was not known to Karen -- they had only spoken on the phone, three times, the first time at 3 AM in the hallway, the second time the following morning when the emergency generator had been replaced by the deeper, more durable engine of purpose, the third time to confirm the flight details. Sarah Chen was a voice. Sarah Chen was about to become a face.

A woman stepped forward from the crowd. She was in her thirties, professional, the grey blazer and white blouse of a consular officer at work. She held a small sign: BRIGGS.

"Mr. and Mrs. Briggs. I'm Sarah Chen. We spoke on the phone."

The voice was the voice. The voice that had entered the Hawthorn house at 3 AM and changed the shape of the world. The voice was now attached to a person, a face, a body, a woman standing in an arrivals hall holding a sign with their name on it, the name that was also their son's name, the name that had been in newspapers and police reports and consular correspondence and would be in more newspapers soon.

David shook her hand. Karen did not -- Karen's right hand held the photograph and Karen's left hand held David's arm and the holding of both was the holding of the two things she could not let go: the image of her son and the body of her husband, the evidence of the past and the anchor of the present.

"Thank you for coming," Sarah Chen said. "I know this is --"

"Where is he?" Karen said.

The question was direct, unmodified, the question of a mother who had travelled twelve thousand kilometres and eleven hours and had not slept and had not eaten and had held a photograph for the duration and wanted only the answer to the question that had been forming since the phone rang at 3 AM: *where is my son?*

"The hospital. The forensic mortuary at Hospital Kuala Lumpur. I'll take you there now, if you're ready."

"We're ready," David said. He said it because Karen was already moving, already walking toward the exit, already crossing the arrivals hall with the purpose of a woman for whom ready was not a state to be achieved but a condition that had existed since the moment she learned her son was dead, the readiness to see him, to be near him, to touch him one more time, the readiness that was not courage but compulsion, the need that was stronger than fear and older than reason.

---

Hospital Kuala Lumpur was a complex of buildings on Jalan Pahang, the public hospital, the government hospital, the hospital where the people of KL were born and treated and died. The forensic mortuary was in a separate wing, a low building at the edge of the complex, the architecture functional, the purpose singular.

Sarah Chen drove them. The car was the High Commission vehicle -- a Toyota sedan, air-conditioned, clean. The drive from KLIA2 took an hour. During the hour, Sarah Chen explained the process. The explanation was delivered in the measured, rehearsed language of a person who had done this before -- not with the Briggs specifically but with other families, other parents, other people who had flown to Malaysia to identify the body of someone they loved.

"The identification is a formal process," she said. "You'll be taken to a viewing room. The body will be on a table, covered by a sheet. The attendant will fold the sheet back from the face. You'll be asked to confirm the identity. You can take as long as you need."

David nodded. He was in the front passenger seat. He watched the city through the windscreen -- the highway, the buildings, the traffic, the palm trees, the construction cranes, the billboards in three languages. The city was modern and sprawling and unfamiliar and every part of it was the last place his son had been and every building might have been a building Connor had walked past and every street might have been a street Connor had walked on and the *might have been* was the particular torment of a parent in a dead child's city, the inability to know which surfaces had held the child's footprints, which air had held the child's breath, which lights had been the last lights the child had seen.

Karen was in the back seat. She held the photograph. She had not spoken since the question in the arrivals hall. The not-speaking was not silence -- the not-speaking was the concentration of a mind engaged in a single task, the task of getting to the place where her son was, the task that required the conservation of every resource, every word, every breath, for the moment when she would see him.

The mortuary entrance was a door. Not a grand entrance, not an architectural statement, but a door -- grey, metal, institutional, the door that separated the living from the dead and the dead from the living, the door that families walked through once and carried the walking through for the rest of their lives.

A mortuary attendant met them. He was a Malay man in his fifties, quiet, experienced, gentle in the way that mortuary workers became gentle over years of dealing with grief in its most concentrated form. He spoke to Sarah Chen in Bahasa Melayu. Sarah Chen translated.

"He'll take you to the viewing room. He asks if you need a moment."

"No," Karen said. The word was the same word she had said on the phone: *today*. The word was the word of a woman who understood that moments of preparation were moments of delay and delay was the thing she could not tolerate, the thing that stood between her and her son.

The corridor was long. The floor was linoleum. The walls were pale green. The lighting was fluorescent -- the same fluorescent that lit every institutional space in this country, the same fluorescent that had lit the cell where Connor died, the universal light of systems that processed humans without regard for the humans' preference for warmth.

The viewing room was at the end of the corridor. The room was small. The room contained a table, a steel table, the kind of table that existed only in places where bodies were placed on tables -- hospitals, morgues, the rooms where the living came to see the dead. The table was covered by a white sheet. Under the white sheet was a shape.

The shape was a body. The body was their son.

Karen entered the room first. David followed. Sarah Chen waited at the door. The attendant stood by the table.

The attendant looked at Karen. Karen nodded.

The attendant folded the sheet back from the face.

The face was Connor's face.

The face was Connor's face and was not Connor's face. The face she had known for twenty-seven years -- the delivery room at the Royal Women's Hospital, the face red and creased and crying and the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. The face that had grown and changed and become a boy and a teenager and a man, and was now in repose, but the repose was not sleep, was the permanent stillness that death imposed on the muscles that had animated the face and made it Connor's rather than a face.

The tan was fading. Four years of equatorial sun retreating, the skin returning to the colour he had been born with, the colour of a baby in Parkville, the first colour, underneath the years.

His hair was the same. Dirty blonde, sun-bleached. The hair she had washed when he was a child.

Karen touched his hair.

Her hand moved from her side to his head and the movement was the movement of twenty-seven years of touching, the hand that had smoothed this hair when it was wet from the bath and when it was tangled after sleep and when it was sweaty after sport and when it was hidden under a hat. The hand knew this hair. The hand recognised this hair the way it recognised nothing else in the room -- not the table, not the walls, not the sheet, not the country -- the hand found the hair and the finding was the last recognition, the last physical confirmation that the body on the table was the body she had made, the body she had grown inside her and delivered and held and bathed and clothed and fed and loved and watched walk through a departure gate four years ago and not come back.

David's hand was on her shoulder.

The hand was on her shoulder the way it had been on Connor's shoulder at the airport, four years ago, the day Connor had left. The same position. The same weight. The same five fingers resting on the same place -- the bone, the muscle, the fabric of a shirt. At the airport, the hand on Connor's shoulder had been the hand of a father saying goodbye to a son. Now, the hand on Karen's shoulder was the hand of a husband holding a wife while she touched their dead son's hair. The hand was the same hand. The position was the same position. The weight was the same weight. But the meaning had changed because the person under the hand had changed and the person on the table had changed everything, the death changing not just the dead but the living, not just the body but the bodies around it, the death radiating outward from the table through the room through the building through the city through the sky to a house in Hawthorn where a photograph sat on a table in a hallway and the photograph was all that remained of the original configuration, the configuration of a family with two children both alive.

Karen's hand stayed on Connor's hair. David's hand stayed on Karen's shoulder. The three of them -- the living couple and the dead son -- held the position in the viewing room of the forensic mortuary at Hospital Kuala Lumpur and the holding was the last time the three of them would be together, the last time the family would occupy the same space, the geometry of three bodies in a room and one of the bodies was still and the stillness was the condition that made this the last time and the last time was a thing that could not be known as the last time until it was over and then it was always the last time, retroactively, permanently.

"That's Connor," David said.

The words were the formal identification. The words were required by the process -- a family member confirming the identity of the deceased, the legal act that converted a body from anonymous remains to a named person with a citizenship and a family and a history and a file. The words were procedural. The words were also the last time David would say his son's name and have his son be present to hear it, even though the hearing was impossible, even though the dead did not hear, even though the words travelled from David's mouth to the air and the air held them and the air was the air of a room where hearing had ended.

"That's our boy," Karen said.

The attendant waited. Sarah Chen waited. The room waited. The building waited. The city outside the building waited, the traffic and the heat and the eight million lives continuing while in this room, in this building, in this city, two parents from Melbourne stood over the body of their twenty-seven-year-old son and the standing was the thing they had flown twelve thousand kilometres to do and the thing they would never be ready for and the thing that was happening now, in this moment, in this room, under this light.

---

The hostel was a ten-minute walk from the LRT station. Sarah Chen offered to drive them but Karen said no. Karen wanted to walk. Karen wanted to walk through the streets that Connor had walked through, to feel the pavement under her feet that had been under his feet, to breathe the air that had been his air. The walking was not sightseeing. The walking was pilgrimage, the movement of a body through a landscape that was sacred not because of what it contained but because of who had moved through it before.

They walked down Petaling Street. The market was active -- the stalls, the vendors, the shoppers, the permanent commerce of a street that had been trading since the tin-mining days of the nineteenth century. The noise was the noise that Connor had loved, the chaos that he had filmed and posted and captioned with hashtags. The smells were the smells he had smelled -- the char kway teow frying, the diesel exhaust, the incense from the Guan Di Temple. The colours were the colours he had seen -- the red of Chinese signage, the gold of temple decorations, the green of tropical plants growing from cracks in old buildings.

David walked beside Karen. He was quiet. He had been quiet since the mortuary. The quietness was not the silence of a man with nothing to say but the silence of a man whose capacity for speech had been temporarily exhausted, the reservoir drained by the two sentences he had spoken in the viewing room -- *That's Connor* -- the sentences that had required the last of his available language, the last of the energy that the emergency system provided.

They reached the hostel. The narrow door. The red lantern. The facade that looked like what it was -- an old building in a Chinatown that had been many things and was now a hostel and would be something else after the hostel, the building cycling through identities the way beds cycled through occupants.

They entered. The bell rang. Mei Ling looked up.

"Mr. and Mrs. Briggs."

The words were spoken with the care of a receptionist who had been told to expect them, who had been briefed by Razak, who had prepared the common room and asked Mama Siti to cook and who now stood behind the wooden counter and said their name and the name was the name of their dead son and the name was the last thing they wanted to hear and the first thing they needed to hear because the hearing confirmed that they were in the right place, the place where their son had lived, the place where the name was known.

Mei Ling led them upstairs. The staircase was narrow -- too narrow for two people to pass, the staircase that Connor had climbed every day, the staircase where the third step from the top squeaked. Karen stepped on the third step. The squeak was a small sound. The small sound was enormous. The small sound was the sound of a piece of the building responding to weight, the same piece that had responded to Connor's weight, the wood flexing under her foot the way it had flexed under his, the building's memory stored not in consciousness but in physics, in the compression and decompression of timber that had been walked on by a thousand bodies and would be walked on by a thousand more.

Dorm 3. The door was open. The room was the same room Priya had stood in the day before -- the eight bunks, the ceiling fan, the air well light, the smell of damp wood and Tiger Balm.

Bed 7. Lower bunk, right side, second from the back.

The French girl was out. The bed was made -- the white hostel sheet pulled tight, the pillow straight, the bed the bed of an occupant who was tidy, who folded her sheets in the morning, who would return in the evening and sleep and wake and leave and the bed would hold another body and the cycle would continue.

David walked to the bed. His hand found the bed frame. The wood was dark, smooth, worn by the oil of hands and the humidity of years. His fingers moved along the rail. His fingers found a groove. The groove was a letter. The letter was L. His fingers moved. E. N. A.

LENA.

He didn't know what the letters meant. He didn't know they were a name. He didn't know the name belonged to a twenty-two-year-old Swedish woman who had slept in this bed and been recruited by Felix and arrested carrying drugs to Thailand and was now in Kajang Prison awaiting trial. He didn't know that the letters were the previous occupant's mark, the same kind of mark that prisoners carved in walls and lovers carved in trees, the human compulsion to leave evidence of having been, to say *I was here* in a medium more durable than memory.

He thought the letters were damage. Just wear. Just the marks that buildings accumulated -- the scratches and dents and grooves of daily use, the entropy that age imposed on surfaces, the evidence of nothing in particular, the random record of a building's passage through time.

His hand rested on the letters. His hand held the bed frame the way it had held the phone in the hallway at 3 AM, the way it had held Karen's shoulder in the mortuary, the way it had held Connor's shoulder at the airport. The hand was the same hand. The hand was always the same hand. But the things it held kept changing, and the changes were the changes that the death had made, the death converting every object from a thing into a relic, every surface from a surface into a site, every touch from a gesture into a memorial.

Karen stood behind David. She looked at the bed. She did not touch it. She looked at the pillow and thought about her son's head on the pillow and the thought was the thought of a mother imagining the physical space her child had occupied and the imagining was the only way she could be with him now, the imagination the only bridge across the gap that death had opened, the gap between the mother and the child, the gap that was the width of a mortuary table and the depth of the earth and the distance of the twelve thousand kilometres and the immeasurable, uncrossable distance of death itself.

"This is where he slept," she said.

"This is where he slept."

David's repetition was confirmation. The repetition was the married couple's grammar -- the statement and the echo, the call and the response, the shared language that thirty-one years of marriage had developed, the language that was not just words but the pattern of words, the rhythm of speech that two people created when they had been speaking to each other long enough that the speaking was not communication but communion.

---

Mama Siti was in the kitchen.

She was always in the kitchen. The kitchen was her domain -- the stove, the rice cooker, the spice rack, the chopping board, the space that she had occupied since before the building was a hostel, the space where she performed the daily miracle of converting raw ingredients into the food that brought people back and held them and nourished them and was the only magic the building possessed that was not dark.

She had prepared nasi lemak. The nasi lemak was on two plates on the kitchen table -- the coconut rice, the sambal, the fried anchovies, the roasted peanuts, the hard-boiled egg, the cucumber slices. The arrangement was precise, the arrangement of a woman who cooked not just with skill but with intention, each element placed with the care that the food deserved and the eaters needed.

David and Karen sat at the table. They sat because Mama Siti gestured for them to sit, the gesture simple and commanding, the gesture of a woman who had been feeding people for longer than anyone could remember and whose authority in the kitchen was absolute.

Karen looked at the food. The food was unfamiliar -- the coconut rice, the sambal red and fragrant, the anchovies tiny and crisp. She had never eaten nasi lemak. She had never been to Malaysia. The food was the food of a country she had come to because her son had died in it, and the food was the first tangible thing the country offered her that was not grief or bureaucracy or the fluorescent-lit corridors of institutions.

She ate.

The food was good. The food was more than good -- the rice was rich and creamy, the sambal was hot and sweet and complex, the anchovies were salty and crunchy and the combination of all of it was the taste of a cuisine that had been developed over centuries by people who understood that food was not fuel but language, that a meal was not nourishment but communication, that the plate was a letter and the flavours were the words and the message was: *you are here, you are fed, you are held*.

Karen ate and the eating was the first normal thing she had done since the phone rang at 3 AM. The eating was the body's insistence on the body's needs, the body overriding the mind's objection that food was irrelevant when your child was dead, the body saying: *you are alive, and the alive must eat, and the eating is not betrayal but survival, and survival is the thing you have to do now because the alternative is the thing that happened to your son and you cannot follow him there, not yet, not this way*.

The food was the last thing Connor ate.

Karen didn't know this. Mama Siti did.

Mama Siti knew because Mama Siti had served Connor his last nasi lemak on the morning of Day 47, the morning he had come downstairs at six thirty with the look of a man who was about to do the thing he had been dreading and the dread was visible and the visibility was the thing that Mama Siti had seen and understood and filed in the place where she filed the things she knew about the people who passed through her kitchen, the knowledge that was not recorded and not spoken and not shared but was held, in the body, in the hands, in the memory of a woman who had been in this kitchen since before the hostel and would be in this kitchen after it.

Mama Siti watched Karen eat. She watched the way Karen held the fork -- tentatively, the grip of a person eating unfamiliar food in an unfamiliar place. She watched the way Karen chewed -- slowly, carefully, the chewing of a person who was tasting something for the first time and the first time was also the first time she had tasted what her son had tasted and the tasting was a kind of connection, the flavours a bridge between the living mother and the dead son, the sambal the shared experience that they could not have shared when he was alive because he was here and she was there and the distance was the distance of a family separated by a son's restlessness and a mother's inability to follow.

Mama Siti watched Karen eat and said nothing. The nothing was not silence. The nothing was restraint, the decision not to tell the mother that the food she was eating was the food her son had eaten on the morning he died, the decision that the information was a weight the mother did not need, a fact that would convert the meal from nourishment into archaeology, from food into evidence, from the taste of Malaysia into the taste of the last morning.

David ate too. He ate mechanically, the eating of a man who was performing a function rather than experiencing a pleasure, the fork-to-mouth rhythm of a body fuelling itself while the mind occupied a different room, a different country, a different time -- the time before the phone call, the time when Connor was alive and the monthly deposit was a worry but not a grief and the house in Hawthorn was a home and not a monument to a family that no longer existed in its original form.

Mama Siti sat across from them. She did not eat. She watched. Her face was the face of a woman who had watched many things -- the building's transformations, the occupants' arrivals and departures, the cycle of beds filled and emptied, the rhythm of a place that consumed people and was consumed by them. Her face was old. The age was not a number but a quality -- the quality of a face that had absorbed time rather than merely passed through it, the face that was a repository of the building's history, the face that knew.

She spoke. She spoke in English, her English careful, accented, the English of a woman who had learned the language not in school but in a kitchen, from the guests who passed through, the words accumulated over years the way the building accumulated marks.

"Your son," she said. "He was kind. He did not know he was kind, but he was. He sat in this kitchen. He tried to cook sambal. He burned his hand." She held up her own hand, showing the gesture. "He laughed. Always laughing. Even when he should not have been laughing. Even when the laughing was the thing that kept him from seeing."

Karen looked at Mama Siti. Karen's eyes were the eyes of a mother hearing someone describe her son, the particular pain and gratitude of hearing the dead described by someone who had known them in a place the mother had never been, the testimony of a stranger who was not a stranger because the stranger had fed her son and watched her son and known her son in the specific, daily, intimate way that the people who shared a kitchen knew each other.

"He ate here every morning," Mama Siti said. "Every morning, he came down the stairs and he said *Morning, Mama Siti* and I gave him nasi lemak and he ate and he said *legend* and the word meant thank you."

Karen's hand was on the table. Mama Siti's hand crossed the table and covered it. The two hands -- the Australian mother's hand and the Malaysian cook's hand, the hand that had held a photograph for eleven hours and the hand that had held a ladle for decades, the hand of grief and the hand of knowledge -- the two hands held each other across the kitchen table and the holding was the bridge between two women who had loved the same person in different ways and lost the same person in different ways and were now connected by the loss the way two shores were connected by the water between them, the water that was the grief that flowed between them and touched them both.

"Thank you for feeding him," Karen said.

Mama Siti's eyes were bright. The brightness was not tears -- Mama Siti did not cry, or if she did, she did not cry in kitchens, in front of guests, in the space where her authority was absolute. The brightness was the thing that preceded tears and sometimes replaced them, the internal pressure of a feeling too large for the vessel that held it.

"He is fed," Mama Siti said. The tense was ambiguous -- the present tense that could have been a statement about the past or a statement about a different present, the tense that Mama Siti used when she spoke about the dead, the tense that did not distinguish between the living and the gone because in Mama Siti's understanding, in the understanding that the building had taught her, the gone were not absent but relocated, not ended but elsewhere, and the elsewhere was a place where the kitchen reached and the food reached and the feeding continued.

---

Priya was in the common room.

She had been waiting. She had been waiting since she heard from Sarah Chen that the parents were coming to the hostel, since she had understood that the meeting she had been dreading and needing was going to happen, since she had sat on the edge of her bed in Private Room 2 and looked at the jade bracelet on her wrist and thought about what she would say to the mother of the man who had given it to her.

She had not prepared words. She had tried -- in the hours of waiting, she had composed sentences, discarded them, composed new ones, discarded those. The sentences were always wrong. The sentences were either too much or too little, too clinical or too emotional, too explanatory or too simple. The sentences failed because sentences were insufficient for the thing that the meeting required, the thing that lived beyond language, in the space where two kinds of love met and the meeting was not competition but communion, the mother's love and the girlfriend's love standing in the same room and the room holding both and the holding being the closest thing to enough that the situation allowed.

David and Karen came from the kitchen. Their faces carried the remains of the meal and the conversation with Mama Siti. David's face was composed -- the composure of a man who had decided that composure was the contribution he could make, the structural support that the situation required, the wall that held while the interior was in ruins. Karen's face was open -- the openness of a woman who had stopped trying to contain the thing that could not be contained, the grief that would not be managed or scheduled or limited to appropriate moments but would arrive when it arrived and express itself as it needed to express itself.

Karen saw Priya.

She knew. She knew the way mothers knew -- not from introduction or explanation but from the look, the posture, the quality of the grief on the young woman's face. The young woman sitting on the common room sofa with the battered Lonely Planet guide on the table and the jade bracelet on her wrist and the expression that was the expression of a person who had lost the person that the mother had lost and the loss was written on the face the way grief was always written on faces, the handwriting of the heart visible on the skin.

"You're Priya," Karen said.

"Yes."

Karen crossed the common room and sat beside Priya. She saw the glasses, the braid, the practical clothes, the jade bracelet.

"He bought that for me," Priya said. "At the night market. On Petaling Street. He saw me looking at it and he bought it. He said it was the same green as my eyes, which was wrong -- my eyes are brown. But he said it with such confidence that I didn't correct him. That was Connor. He was always confident about things he was wrong about."

Karen laughed. The laugh was the first sound she had made since the mortuary that was not grief -- the sound was the sound of recognition, the sound of hearing her son described in a way that she recognised, the precise, vivid description of a trait that she had known for twenty-seven years. The confidence about wrong things. The absolute, unshakeable certainty about matters he had not investigated. The charm that made the wrongness endearing rather than infuriating. She knew this. She had raised this.

The laugh became something else. The laugh became the sound that existed next to laughter, the sound that was laughter's neighbour, the sound that used the same muscles and the same breath but produced a different output. The sound was the sound of the mortuary. The sound was the sound of the hallway at 3 AM. The sound was the sound that had no name because naming it would have required the clinical distance that the sound made impossible.

Karen held Priya. The holding was sudden -- Karen's arms around Priya's shoulders, the embrace of a woman who had crossed a room and sat down and heard a story about a bracelet and laughed and then could not stop the other thing from coming, the thing that the laugh had opened the door to, the way a crack in a dam opened the door to the water.

Priya was held. Priya held back. The two women held each other on the sofa in the common room of the Lantern Hostel, the sofa where Connor had sat for six weeks, the sofa where Priya had kissed him and argued with him and said goodbye to him, the sofa that was the last piece of furniture in the building that held the shape of his body and the warmth of his presence and the echo of his voice saying *she'll be right, babe* in the way that meant nothing and everything.

They cried. The crying was not performative and was not restrained and was not the crying of a scene in a film where the tears were lit and the music swelled and the audience was moved by the beauty of the grief. The crying was the ugly, bodily, uncontrollable crying of two women who had lost the same man and who were now in the same room and the room was the room where he had been alive and the being-alive was what they were crying for, not the death but the life, not the loss but the having-had, the brief, insufficient, irreplaceable time when Connor Briggs was a person in this room and the room held him and they held him and the holding was the thing that was over.

David stood in the kitchen doorway. He watched his wife hold a woman he had never met and understood that the grief in this room was not his to enter -- mother and girlfriend, the knowledge of the beginning and the knowledge of the end.

Mama Siti appeared beside him. Hands folded in front of her apron. Eyes on the two women on the sofa.

"The same," she said softly. "Always the same."

The jade bracelet caught the light.

The ceiling fans turned.

Outside, on Petaling Street, the market continued its ancient commerce, and the vendors called their prices, and the incense rose from the temple, and the city breathed, and the breathing was the breathing of a place that held the living and the dead equally, without preference, without judgement, the breathing of a city that had been breathing for a hundred and fifty years and would breathe for a hundred and fifty more, the breathing that was the only permanence in a world of impermanence, the only constant in a world of change, the only thing that remained when everything else -- the people, the buildings, the names carved in bed frames, the blue towels, the jade bracelets, the nasi lemak, the love, the grief, the laughter, the crying -- when all of it was gone.

The parents had come.
# Chapter 46: The Photographs

The story ran on Tuesday.

Not page 7 this time. Not the brief, three-paragraph mention that Malaysian newspapers typically gave to deaths in custody -- the mention that was the system's acknowledgment of the event and the system's containment of the event, the mention that said *yes, this happened* in a voice quiet enough that the saying could be denied if the saying became inconvenient. Not the kind of story that appeared and disappeared in the same news cycle, consumed by the next day's headlines, digested by the public's appetite for new information and expelled from memory before the week was out.

Front page.

The Star led with the story. The headline ran across the full width of the page, above the fold, in the black bold typeface that The Star reserved for the stories that could not be contained in the body of the paper, the stories that demanded the architecture of the front page.

The headline said:

**DEATH IN CUSTODY: PHOTOS REVEAL DRUG NETWORK AT KL HOSTEL**

Below the headline, three photographs. The photographs were Tomoko's. The photographs were the fifty-nine frames reduced to three, the editorial selection that converted a photojournalist's body of work into the three images that told the story in the language that newspapers spoke most fluently -- the language of the visual, the image that the eye consumed before the mind engaged, the photograph that made the reader stop and read the text below.

Photograph one: Felix Decker at Wei's phone repair shop, seen through the window, Day 9. Felix in profile, his angular face lit by the shop's fluorescent strip light, his hand on the counter, Wei visible behind him, the shelves of phone cases and the door to the back room. The photograph was sharp, composed, the work of a professional photographer who had stood across the street with a long lens and captured the moment with the precision that separated documentation from art. The caption identified Felix as a German national wanted in connection with Connor's death. The photograph made Felix real -- not a name in a police statement but a face, a body, a man caught in the act of the mundane transaction that was the architecture of trafficking: two men in a shop, one counter between them, fluorescent light above.

Photograph two: Connor Briggs on Petaling Street, Day 10, a brown-paper package under his arm. He was walking. His face was visible -- the dirty blonde hair, the squint, the board shorts, the braided leather bracelet. He was walking with the unselfconscious stride of a man who did not know he was being photographed and did not know the package under his arm contained a substance that carried the mandatory death penalty and did not know that the walk he was taking was being documented by a woman with a camera who was building a case he didn't know existed about a crime he didn't know he was committing. The photograph was the last image of Connor Briggs as a free man. The photograph was the before. Everything after the photograph was the after.

Photograph three: The Lantern Hostel. The facade -- the narrow door, the red lantern, the pre-war plasterwork. The photograph was taken at night. The lantern was lit. The glow was warm and red and the glow was the hostel's face, the face it showed to the street, the invitation that it extended to every traveller who passed. The photograph was beautiful. The photograph was the photograph of a place that looked like shelter and had been a trap. Readers would linger on this photograph longest -- the image that made the ordinary sinister, that converted a building into a character, that said *this is where it happened* in the visual grammar of true crime that turned locations into landmarks of the terrible.

In the newsroom at The Star's offices in Petaling Jaya, Lim Wei Jie -- the crime beat reporter who had written the story, who had covered deaths in custody before, other deaths, other cells, other families -- watched the print run come in and held the front page in his hands. The ink was fresh. The photographs were vivid -- Tomoko's work reproduced at a resolution that preserved the detail, the grain, the quality that elevated the images from documentation to evidence. The newsroom around him was quiet in the way that newsrooms were quiet when they knew the paper had a story that would move -- the hush of journalists watching a colleague's work hit the street, the professional respect that replaced the usual noise of keyboards and phones and the ambient cynicism that was the newsroom's default emotional register.

Lim had been writing this story for years, in different iterations, with different names and different nationalities and different cells. This time the story had photographs. This time the story had a name that was not Malaysian. This time the story had an international dimension that converted a local death-in-custody story into a story that crossed borders.

The story was 2,400 words. It occupied the front page and continued on pages 4 and 5, with additional photographs and a sidebar headlined "Malaysia's Deaths in Custody: The Numbers." The sidebar listed 257 deaths in police and prison custody between 2000 and 2026, of which 89 were classified as suicide, and of which 14 had subsequently been reclassified following investigations or inquests. The numbers were the numbers that the system produced when the system was asked to account for itself, and the numbers were simultaneously the evidence of the problem and the evidence of the system's capacity to absorb the problem without changing.

By noon, the hashtag #JusticeForConnor was trending. By evening, the story had crossed borders -- The Guardian, ABC Australia, the BBC, twelve countries, several hundred thousand readers -- and the story was no longer a story about one person in one cell but a story about a system. The story had escaped the containment of page 7. The story was everywhere.

The Lantern Hostel was besieged by journalists on Wednesday morning.

They arrived at seven AM, the first of them -- a camera crew from TV3, the Malaysian television network, a reporter and a cameraman and a sound technician, the three-person unit that was the basic architecture of television journalism, the minimum crew required to convert a location into a story, a building into a backdrop, a doorway into a stage.

By eight AM, there were six crews. By nine, there were twelve. The narrow lane off Petaling Street, which was ordinarily the quiet passage between the phone repair shop and the Chinese medicine store, was now a corridor of cameras and microphones and the frenetic, self-generating energy of a media event, the energy that was generated when multiple news organisations converged on the same point and the convergence created a feedback loop -- each crew's presence justifying every other crew's presence, the collective attention validating the individual attention, the physics of news gathering producing its own gravity.

Mei Ling stood at the reception desk and turned them away.

She turned them away with the efficiency of a woman who had spent two years standing at this desk and dealing with every kind of person who walked through the narrow door -- the drunk, the lost, the demanding, the entitled, the police, the health inspector, the occasional rat. The journalists were a new category but the skill set was the same: firm, polite, unyielding.

"The hostel is not giving interviews. Please direct your inquiries to the police."

"Is the owner available?"

"The owner is not available for comment."

"Can we see the room where Briggs stayed?"

"The hostel is a private establishment. Guests have a right to privacy."

"Is it true that the hostel was used as a base for drug trafficking?"

"Please direct your inquiries to the police."

The journalists filmed the facade. They filmed the red lantern. They filmed the narrow door. They filmed the lane and the phone repair shop -- sealed, padlocked, police tape -- and the Chinese medicine store and the Guan Di Temple at the corner. They filmed Petaling Street and the market stalls and the vendors who watched the filming with the bemused indifference of people who had been selling watches and handbags on this street for decades and had seen stranger things than a pack of journalists outside a hostel. One reporter did a piece to camera standing in front of the red lantern, the lantern framed behind her left shoulder, the iconic image already forming -- the lantern that would become the visual shorthand for the story, the way certain images attached themselves to certain stories and became inseparable from them, the lantern the story's logo.

Mei Ling watched from behind the desk. She had called Razak at 6:45 AM, when the first van pulled up. Razak had said: "Turn them away. Be polite. Say nothing." The instructions were clear. The execution was Mei Ling's, and Mei Ling executed with the practised competence of a woman who had grown up in the service industry in Kuala Lumpur and had learned early that the face you showed to the world was not the face you wore behind it. Her face showed calm. Behind the calm was the calculation of a person who had worked at this hostel for two years and who was now calculating the number of weeks of employment she had remaining, the calculation producing a number that was smaller than she wanted and larger than she feared.

Inside the hostel, the guests watched from the common room window. The French girl from Bed 7 sat on the sofa and watched the cameras through the glass and she did not know why the cameras were there because she had not read the newspaper and did not know the history of the bed she slept in and did not know that the building she was staying in was now famous for the terrible reason that buildings became famous when someone died in them. A German backpacker, newly arrived, stood behind her and filmed the journalists on his phone, filming the people who were filming the building, the recursive loop of documentation that the media age produced when events attracted attention and the attention attracted more attention and the multiplication was infinite.

Razak gave one interview, to The Star, to Lim Wei Jie. His confession -- "I chose money over morality. I am responsible." -- ran as the next day's headline on page 4, the quote extracted and enlarged across two columns, the sentence that was simple and damning and human in a way that the rest of the story was not.

The PDRM issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon.

The statement was read by a press officer at a press conference at Bukit Aman, the national police headquarters. The press officer was a woman in her forties, uniformed, professional, the face and voice of the institution that was being asked to account for a death that had occurred within its custody. She read from a prepared text -- the language measured, careful, legalistic, the language that said everything and nothing, that acknowledged without admitting, that addressed without answering.

"The Royal Malaysia Police takes all deaths in custody seriously. The death of Mr. Connor James Briggs at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters is under active investigation. A murder inquiry has been opened. Two arrests have been made in connection with the case. International warrants have been issued for two additional suspects. The investigation is ongoing. No further details can be provided at this time."

The journalists asked questions. The questions probed the gap between the statement and the reality, the gap that the statement was designed to close and that the questions were designed to keep open.

"Is it true that the initial report classified the death as suicide?"

"The initial report reflected the preliminary assessment. The subsequent investigation has led to the current classification."

"How many deaths in custody have been initially classified as suicide and later reclassified?"

"I don't have that information available at this time."

"Is there any connection between this case and other deaths in custody involving the suspect known as Rizal?"

"The investigation is ongoing. No further details can be provided."

"Will there be an inquest?"

"The matter of an inquest is for the coroner to determine."

Twelve minutes. The press conference lasted twelve minutes and produced twelve minutes of the unsatisfying, choreographed theatre of institutional accountability -- questions asked and not answered, the not-answering itself the answer, the institutional voice saying *we acknowledge the event, we are investigating the event, we cannot discuss the event*, the opacity that was the system's defence against the light that the questions brought. The press officer left the podium. The journalists packed their equipment. The footage would air on the evening news and the footage would show what it always showed -- a podium, a uniform, a prepared text, the choreography of a system performing accountability without being accountable, the dance that the system had perfected over decades and that the press conference format enabled because the format was designed for statements, not for truth, and the twelve minutes were the system's statement and the statement was: *we are here, we are speaking, and the speaking is the thing we are offering you in place of the thing you are asking for*.

The Malaysian Home Minister was asked about the case on Thursday, during Question Time in Parliament.

The question came from a member of the opposition from Petaling Jaya, a woman named Siti Mariam who had been asking questions about deaths in custody for six years -- the same questions, the same answers, the same gap between the asking and the answering that never closed. She had a folder on her desk. The folder contained the names of families who had written to her office, the names of the dead and the names of the living who carried the dead, the names that were the human substance of the statistics that the government declined to cite.

"Yang Berhormat Menteri, in light of the recent death of Australian national Connor Briggs at Dang Wangi police station, and the subsequent opening of a murder investigation, can the Minister confirm how many deaths in police custody have occurred in the past five years, and how many of those deaths were initially classified as suicide?"

The Home Minister stood. He had developed the particular skill of responding to questions without answering them -- the practised art of the public figure who understood that every word spoken in Parliament was recorded and every record was permanent.

"Every death in custody is investigated," the Home Minister said. "The government takes the welfare of detainees seriously. The case of Mr. Briggs is under active investigation by the Royal Malaysia Police. I have every confidence in the investigation. The government's commitment to the rule of law and to the rights of all persons in custody is unwavering."

He did not say how many deaths there had been. He did not mention the number 257. He did not mention the 89 classified as suicide. He did not mention the 14 that had been reclassified, or the 75 that had not -- the 75 that remained on the books as suicides, that existed now only in folders in filing cabinets and in the memories of families who believed what Priya believed and what the Briggs family believed, that the word *suicide* was a wall and behind the wall was a different word.

He did not mention the three other deaths that Rizal was connected to -- Taiping in 2022, Johor Bahru in 2023, Shah Alam in 2024 -- deaths that had been classified as suicides and that were now being reviewed, the files reopened, the investigations re-initiated by a system that was being forced, by the pressure of a front-page story and international attention that a dead Australian generated in a way that dead Malaysians often did not, to look again at the things it had chosen not to see.

He said: "Every death in custody is investigated."

Siti Mariam sat down. She placed her hands on the folder. The folder remained closed. The names inside the folder remained unspoken. The names would be spoken another day, in another Question Time, the cycle continuing -- the asking and the not-answering and the gap between them that was the space in which the families waited.

The non-answer was recorded in Hansard. The recording was the democracy's method of preserving the non-answer for future reference, the record that said: *this question was asked, and this was what was said, and what was said was not what was asked, and the gap between the two is the gap that persists*.

At Kajang Prison, fifty kilometres south of Kuala Lumpur, a woman named Nurul -- Mama Siti's niece, mid-twenties, fourteen months into a sentence for trafficking under Section 39B -- read a two-day-old copy of The Star that had been passed hand to hand through the informal distribution system of the prison.

She read about the Lantern Hostel. She read about Petaling Street. She read about Felix Decker. She read about Connor Briggs, a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had been recruited in the same hostel where she had been recruited two years earlier, by a man who was not Felix but who was Felix's predecessor, the previous handler, the previous occupant of the private room on the third floor.

She had been silent for fourteen months. The silence was survival -- the network had people inside the prison, and the people who spoke about the network were the people who were silenced, in cells, at night, with towels or sheets or the improvised ligatures that the system's failures made available.

She read about Mama Siti. The newspaper mentioned Mama Siti only in passing -- "the hostel's long-serving cook" -- but the mention was enough. The mention was the name that Nurul knew, the name that was not just a name but a history, the history of a family that had been entangled in the network's operations through the building where the family's matriarch cooked and the building's owner had made an arrangement and in that space Nurul had been recruited, two years ago, by the previous handler, the previous occupant of the private room on the third floor.

She put the newspaper down. She sat on her bed and looked at the wall and the wall was concrete and the concrete was the same colour as the concrete of every cell in every prison in Malaysia and the colour was the colour of containment.

She made a decision. The decision was not sudden. The decision had been forming for fourteen months, the way a stalactite formed -- slowly, invisibly, the accumulation of drops, each drop too small to be a decision but the accumulation eventually producing a structure that was a decision, a solid thing, a thing with shape and weight and consequence.

She called for the guard.

"I want to speak to a lawyer," Nurul said. "From SUARAM."

The word changed the guard's expression. SUARAM -- Suara Rakyat Malaysia -- was the human rights organisation that had been documenting deaths in custody for decades, the organisation that existed on the other side of the wall that separated the system from the people who questioned the system.

"I want to give a statement," Nurul said. "About the network. About the hostel. About the man who recruited me. About the man who recruited the Australian. About all of it."

The guard left to file the request. The request would take days. But the request had been made and the making was the first sound after fourteen months of silence, the first word in a statement that would add to the case that Ahmad was building -- the case that had started with Priya's letter and Tomoko's photographs and Razak's confession and that was growing, document by document, into the mass that the system required to hold itself accountable.

Nurul lay on her bed. The fluorescent light buzzed -- the same light that had been on in Connor's cell, the universal light of custody, the light that illuminated without warming, that was on when the living were there and on when the dead were there. She thought about the decision she had made. The decision was dangerous. The decision might get her killed in the same way that Connor Briggs had been killed. But the decision had been made and the making was irreversible.

The story was out. The story could not be put back. The story was the light that the system had tried to prevent by calling the death a suicide and filing the report and closing the case and moving on. The light was on the front page and on the internet and in the Parliament and in the prison and in the cell where Nurul lay with her eyes closed and her decision made, and the decision was a light too, a small light, the light of one person choosing to speak after fourteen months of choosing not to, the light that was not enough to illuminate everything but was enough to illuminate something, and the something was a start, and the start was the thing that the system feared most.

The fluorescent light buzzed.

Nurul waited for the lawyer.

The story continued.
# Chapter 47: The Reckoning

Razak closed the hostel on a Wednesday.

He stood in the common room at 7 AM and watched the last guests leave -- a Korean couple who had seen the police tape and the forensic team and the headlines on their phones. They paid in cash and left without speaking, their rolling suitcases bumping down the narrow staircase. The bell rang once and settled.

Silence. Forty-two empty beds in six rooms on three floors. A kitchen without a cook -- Mama Siti had not come in since the news broke. The sambal pot was clean, upside down on the drying rack.

Razak climbed the staircase to Dorm 3. The room had been stripped by the forensic team, the mattresses bare. Bed 7 was in the far corner, bottom bunk, against the wall. The towel was gone -- sealed in an evidence bag at Dang Wangi, transformed from an object of comfort into an object of law.

Names were scratched into the bed frame. LENA, in thin, precise letters -- the Swedish girl who had slept here and been recruited here and was now in Kajang Prison. Below LENA, other names: TOM. JULIE. HANS. Connor's name was not scratched into the bed. Connor had not left a mark on the wood. The bed did not remember Connor. The bed was a bed.

Razak descended to his office. The newspaper clippings covered the walls. The map with its red pins hung above the desk, each pin marking a hostel where someone had died. There was a new pin. Kuala Lumpur. The Lantern Hostel. This pin was different from the others. The others marked deaths he had read about. This pin marked a death that had happened in his building, facilitated by his silence, enabled by his arrangement with a network he had tolerated because tolerance was easier than resistance.

"I'm sorry," he said to the map.

He locked the front door and pocketed the key. The red lanterns stayed on -- the lanterns were on a separate circuit that Razak had never turned off. He walked down Petaling Street toward Pasar Seni while the hostel behind him sat empty and the lanterns glowed for no one.

Ahmad interviewed Wei at the remand centre at Sungai Buloh.

The interview room was standard -- a table bolted to the floor, two chairs on each side, a camera in the corner, fluorescent lighting. The room was designed for function, not comfort: a space in which information was exchanged under conditions of asymmetric power, the interviewer holding the authority and the interviewee holding the information and the exchange requiring the careful calibration of pressure and release that was the art of interrogation.

Wei sat on the far side of the table. He was smaller than Ahmad had expected -- a thin man, early forties, Malaysian-Chinese, with the careful posture of a person who had spent his life in rooms where precision mattered. His hands were on the table, palms down, the fingers long and fine-boned, the hands of a technician. The hands that had assembled the packages. The hands that had sealed the methamphetamine in vacuum bags and placed the bags in charger boxes and backpack linings and suitcase walls. The hands were still now. The hands were on a table in an interview room and the stillness of the hands was the stillness of a man who was calculating the cost of every word he was about to speak.

Wei's lawyer sat beside him. Encik Ibrahim, a criminal defence lawyer from a firm on Jalan Sultan Ismail, retained by the network. The lawyer was there because the network's protocol included legal representation for arrested operatives -- the protocol recognising that legal representation was not a gesture of care for the operative but a mechanism of control, the lawyer's function not to defend the client but to manage the information that the client disclosed, to ensure that the client's cooperation served the client's survival without endangering the network's infrastructure.

But the lawyer's calculation had changed. The lawyer had reviewed the evidence. The lawyer had seen the CCTV footage that Tomoko's photographs had led Ahmad's team to subpoena -- the footage from Wei's own shop cameras, the cameras that recorded every pickup and drop-off, the cameras that showed Connor Briggs entering the back room on Day 39 and receiving a charger box, the cameras that showed Felix Decker and Wei in conversation over a table covered in packaging materials. The lawyer had seen the phone records. The lawyer had seen the banking transactions. The lawyer had seen the quantity -- four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in the suitcase, plus the accumulated evidence of months of trafficking operations.

The lawyer had done the math. The math was Section 39B. The math was the mandatory death penalty for trafficking in dangerous drugs. The math was the difference between cooperation and silence, between information exchanged for a reduced charge and silence maintained until the gallows.

The same law that had ensnared Connor -- the law of which Connor had been ignorant, the law whose existence Connor had dismissed as "that's for big-time dealers" -- the same law now motivated Wei to speak. The irony was structural, built into the architecture of the legal system: the law was a pressure, and the pressure was applied equally to the ignorant mule and the knowing supplier, and the pressure produced different responses -- the mule's panic, the supplier's calculation -- but the pressure was the same pressure, and the source of the pressure was the same seven words that appeared at the top of every briefing, every warning, every sign that Connor had failed to read: *Mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking.*

"My client is prepared to cooperate," Encik Ibrahim said. The sentence was formal, rehearsed, the legal preamble to the transaction that was about to occur. "He will provide information about the network's structure, supply chains, and operatives in exchange for the prosecution's agreement to pursue charges under Section 39A rather than 39B."

Section 39A: trafficking, reduced charge, fifteen to thirty years. Section 39B: trafficking, mandatory death. The difference between the two sections was the difference between a sentence and a death warrant, between years in a cell and a noose around a neck, between a future that was diminished and a future that did not exist. The difference was the lawyer's leverage.

Ahmad nodded. "The prosecution has agreed in principle, pending the quality of the information provided. This interview is recorded. Begin."

Wei began.

He began with the supply chain. The methamphetamine came from a lab in Shan State, Myanmar, transported overland through northern Thailand, across the border at Sadao, down the peninsula to KL. The route had been operational for four years. The volume was approximately two kilograms per month, distributed through seven cells in Peninsular Malaysia -- KL, Penang, Johor Bahru, Ipoh, Kuantan, Malacca, Kota Bharu. Wei ran the KL cell. His function was logistics: receiving the raw product, packaging it for transport, and coordinating the local distribution through couriers.

"The couriers," Ahmad said. "Tell me about the couriers."

Wei's hands moved on the table. A small movement -- the fingers shifting, the palms lifting slightly, the adjustment of a man who was about to describe the part of the operation that most directly implicated him in a boy's death.

"There are two types. Local couriers -- Malaysians, paid, permanent. They handle the domestic routes. KL to Penang, KL to JB, the regular distribution. And foreign couriers. Backpackers. Tourists."

"Mules."

"Yes."

"How are they recruited?"

"Felix handles recruitment. Only Felix. That's his function. He lives in hostels. He identifies targets -- young, Western, broke, naive. He builds relationships. He starts with small favours -- envelopes, packages. He escalates. By the time the target understands what they're carrying, they're too deep. The CCTV records every pickup. Felix shows them the footage. They're trapped."

"How many?"

Wei was quiet for a moment. The quiet was the sound of a man counting, and the counting was the counting of bodies -- not dead bodies, but the bodies that had been used, the bodies that had carried the product, the bodies that had been trapped in the system the same way Connor had been trapped.

"In KL, since I started. Eight. Connor was the eighth."

Eight. The number sat in the room like a verdict. Eight young people, over four years, recruited from the common room of the Lantern Hostel, introduced to a charming German who bought them beers and told them stories and gradually, methodically, turned them into couriers for a methamphetamine supply chain that stretched from the hills of Myanmar to the streets of Malaysian cities.

"Names," Ahmad said.

Wei provided names. Some were first names only -- the transient nature of hostel relationships meaning that Wei knew the mules by the names they used at check-in, the names that might be real or might be the names they travelled under, the names that were entered in the hostel's guest book in Razak's careful handwriting and that were now evidence.

"Lena Ekström. Swedish. Twenty-two. Recruited fourteen months ago. Arrested at Bukit Kayu Hitam, carrying for the Thai border route. She's in Kajang now."

"I know," Ahmad said. "She's asked for a lawyer."

"She'll talk. She has the same information I have. Felix's name. The hostel. The pattern."

"Who else?"

Wei named six more. An American. A New Zealander. Two Britons. An Australian woman, before Connor. A Canadian. Some had been arrested. Some had completed their routes and moved on, the network releasing them with the understanding that their fingerprints were on file and the CCTV was stored and the information was leverage that could be activated at any time, the leverage the network's insurance against the mules' testimony.

"The ones who were arrested," Ahmad said. "What happened to them?"

Wei looked at his lawyer. His lawyer looked at the table.

"Two were arrested and convicted. They're serving sentences under Section 39A -- they cooperated, like me, and the charges were reduced. One was arrested and..." Wei stopped. His hands lifted a centimetre off the table and settled again. "One was arrested and died in custody."

Ahmad leaned forward. "Which one?"

"The first one. Two and a half years ago. A man named Daniel Park. Korean-American. Twenty-four. He was arrested with 200 grams of meth at a bus terminal in JB. He was taken to the Johor Bahru district police station. He died in his cell. The report said suicide."

"Was it?"

Wei's hands were still on the table. The hands that had packaged the drugs that Daniel Park had carried. The hands that had sealed the vacuum bags and handed them to Felix and Felix had handed them to Daniel and Daniel had put them in his bag and walked to a bus terminal and been arrested and taken to a cell and died.

"It was the same as Connor. The network's protocol. When a mule is caught, the mule is silenced. The network has contacts in the police. A prisoner is placed in the cell. The guard takes a break. The death is staged as suicide."

The room was silent. The fluorescent light buzzed. The camera recorded. The silence was the silence of a system describing itself, the silence that followed the revelation that the system's efficiency included the efficiency of murder, the efficiency of silencing the people who could expose the system, the efficiency that converted a human problem into a logistical solution.

"Daniel Park," Ahmad said. He wrote the name in his notebook. The name was the second name, after Connor Briggs, in what would become a list of names -- the names of people who had been killed by the network's protocol, the names that the investigation would uncover over the coming months, the names that would appear in the court documents and the newspaper articles and the parliamentary inquiry.

"Connor Briggs," Ahmad said. "Walk me through it."

Wei walked through it. The recruitment. The escalation. The suitcase. The checkpoint. The arrest. The protocol. The guard -- Hafiz, night shift, paid three thousand ringgit in cash, delivered by an intermediary whose name Wei did not know. The prisoner -- the man they called Rizal, whose real name Wei did not know, whose function in the network was the function that no one discussed, the function that existed at the bottom of the organisational chart, below the suppliers and the packagers and the distributors and the recruiters, the function that was activated when all other functions had failed, the function of silence.

"Rizal," Ahmad said. "How do I find him?"

"You don't. He finds the network. He's contracted. He's not permanent. He operates across the region -- KL, Bangkok, Jakarta. He has multiple identities. He enters the cell as a petty criminal, does the job, is released the next morning, disappears."

"Released how?"

"The same officer who arranges the break. Hafiz, in this case. The record shows the petty criminal was released on bail. The bail is posted by a proxy. The record is clean."

Ahmad wrote. The writing was methodical, unhurried, the writing of a man who had been building a case for six months and had just received the testimony that connected the dots, that drew the lines between the nodes, that converted a suspicion into a provable pattern. The pattern was what Ahmad needed. The pattern was the evidence that this was not a single death but a system, not an incident but a method, not a tragedy but a business model.

"Felix Decker," Ahmad said. "Where is he?"

"Cambodia. Phnom Penh. He flew out on Thursday afternoon, twelve hours before Connor's arrest. He always leaves before the arrest. That's his protocol."

"How do you know he's in Cambodia?"

"He called me. Saturday morning. From a Cambodian number. He asked if the protocol had been completed. I told him it had."

Ahmad looked at Wei. The look was the look of a man who had heard a confession that was also an admission of complicity in murder -- the phone call in which one man asked another man if a third man had been killed, and the second man confirmed that the third man had been killed, and the conversation was conducted with the businesslike efficiency of two men confirming a logistics update.

"You told him the protocol had been completed," Ahmad repeated.

"Yes."

"Meaning you confirmed that Connor Briggs had been killed."

"Yes."

The word was flat. The word was the word of a man who had accepted that the word was the price of the other word -- the word that meant thirty years instead of death, the word that meant a cell instead of a gallows, the word that meant survival. Wei had made his calculation. The calculation was the same calculation that the law imposed on everyone it touched: the calculation of self-preservation, the arithmetic of survival, the mathematics of a system in which every participant was simultaneously a perpetrator and a potential victim.

Ahmad closed his notebook. He looked at Wei's hands on the table. The hands were still. The hands would remain still for a very long time -- the years of incarceration reducing the hands' function to the eating of prison food and the turning of prison-issue pages and the occasional writing of letters that no one would answer. The hands that had packaged methamphetamine would package nothing. The hands that had sealed the vacuum bags would seal nothing. The hands were finished.

"We're done for today," Ahmad said.

Nurul's testimony arrived via video link from Kajang Prison.

The screen showed a room -- a small, bare room with a table and a chair and a wall painted the institutional green that was the Malaysian prison system's colour of containment. Nurul sat at the table. She was twenty-four. She had been in Kajang for eleven months. Her face was thinner than the face in the photograph that Mama Siti kept in her wallet -- the photograph of a girl at a family gathering, round-cheeked, smiling, wearing a bright blue tudung, the photograph of a girl who had not yet been recruited and arrested and convicted and sentenced and transformed from a niece into a prisoner.

Nurul wore the prison uniform. Her hands were folded on the table. Her eyes were steady. The steadiness was not strength in the conventional sense -- it was the steadiness of a person who had spent eleven months processing the thing that had happened to her and had arrived at a state that was not acceptance but was the thing that existed beyond the exhaustion of all alternatives to acceptance.

"My name is Nurul binti Hassan. I was arrested on 14 March at the Butterworth bus terminal in Penang state. I was carrying a backpack that contained approximately three hundred grams of methamphetamine. I was charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. I was convicted. I am currently serving a life sentence, reduced from the death penalty under the court's discretion."

The words were practiced. The words had been spoken before -- to lawyers, to judges, to the prison counsellor. But the words were being spoken now to a camera that was connected to a screen in Ahmad's office at Dang Wangi, and the audience was different, and the purpose was different, and the difference was that the words were no longer a confession but a corroboration, a pattern piece, a second data point that, when placed beside the first data point of Connor Briggs, created a line, and the line pointed toward the system.

"I was recruited at the Lantern Hostel," Nurul said. "Petaling Street, Chinatown, KL. I was not a guest. I worked there -- I helped my aunt, Siti binti Ahmad, the cook. I was in the kitchen every morning. I lived with my aunt in her flat in Cheras but I spent most of the day at the hostel."

She paused. The pause was the breath before the part of the story that cost the most to tell.

"A man named Felix approached me. He was a guest. A foreigner. German. He was polite. He was charming. He said he needed someone local, someone who spoke Malay, to help with a delivery business he was setting up. Import-export. Phone accessories. He offered me five hundred ringgit a week, cash, no questions."

Ahmad listened. The listening was not passive -- the listening was the active, analytical listening of an investigator hearing a second testimony that matched a first testimony, the details aligning, the pattern emerging from the overlap. Felix. The Lantern Hostel. The charm. The offer. The phone accessories.

"He started me with envelopes," Nurul said. "Small. Sealed. Delivered to addresses in KL. Then packages. Then backpacks. The contents got heavier. I didn't ask. He told me not to ask. He said asking was bad for business."

The pattern. The identical pattern. The escalation from envelopes to packages to backpacks. The instruction not to ask. The progression that was not improvised but designed, the recruitment method that was a system, a process, a replicable template that Felix applied to each new target with the consistency of a manufacturing process -- the same inputs producing the same outputs, the same charm producing the same trust, the same trust producing the same compliance, the same compliance producing the same crime.

"When did you learn what you were carrying?" Ahmad asked.

"After six weeks. I found a bag that had torn. White powder inside. I confronted Felix. He said it was nothing -- protein powder, supplements. I didn't believe him. I told him I wanted to stop."

"What happened?"

"He showed me CCTV footage. From the shop two doors down -- the phone repair shop. The footage showed me picking up packages, putting them in my bag. He said if I stopped, the footage would go to police. He said if I went to police myself, the footage showed me but not him. He said the evidence pointed to me. I was the one on camera. I was the one carrying."

The trap. The identical trap. The CCTV as leverage, the footage as insurance, the mule's own actions converted into evidence against the mule, the system's recursive logic ensuring that the person who could expose the system was the person most endangered by the exposure. Connor had been trapped the same way. Daniel Park had been trapped the same way. Eight mules, the same trap, the same method, the same calculated, professional, systematic destruction of eight lives.

"I continued for three more months," Nurul said. "I carried larger amounts. The last delivery was the Penang route. A backpack with three hundred grams. Felix said it would be the last one. Felix always said it would be the last one."

"Tell me about the arrest."

"Butterworth bus terminal. A random check. The police found the methamphetamine in the backpack's hidden compartment. They arrested me. They charged me under 39B. The mandatory death penalty."

"And then?"

"I was in Kajang for four months before my trial. During those four months, I received a visit from a man. He said he was a lawyer. He gave me a name, a firm. He said he was there to help me, sent by friends. He asked me what I had told the police. I told him I had given the police nothing. The man said that was good. The man said that if I continued to give the police nothing, the firm would represent me and seek a reduced charge."

"The firm represented you at trial?"

"Yes. They negotiated the reduction from 39B to a life sentence. They told me to plead guilty to trafficking but to say I acted alone. No mention of Felix. No mention of the hostel. No mention of the network."

"And you agreed."

"I agreed. I was twenty-three. The alternative was death. I agreed."

The video feed was steady. Nurul's face was steady. The steadiness held everything -- the months of isolation, the four months of pre-trial detention, the trial, the sentence, the eleven months of incarceration, the accumulation of time and silence and the particular loneliness of a woman who had been recruited by a charming foreigner and arrested with a backpack of methamphetamine and abandoned by the network that had recruited her and defended by the lawyers that the network had sent and convicted on the terms that the network had negotiated. The network had managed every stage of her destruction, from recruitment to conviction, with the same efficiency that it managed the supply chain. Nurul was not a person to the network. Nurul was a logistics problem that had been solved.

"Why are you speaking now?" Ahmad asked. The question was the question that the investigation needed answered -- the question of motivation, the question of why a woman who had been silent for eleven months was now, after learning of Connor Briggs's death, willing to provide the testimony that could expose the network.

Nurul looked at the camera. The look was direct, unblinking, the look of a person who had arrived at the place beyond fear.

"Because he died," she said. "Because the Australian boy died the way Daniel died. Because I was supposed to die too -- did you know that? I was supposed to die in my cell. The protocol. But the prison moved me to a different wing the night before. A routine transfer. Administrative. The man they sent -- the one like Rizal -- he arrived at an empty cell. I was in a different wing and I was alive because of paperwork. Because of a form that someone filed that moved me from one wing to another. Paperwork saved my life."

The room was silent. The video feed continued. Nurul's face on the screen was the face of a woman who had been saved by bureaucracy, by the arbitrary, impersonal, procedural machinery of a prison system that had moved her from one cell to another without knowing that the move was the difference between her life and her death.

"I've been silent for eleven months because I was afraid. I'm not afraid anymore. The boy died. If I stay silent, another one dies. There will be another one. There is always another one."

---

Mama Siti visited Nurul on a Thursday afternoon.

The visiting room at Kajang Women's Prison was divided by a wall of glass -- thick, scratched by years of hands pressed against it. Mama Siti sat on the visitors' side wearing her apron, the white cotton apron stained with turmeric and chilli. She had not removed it. She had worn it through the LRT and the prison registration and the waiting, the apron that said *I am the cook, I am the one who feeds*.

Nurul appeared on the other side. She picked up the handset.

"Anak," Mama Siti said. *Child.*

"Mak Cik." *Auntie.*

"There was a boy. An Australian. He slept in the bed. The same bed."

"Bed 7," Nurul said.

"Bed 7."

"He was like me? Felix? Envelopes first, then packages?"

"Yes."

"He's dead," Nurul said. Not a question. "In custody. The protocol."

"Yes."

Nurul's eyes were wet but the wetness did not fall. "I should have spoken. Eleven months. I should have spoken on the first day."

"You were afraid."

"I was afraid. And the boy is dead because I was afraid."

Mama Siti pressed her hand against the glass. Nurul pressed hers from the other side. Palm to palm, finger to finger, separated by the thickness of institutional glass. The glass was cold on both sides.

"You can't stop it," Nurul said.

"I know."

"But you'll cook."

"I'll cook," Mama Siti said.

"Bring nasi lemak," Nurul said -- half joke, half plea.

Mama Siti looked at her niece through the glass. "I'll bring nasi lemak."

She walked out into the Kajang afternoon, an old woman in an apron heading for a train station, heading home to cook because cooking was the only answer she had to the question the system kept asking.

The hostel would reopen. The beds would be filled. The ceiling fans would turn.

*End of Chapter 47*
# Chapter 48: The Next One

Six weeks later, the Lantern Hostel was open.

This is how quickly the world forgets: six weeks. Six weeks between Connor Briggs dying in a holding cell and the return to normalcy at the building where he had lived for forty-seven days and slept in Bed 7 and eaten nasi lemak and carried packages and loved a woman and ignored the warnings and done all the things that a living person did in a building that housed the living until the living became the dead and the building continued without them.

Six weeks. In six weeks, the investigation had moved from the hostel to the courts. The media had moved from the hostel to the next story. The guests had moved from avoidance to curiosity to indifference. The Hostelworld reviews had moved from one-star warnings ("Someone DIED here, avoid!!!") to three-star qualifications ("Heard about the incident but the hostel seems fine now, good nasi lemak") to the standard four-star assessments that made no mention of death at all ("Great location, friendly staff, would stay again, wifi is a bit slow").

The world forgot. This was not cruelty. This was the world's mechanism for continuing -- catastrophe into history, history into amnesia, amnesia into a hostel listing on a booking website: THE LANTERN HOSTEL. RM35-85/NIGHT. FREE BREAKFAST. WIFI. WALKING DISTANCE TO PETALING STREET. 7.6/10 (352 REVIEWS).

The rating had dropped from 7.8 to 7.6. Two tenths of a point. That was the quantified cost of Connor Briggs's death on the hostel's commercial viability -- two tenths of a rating point, the aggregate effect of twelve one-star reviews posted in the weeks after the news broke, diluted by the three hundred and forty reviews that preceded them and the steady accumulation of new reviews from new guests who did not know or did not care about the death that had made the building temporarily famous and was now making it famous for something else, which was the same thing it had always been famous for, which was the nasi lemak and the red lanterns and the location and the view of the Petronas Towers from the rooftop.

The hostel was open. The beds were full. The ceiling fans turned. Mama Siti cooked. Mei Ling manned the reception. Razak was absent -- Razak had stepped back from daily operations, his role in the investigation requiring his presence at police stations and lawyers' offices more than at the hostel he owned. A temporary manager, a young man named Hafizul who had previously managed a hostel in George Town, handled the bookings and the complaints and the daily business of keeping forty-two beds occupied and the building functional.

The investigation continued in the background, the way investigations did -- slowly, bureaucratically, through the accumulation of documents and the scheduling of hearings and the procedural choreography of a legal system that moved at the speed of paperwork rather than the speed of grief. Wei was in remand at Sungai Buloh, cooperating, his testimony building the case file page by page. Hafiz, the guard, had been arrested and charged with accepting a bribe and facilitating a homicide. Felix Decker was the subject of an international warrant issued through Interpol, the warrant circulating through the law enforcement databases of twelve countries, the warrant a digital ghost pursuing a physical man who was, according to the intelligence, operating out of a hostel in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a country with which Malaysia had an extradition treaty that was, like many extradition treaties, easier to invoke than to execute.

The story was in the courts. The story was in the Star's archive, searchable but no longer front-page. The story was on Tomoko's Instagram, where her photographs had been viewed 4.7 million times and shared by accounts with names like @TrueCrimeDaily and @BackpackerSafety and @JusticeForConnor. The story was on the #JusticeForConnor hashtag, which had trended for nine days and then declined in the way that all hashtags declined -- not because the cause became less just but because the algorithm moved on and the algorithm was the arbiter of attention and the attention span of the internet was measured in news cycles and the news cycles were measured in days and the days had passed.

Connor's parents had taken his body home. The repatriation had taken eleven days -- eleven days of consular paperwork and morgue releases and embalming procedures and flight arrangements and the grinding bureaucracy of moving a dead body across international borders, the bureaucracy that required certificates and permissions and the payment of fees that were the administrative cost of death, the invoices that arrived in the mailbox of a house in Hawthorn while the occupants of the house were in a state of grief that made the opening of mail an act of superhuman effort.

Connor was buried in a cemetery in Kew, three suburbs from the house where he'd grown up. The funeral was attended by two hundred people -- family, friends from school, his mother's medical colleagues, his father's business associates, the community of Hawthorn that had known the Briggs family for thirty years and that attended the funeral not because they had known Connor well (many had not seen him since he was a teenager) but because the funeral was the community's ritual of acknowledgement, the collective recognition that a member of the community's extended family had been lost and the loss required the physical presence of bodies in a chapel and the speaking of words and the lowering of a coffin into ground that was, in a different hemisphere and a different climate, the same ground -- the earth, the dirt, the surface of a planet that received bodies without distinction.

The funeral was over. The investigation continued. The hostel was open.

And on a Tuesday evening, six weeks and two days after Connor Briggs died, a young man walked through the narrow door between the phone repair shop (still closed, the shutters down, the sign dark) and the Chinese medicine store (open, smelling of dried herbs and ginseng), and entered the Lantern Hostel.

---

His name was Oliver. Oliver Price. British. Twenty-four. From Croydon, which he described as "South London" because South London sounded better than Croydon, the same way "digital nomad" sounded better than "unemployed" and "gap year" sounded better than "running away."

He had arrived that morning on an AirAsia flight from Bangkok, fleeing the slow realisation that the money was running out and the thing he'd come to find -- "myself" or "perspective" or "the real world" -- remained unfound and the looking was becoming indistinguishable from the avoidance of everything he'd left behind: a job, a relationship, a flat, a life that had ceased to feel like a life.

He was tall, thin, pink-skinned, wearing a T-shirt from a hostel in Chiang Mai and carrying a battered Osprey covered in patches.

He rang the bell.

Mei Ling appeared. Mei Ling looked at Oliver the way Mei Ling looked at every new guest -- with the practised assessment of a receptionist who had checked in thousands of young travellers and had developed, over those thousands of check-ins, an instinct for categorisation. She categorised Oliver in approximately four seconds: British, broke, solo, between things. The category was the most common category. The category was the hostel's primary demographic. The category was Connor.

"Checking in?" Mei Ling said.

"Yeah. I booked online. Oliver Price."

Mei Ling consulted the screen. The booking system was the same booking system that had processed Connor's reservation six weeks and forty-nine days earlier. The system was digital. The system did not remember Connor. The system remembered data -- names, dates, bed assignments, payment methods -- and the data was stored in a database on a server in Singapore and the server did not know that one of the names in the database was the name of a dead man and the bed assignment attached to that name was the bed on which the dead man had slept.

"Passport, please."

Oliver handed over his passport. British. Issued in London. The photograph showed a younger, cleaner Oliver -- the photograph taken in a booth at Croydon station eighteen months ago, the face the face of a man who had not yet been to Southeast Asia and had not yet lost the girlfriend and the job and the flat. The face was recognisable but altered, the way all passport photographs became altered by the time they were used for the purpose for which they were taken, the face a historical document, a record of who the holder had been when the document was issued, not who the holder was now.

Mei Ling photocopied the passport. She entered the information into the system. She assigned a bed.

"Bed 7, Dorm 3. Second floor, end of the corridor, bottom bunk on the left."

The bed number arrived in the air between them and settled. Mei Ling did not flinch. Mei Ling had assigned Bed 7 fourteen times since the hostel reopened. Fourteen guests in six weeks, the turnover rate the standard turnover rate for a budget hostel in a major tourist city, two to four nights per guest, the guests arriving and departing and the bed receiving and releasing bodies with the regularity of a system that was designed for exactly this -- the temporary housing of transient people, the provision of a surface on which to sleep for a price that was the price of a meal in a mid-range restaurant, the transaction so minor and so routine that the assignment of the specific bed on which a man had slept before being murdered was, to the system, unremarkable.

"WiFi password's on the board," Mei Ling said. "Breakfast is seven to ten. Kitchen's communal. Quiet after eleven. You'll need your own padlock for the locker."

"Cheers."

Oliver took the keycard. He climbed the staircase. The staircase was narrow. The walls were covered in stickers. The stickers were the same stickers, minus the handful that had peeled off and plus the handful that new guests had added in the six weeks since the hostel had reopened. A new sticker: a rainbow-coloured oval that said KHAOSAN ROAD SURVIVOR. Another: a small square with a QR code that, if scanned, led to the Instagram account of a Swedish backpacker who was attempting to visit every country in the world and was currently at number forty-seven and whose account had six thousand followers and whose life was, like Connor's life had been, curated for an audience that was smaller than the curation effort warranted.

The third step squeaked.

Oliver noticed the squeak. He noticed it the way every guest noticed it -- a brief sensory registration, a filing of the information under "hostel character," a forgetting that began immediately and would be complete by the third ascent. The squeak was the building's voice and the voice said the same thing it always said, which was *I am here, I am old, I have been climbed by thousands of feet and I will be climbed by thousands more and the climbing is my purpose and my wear.*

Second floor. Corridor. Dorm 3.

The room was the room. Eight bunks, ceiling fan, air well. Five beds claimed by the evidence of absent people: backpacks, clothing, a novel, a phone charger. Bed 7 was empty, the mattress bare except for the folded sheet and towel.

Oliver sat on the mattress. He heard voices from the air well -- laughter, ease -- and smelled cooking from the ground floor. Mama Siti's kitchen, the eternal kitchen.

He lay back and closed his eyes. The flight from Bangkok had been early. He was tired. He slept.

The ceiling fan turned above him. And in the bed frame beneath his sleeping body, the letters were still there. LENA. Four letters scratched into dark wood. And below LENA, the other names -- TOM, JULIE, HANS -- the names of people who had slept here and left and survived and forgotten.

Connor's name was not there. But the bed that Connor had slept in was the bed that Oliver was sleeping in, and the continuity was the continuity of the system -- the system that produced young travellers and cheap hostels and the intersection of the two, and the occasional, inevitable interruption of the flow by violence or the law.

---

Oliver came downstairs at seven in the evening.

The common room was occupied. Three guests on the vinyl couch, watching CNN on the wall-mounted television -- the news cycle that was, as always, a rotation of crises and recoveries and the perpetual middle-distance of geopolitics that was the soundtrack of hostel common rooms worldwide. Two guests at the communal table, laptops open, the blue glow of screens reflecting off their faces, the digital nomads or the pretenders to digital nomadism, the people who sat in hostels with laptops and called it work and called themselves location-independent and were, in their way, performing the same ritual that Connor had performed at the same table six weeks ago.

Mama Siti was in the kitchen. The kitchen was warm. The kitchen smelled of onion and garlic and the particular, complex fragrance of sambal being cooked -- the chilli paste that was the base of half of Malay cuisine, the paste that Mama Siti made fresh every morning and that was, by evening, reduced to the remnants that clung to the pot and perfumed the air.

Oliver entered the common room and stood for a moment in the doorway, performing the social assessment that every solo traveller performed when entering a communal space: who is here, who looks approachable, who is too absorbed to disturb, where is the entry point to conversation. The assessment was unconscious, practised, the survival skill of a person who had been travelling alone for six months and had learned that the difference between loneliness and companionship was the willingness to walk into a room of strangers and say something.

He said something. "Anyone know where's good to eat around here?"

The question was the universal hostel opener -- the question that was not really about food but about connection, the question that said *I am here, I am new, I am available for the temporary friendship that this building facilitates.* The question was answered by one of the laptop users -- a Dutch woman, twenties, who recommended a hawker stall on Jalan Alor without looking up from her screen, the recommendation delivered with the practised efficiency of a person who had answered the same question from the same type of person in the same type of building in the same type of city dozens of times.

Oliver nodded. He started toward the door.

"Actually, mate, I was just heading out. I know a brilliant spot if you want company."

The voice came from behind him. Oliver turned.

The man was sitting in a chair by the window, a chair that Oliver had not registered because the man had been still, the stillness of a person who had been waiting, although waiting was not the word -- the word was *watching*, the passive, patient observation of the common room's traffic, the watching of a person who was looking for something and had just found it.

The man was Malaysian. Young -- late twenties, maybe early thirties. He was handsome in the way that charming people were handsome, which was to say that the handsomeness was not purely physical but was a combination of features and expression and the animation of the face that came from an intelligence that manifested as social ease. He wore a clean collared shirt, rolled at the sleeves, and dark jeans and leather shoes that were slightly too nice for a hostel common room. He had a beer in his hand -- a Tiger beer, the green bottle sweating condensation in the humid air.

He was not Felix. Felix was in Cambodia. Felix was operating out of a hostel in Phnom Penh, a city with cheaper rents and looser enforcement and the restless, accelerating energy of a Southeast Asian city that was experiencing the kind of growth that attracted both investment and exploitation, the growth that created opportunities for the legitimate and the illegitimate alike. Felix was in Cambodia and Felix was not coming back and Felix's warrant was circulating through the databases and the warrant would find him or it would not and the finding or the not-finding was the system's business, the slow, procedural pursuit that was the legal system's version of a chase, the chase measured not in kilometres but in documents.

This man was not Felix. This man was someone else. This man was the system's next iteration, the pattern's next expression, the proof that the pattern was not dependent on Felix, was not the product of a single charming German but was the product of conditions -- the conditions of a hostel in a city in a country where drugs moved through bodies and the bodies were recruited from the common rooms of buildings like this one by people like this one, the people who were charming and local and knew the city and knew the opportunities and knew the targets.

"I'm Riz," the man said. He extended his hand. The handshake was firm, warm, the handshake of a person who had been trained in the social protocols that made strangers comfortable, the handshake that was the first gesture of a relationship that would develop according to a pattern that was not Riz's invention but the pattern's invention, the pattern reproducing itself through a new operator the way a franchise reproduced itself through new locations, the product the same, the branding different, the system identical.

"Oliver," Oliver said.

"British?"

"Yeah. London. Well, Croydon. South London."

Riz smiled. The smile was the smile of a person who found the other person's answer charming, who found the distinction between Croydon and South London amusing and endearing, who found Oliver -- broke, alone, between things, newly arrived -- to be exactly the kind of person who was worth smiling at, worth buying a beer for, worth investing an evening in.

"First time in KL?"

"Yeah. Just got in from Bangkok."

"Bangkok." Riz nodded, the nod of a person who understood Bangkok and its particular intensity, the nod of a person who had context for Oliver's arrival and could place it in the narrative of a young traveller moving through Southeast Asia. "Bangkok's intense. KL's different. KL's... easier. More relaxed. You'll like it."

"I hope so."

"Come on, I'll take you to a hawker centre. The real one, not the tourist one. My treat."

The offer was the offer. The offer was a beer and a meal and the company of a local who knew the city and who was generous and charming and who had appeared at exactly the moment when Oliver needed exactly what this man was offering -- connection, guidance, the antidote to the loneliness that had followed him from Croydon to Bangkok to KL.

Oliver hesitated. The hesitation was brief -- approximately two seconds, the duration of a thought that did not fully form, the thought that was less a thought than an instinct, the instinct that something about this situation was familiar in a way that Oliver could not place because Oliver had not been in this situation before but the situation had existed before, the situation was a pattern, and patterns generated a frequency that some people could detect and some people could not, and Oliver was in the category of people who could detect the frequency but could not interpret it, who felt the vibration without identifying the source.

The hesitation passed. The two seconds elapsed. The thought -- or the instinct, or the vibration -- dissolved, the way all such subtle warnings dissolved when they were not reinforced by knowledge, by context, by the specific information that would have converted the instinct into a decision. The information that would have converted the instinct into a decision was: a man named Connor Briggs sat in this common room six weeks ago and a man named Felix Decker made the same offer and the offer led to envelopes and the envelopes led to packages and the packages led to a suitcase and the suitcase led to a checkpoint and the checkpoint led to a cell and the cell led to a towel and the towel led to death. This information existed. This information was in police files and newspaper archives and Tomoko's Instagram and the memories of Priya and Jake and Mei Ling and Mama Siti and Ahmad. This information was everywhere except in Oliver's head, and the absence of the information in Oliver's head was the absence that made the pattern possible, the gap in knowledge that was the gap through which the pattern moved, the ignorance that was not stupidity but was the human condition of not knowing what you did not know.

"Yeah, alright," Oliver said. "Sounds good."

Riz bought Oliver a beer from the cooler behind reception. Tiger, the same green bottle, RM8. Mei Ling processed the sale. Mei Ling looked at Riz. Mei Ling looked at Oliver. Mei Ling looked at the beer.

Mei Ling's expression did not change. The professional composure held.

But behind it, Mei Ling felt the recognition. Not the man. The sequence. New guest. Charming local. Beer. The offer. She had watched this sequence before. She knew how it ended.

Mei Ling handed the beer to Oliver. "Enjoy," she said.

The word was the word of a receptionist. The word was also a prayer. The word was the hope that Oliver would enjoy his beer and his evening and his stay at the Lantern Hostel and would leave alive and would never know how close he was, in this moment, to the beginning of a sequence that had killed the man who had slept in his bed six weeks ago.

Oliver and Riz left through the front door. The bell rang. The door closed. The common room resumed its evening rhythm -- the CNN broadcast, the laptop screens, the slow accumulation of guests returning from the day and gathering in the shared space that was the hostel's social heart.

---

Mama Siti saw.

She was in the kitchen. She was always in the kitchen. She observed through the window between kitchen and common room -- the frame through which the hostel's daily drama played, the cast rotating but the plot unchanged.

She saw Oliver. She saw the beer. She saw Riz. She saw the offer. She saw the acceptance. She saw the departure.

Her face did not change. Guests described it as "inscrutable," which was the word tourists used for a face they could not read. The face was not inscrutable. The face was the face of a woman watching the first scene of a story she had seen before.

She turned from the window. She went to the rice cooker. The rice cooker was plugged in. The rice was soaking -- the basmati that she used for nasi lemak, the rice washed three times and soaked for two hours in coconut milk and pandan leaf, the preparation that was the ritual's beginning, the first step in the process that would produce, by 6 AM the next morning, the nasi lemak that would be placed on the counter in the kitchen.

She checked the sambal. The sambal was in the pot on the stove, reduced and resting, the chilli paste that was the heart of the dish, the paste that had been cooked since early morning and was now at the stage of its preparation where it needed only to cool and be stored and be reheated tomorrow. The sambal was ready. The anchovies were fried. The peanuts were roasted. The eggs were boiled.

The nasi lemak would be ready in the morning. The plate would be set at the counter. The banana leaf would be laid out. The rice would be mounded. The sambal would be spooned. The anchovies would be scattered. The peanuts would be placed. The egg would be halved and positioned, the yolk bright against the white, the white bright against the green of the banana leaf.

The plate would be there. The plate would be the question. The question was the question that Mama Siti asked every morning, the question that was not spoken but was contained in the plate, in the food, in the act of preparation, the question that was:

*If you come to eat, I will know you are still alive.*

The question would be asked of Oliver, as it had been asked of Connor, as it had been asked of every guest who had slept in the hostel during the seventeen years that Mama Siti had cooked in its kitchen. The question was not a magic spell. The question was not a protection. The question was a woman's way of counting the living, of taking attendance, of performing the daily census that was the cook's privilege and the cook's burden -- the burden of knowing that the absence of a person at breakfast was the absence that might mean departure or might mean death, and the difference between the two was the difference between a guest who had checked out and a guest who had been checked out, and the checking out was sometimes voluntary and sometimes was not.

Mama Siti covered the sambal pot. She wiped the counter. She removed her apron and folded it and placed it on the hook by the door. She turned off the kitchen light.

She walked through the common room. The guests did not notice her. The cook was part of the building's infrastructure, invisible in the way that all service workers were invisible to the people they served.

She walked to the front door. She paused. She looked back at the common room. The room was warm. The red lanterns glowed. The ceiling fans turned. The guests sat and talked and typed and lived.

Somewhere in the city, a young British man was eating hawker food with a charming local man who had bought him a beer and who was asking about his plans and who was saying, perhaps at this very moment, the words that were the words: *I might know a way to make some easy money.*

The words would be spoken. Or the words would not be spoken -- not tonight, maybe, but tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after. The words would be spoken because the words were the pattern's dialogue, the script that the system produced, and the system did not require Felix to produce the script. The system required only the conditions -- the lonely foreigner, the financial pressure, the charming stranger, the offer -- and the conditions were met, and the conditions were always met, and the meeting of the conditions was the pattern's activation, the system's ignition, the beginning of the sequence that began with a beer and ended, sometimes, with a cell.

Mama Siti did not know if the sequence would complete. She did not know if Oliver would accept the offer, if Oliver would carry the envelope, if Oliver would escalate from envelope to package to backpack to suitcase. She did not know because the future was the future and the future was unknowable and the knowing of the future was not her function. Her function was the kitchen. Her function was the nasi lemak. Her function was the plate on the counter and the question in the plate and the counting of the living.

She stepped into the street. Petaling Street was busy with the evening crowd -- the tourists and the locals and the hawkers and the traffic, the sensory tumult of a city that did not slow down at night but merely changed its register, the daytime commerce replaced by the nighttime commerce, the market stalls replaced by the food stalls, the shoppers replaced by the diners.

She walked toward the LRT station. Her steps were slow. Her steps were the steps of a woman who had been walking this street for longer than the hostel had existed, who had been present in this neighbourhood since before the building was a hostel, since before it was an abandoned ruin, since before it was a brothel and a gambling den and a Japanese administrative office. Her steps were the steps of continuity, the human thread that connected the building's iterations, the woman who had cooked in the kitchen under every version of the building's identity and who would cook in the kitchen under the next version, whatever the next version was.

The nasi lemak would be ready in the morning.

The plate would be set at the counter.

The question would be asked.

And the answer -- the answer that was not words but was the act of arriving, the act of sitting, the act of eating, the act of being present at breakfast in a body that was alive and hungry and capable of the simple, essential, irreducible act of consuming food -- the answer would be given or it would not, and the giving or the not-giving would tell Mama Siti what she needed to know, which was the only thing she had ever needed to know, which was: *are you still here? Are you still alive? Did you survive the night?*

The night would tell.

The night always told.

---

In the common room, the television showed the news. The news was not about Connor Briggs. The news was about a trade deal and a typhoon and a football match and the rotation of events that was the news cycle's content, the cycle that had absorbed Connor's story and processed it and expelled it and moved on to the next story and the next, the cycle that was the mechanism by which the world converted events into history and history into the past and the past into the material from which the future was built.

The common room was warm. The lanterns glowed. The ceiling fans turned.

Upstairs, in Dorm 3, Bed 7 was empty. The mattress held the impression of Oliver's body -- the slight depression, the warmth that was fading, the evidence of recent occupation that would be gone by morning. The bed waited. The bed was patient. The bed had the patience of a thing that had no consciousness and therefore no impatience, a thing that existed in the permanent present tense of objects, the tense in which there was no waiting because there was no expectation of what came next.

The ceiling fan turned above the bed.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

The sound was the building's heartbeat. The sound was the metronome of the system. The sound measured nothing and the sound measured everything -- the interval between arrivals, the interval between departures, the interval between the filling and the emptying of a bed that had been filled and emptied hundreds of times and would be filled and emptied hundreds of times more.

The pattern was not Felix. The pattern was the system. The system was not the network. The system was the world. The world was the world, and the world produced the conditions, and the conditions produced the pattern, and the pattern produced the deaths, and the deaths were absorbed by the building and the building continued and the pattern continued and the world continued.

The ceiling fan turned.

The lanterns glowed.

The night fell on Kuala Lumpur the way night fell on all cities -- without discrimination, without mercy, without awareness of what the darkness concealed, which was everything: the charming strangers and the lonely travellers and the hawker stalls and the police stations and the cells and the towels and the law that applied to everyone and the law that spared no one and the law that was the law and the law did not care and the law did not forgive and the law was waiting, the law was always waiting, for the next one.

*End of Chapter 48*
# Chapter 49: @HostelReaper

Tomoko found the account on a Wednesday, three months after Connor's death.

She found it the way all digital investigations began -- not with a search but with a recognition. A piece of information encountered casually, peripherally, that was not noise but signal, not random but patterned. The recognition arrived at 2:17 AM in Osaka, where Tomoko had returned after three months of travel -- KL to Bangkok to Hanoi to Hong Kong and back to Japan.

She was sitting on the floor of her room in Tennoji -- the desk she never used, the floor she always used, the laptop open in front of her like a viewfinder into the digital residue of Connor Briggs's death.

She had been looking for three months. The looking had begun on the day after the death, when she had received Priya's message -- the WhatsApp message that had arrived while Tomoko was in the hostel's common room, the message that said *Connor is dead, murdered in custody, the letter went to Ahmad, the photographs, use them, tell the truth* -- and the message had activated in Tomoko the thing that was her function, which was the documentation of truth, the recording of the thing that had happened, the translation of event into image and image into story and story into public record.

Her photographs had been published. The Star had run them first -- the photographs of Felix Decker in the hostel's common room, the photographs of Felix and Wei at the phone repair shop, the photographs of Felix's late-night exchanges on the rooftop, the photographs that were the visual evidence of a trafficking operation that had been conducted in plain sight, in a building full of witnesses, by a man who was charming enough to make the witnesses look elsewhere. The Star had run the photographs and the international wire services had picked them up and the photographs had appeared in The Guardian and The Sydney Morning Herald and The Asahi Shimbun and on websites and social media accounts and in the briefing documents of the parliamentary committee that was reviewing the circumstances of Connor Briggs's death.

The photographs were her contribution. The photographs were the thing she could do. But the photographs were not enough -- the photographs documented the trafficking operation but they did not explain the death, did not explain the system, did not explain the pattern that connected Connor's death to the deaths that had come before and the deaths that would come after. The photographs were evidence but they were not understanding. Understanding required investigation, required research, required the kind of sustained, obsessive, sleepless inquiry that Tomoko was now conducting at 2:17 AM on the floor of her room in Osaka with a laptop and a pot of green tea and the focused, sleepless energy of a person who had found a thread and was pulling it.

The thread was @HostelReaper.

She had first encountered the account on the day of Connor's death -- the Instagram post that had appeared at 4:17 PM Malaysian time, the photograph of the empty cell at Dang Wangi, the caption that named Connor and his age and his nationality and the day of his death, the hashtags: #LocalLaw #101Ways #MandatoryDeath #TheRulesApply. She had seen the post because she had been searching Instagram for posts tagged with #LanternHostel and #ConnorBriggs, the search that journalists conducted in the immediate aftermath of a newsworthy death, the search for the digital traces of the event, the social media footprint that accompanied every death in the modern world.

The @HostelReaper post had been one of many posts in the search results. She had noted it, screenshotted it, filed it. She had not investigated further -- the immediate priority was the photographs, the story, the evidence that needed to be delivered to The Star and to Ahmad's investigation.

But the post had stayed with her. The post had occupied a space in her mind that was reserved for the things that did not fit, the anomalies, the pieces of information that could not be explained by the available context. The post did not fit because the post had been made at 4:17 PM on Saturday -- approximately fourteen hours after the body was found, before the hostel had been officially notified, before the Australian High Commission had contacted the family, before any media outlet had reported the death. The post contained information that should not have been available to anyone outside the investigation: Connor's name, his age, his nationality, the specific cell number, the date of death.

The post knew things it should not have known.

This was the thread. This was the thing that Tomoko had been pulling for three months, the thread that had led her from the single post about Connor to the account's other posts, and from the other posts to the other deaths, and from the other deaths to the pattern that connected them, the pattern that was @HostelReaper's archive, the digital record of a series of deaths in hostels across the world that the account had documented with the same specificity and the same impossible foreknowledge.

Twelve posts. Twelve deaths. Eleven countries. Three years.

Tomoko had a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was the journalist's tool -- the organized, systematic record of the data she had collected, the data arranged in columns: Post Number, Date, Location, Victim Name, Age, Nationality, Cause of Death, Hostel Name, Time Between Death and Post, Source of Death Confirmation.

She read the spreadsheet. She read it the way she read all data -- not as numbers but as stories, each row a life, each cell a fact, each fact a fragment of a narrative that, when assembled with the other facts, produced a picture that was both clear and incomprehensible.

Post 1. 22 March, three years ago. Luang Prabang, Laos. Emma Whitfield. 21. British. Drowned in the Mekong River after falling from a hostel's riverside deck. Gecko Guesthouse. The post appeared six hours after the drowning, eight hours before the local newspaper reported it. The caption: *Emma Whitfield. 21. UK. Day 12. Checked out. #101Ways #TheRiverKnows.*

Post 2. 7 June, three years ago. Bogota, Colombia. Marcus Chen. 23. Canadian. Fell from the fourth floor of a hostel in La Candelaria. The police report said accidental. The hostel's security camera showed Marcus alone on the balcony at 3 AM. The post appeared four hours after the fall, twelve hours before the Canadian embassy was notified. The caption: *Marcus Chen. 23. Canada. Day 8. Checked out. #101Ways #TheHeightOfIt.*

Post 3. 14 September, three years ago. Kathmandu, Nepal. Ingrid Larsson. 26. Swedish. Food poisoning. Died in her dorm room. The hostel staff found her in the morning. The post appeared two hours after the body was discovered. Two hours. The caption: *Ingrid Larsson. 26. Sweden. Day 31. Checked out. #101Ways #LastSupper.*

The spreadsheet continued. Post 4: Cape Town, South Africa. Post 5: Hanoi, Vietnam. Post 6: Cartagena, Colombia. Post 7: Siem Reap, Cambodia. Post 8: Nairobi, Kenya. Post 9: Quito, Ecuador. Post 10: Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Post 11: Johor Bahru, Malaysia -- Daniel Park, the Korean-American, the death that Wei had described in his testimony, the death that was the same as Connor's, the death in custody, the protocol.

Post 12. Connor Briggs. KL. The Lantern Hostel. The post that had started Tomoko's investigation.

Twelve deaths. Eleven countries. Three years. Every post matched a real death. Every post appeared before the death was publicly reported. Every post contained specific, verifiable details -- names, ages, nationalities, the number of days the victim had been at the hostel. Every post used the same hashtag: #101Ways. Every post used the same sign-off: *Checked out.*

Tomoko had verified each death. The verification had taken three months -- three months of emails to police departments and embassies and local newspapers and the families of the dead, the families who had, in most cases, never heard of @HostelReaper and who responded to Tomoko's inquiries with the particular mixture of confusion and grief that was the response of people who had lost a child to a foreign country and were now being asked about an Instagram account that had documented the loss before they had been notified of it. The verification was painful. The verification required Tomoko to contact people who were still grieving and to ask them questions that reopened wounds that had not closed. The verification was the cost of the investigation, and the cost was borne by the families, and the families bore it because the families wanted answers and the answers were not available from the police or the embassies or the governments that had presided over their children's deaths.

Every death was real. Every post was accurate. The account knew.

The question was: how?

---

Tomoko wrote the article in three days.

The article was titled: "The Account That Knows When Backpackers Die." Eight thousand words. An investigation that began with a single Instagram post about a death in KL and expanded outward to encompass twelve deaths in eleven countries over three years.

The @HostelReaper Instagram account had no profile picture. Bio: *101 Ways. Check-out is mandatory.* Following zero accounts. 147 followers -- true-crime enthusiasts, travel bloggers, and two journalists tracking the same digital traces Tomoko was tracking.

The account had been created three years and four months ago. The first post -- Emma Whitfield, Luang Prabang -- appeared three days after creation. The posting schedule followed the deaths.

Tomoko had attempted to identify the account's operator. The attempt had involved three avenues of investigation, each of which had reached a dead end.

Avenue one: Instagram's data. Tomoko had submitted a formal request to Meta's press office for information about the @HostelReaper account -- the email address used to register the account, the IP addresses from which the account had been accessed, the device identifiers associated with the account's activity. Meta had responded with a form letter stating that the company could not release user data without a valid legal order from a law enforcement agency. Tomoko had contacted Ahmad, who had contacted Interpol, who had submitted a request to Meta through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process. The request was pending. The request had been pending for six weeks. The request would likely be pending for several more months, the speed of international legal cooperation being the speed of international legal cooperation, which was the speed of bureaucracy multiplied by the number of jurisdictions involved.

Avenue two: digital forensics. Tomoko had consulted a cybersecurity researcher at Osaka University, a colleague who specialised in social media analysis. The researcher had examined the account's posts for metadata -- the digital information embedded in photographs, the EXIF data that could reveal the camera model, the GPS coordinates, the time and date of the photograph. The metadata had been stripped. Every photograph posted by @HostelReaper had been processed through a metadata-removal tool before being uploaded, the processing the mark of a person who understood digital forensics and who had taken precautions against precisely the kind of analysis that Tomoko's colleague was attempting. The photographs were clean. The photographs contained no information beyond the visual content.

Avenue three: the content itself. Tomoko had analysed the photographs and the captions for patterns that might reveal the poster's identity, location, or methodology. The analysis had produced several observations but no conclusions.

Observation one: the photographs were taken from inside the hostels. The photographs showed interiors -- dorm rooms, common rooms, bathrooms, corridors. The photographs were not taken from public spaces or external vantage points. The photographer had been inside the buildings. This meant that the photographer was either a guest, a staff member, or had access to the buildings through some other means.

Observation two: the photographs of the death locations were taken after the deaths but before the areas were secured by police. The photograph of Connor's cell, for example, showed the empty cell with the fluorescent light on and the word REAPER scratched into the bench. The photograph was taken after Connor's body had been removed but before the forensic team had processed the scene. This meant the photographer had access to the cell between the removal of the body and the securing of the scene -- a window of approximately two hours, according to Ahmad's timeline of the investigation.

Observation three: the captions contained information that was not publicly available at the time of posting. The number of days the victim had been at the hostel, for example, was not information that would be available to a casual observer or a person monitoring news reports. This information was available to hostel staff (who would know the check-in date), to police (who would obtain it during the investigation), or to someone who had been observing the victim during their stay.

Observation four: the hashtag #101Ways appeared in every post. The number 101 was not random. The number appeared to be a count -- or a target. If @HostelReaper was documenting deaths in hostels, and if the number 101 was a target, then the account was documenting its way toward a goal, and Connor Briggs was a data point, and each death was a data point, and the data points were accumulating toward a number that was, perhaps, a completion, an endpoint, a final checkout.

But this was speculation. The article did not speculate. The article presented the observations and left the conclusions to the reader, the reader who would draw the conclusions that the evidence supported and the conclusions that the evidence did not support and the conclusions that existed in the space between evidence and imagination, the space that was the territory of mystery, the territory that @HostelReaper occupied.

The article was published in *The Bureau of Investigative Journalism*. Shared 47,000 times in its first week. Picked up by the BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, news outlets in each of the eleven countries where the deaths had occurred.

The article did not solve the mystery. The article deepened it -- placing a single, strange Instagram account in the context of twelve real deaths, converting what might have been a macabre hoax into something that demanded explanation. The account did not explain itself. The account simply posted. The account simply said *I know* and offered no account of how it knew.

---

The @HostelReaper account posted one final photograph related to Connor's death.

The photograph appeared three days after Tomoko's article was published. The photograph was the thirteenth post. The photograph showed a bathroom stall.

The bathroom stall was in the Lantern Hostel, second floor, the bathroom adjacent to Dorm 3. The stall was the stall that guests used daily -- the tile walls, the squat toilet, the plastic cistern with the flush that required three attempts, the drain in the floor that was perpetually damp. The stall was unremarkable in every way except one.

On the wall, at eye level for a person sitting on the toilet, words were written in black marker. The handwriting was neat, small, controlled -- not the scrawl of a drunk or the rushed tagging of a vandal but the deliberate, careful letters of a person who had taken the time to write legibly, who had wanted the words to be read, who had treated the wall of a bathroom stall in a Chinatown hostel with the same attention that a calligrapher treated rice paper.

The words were: @HostelReaper was here. Check-out is mandatory.

Below the words, a small drawing -- a reaper figure, the cloaked skeletal figure that was the Western iconography of death, the figure rendered in miniature with a level of detail that was incongruous with the medium, the figure drawn with the care of an illustration rather than the haste of graffiti.

The photograph showed the graffiti in sharp focus. The tile wall behind it was the pale green of Southeast Asian bathrooms, the colour that was the colour of institutions and public spaces and the shared facilities of budget accommodation. The lighting was the lighting of a bathroom -- fluorescent, flat, the light that made everything look clinical and slightly unwell.

The caption was: *#LocalLaw. Filed. // Next: somewhere the river runs through the rooms. #BookOfTheNile. Check-out is mandatory. Always.*

The post had one additional element that the previous posts had not included. Below the caption, in the space where Instagram allowed additional text, a line: *"Orang yang tak tahu undang-undang, undang-undang tak tahu dia."*

Mama Siti's proverb. The proverb she had told Connor on his seventh day at the hostel. The proverb that meant "he who doesn't know the law, the law doesn't know him." The proverb that Connor had ignored and that was now, three months after his death, inscribed in the digital record of his death by an account that should not have known the proverb was spoken, that should not have known the proverb existed in the context of Connor's story, because the proverb had been spoken in a kitchen, in a private conversation, between an old woman and a young man who was dead.

Tomoko saw the post. She saw it at 11:42 PM, Osaka time, in her room, on her phone, the phone resting on the floor beside the futon on which she was not sleeping because sleep was the thing that eluded her when the investigation was active, the investigation a kind of insomnia, the pursuit of the answer the thing that kept the mind turning like the ceiling fans at the Lantern Hostel, turning and turning without arriving.

She looked at the photograph. She looked at the caption.

*#LocalLaw. Filed.*

The words were a close. The words were the ending of a chapter -- not a chapter of a book but the chapter that was Connor's story, the iteration of the @HostelReaper archive that was designated #LocalLaw, the hashtag that had appeared in every post about Connor, the hashtag that was the account's filing system, the taxonomy of death.

*Next: somewhere the river runs through the rooms. #BookOfTheNile.*

The words were an opening. The words were the beginning of the next chapter, the next story, the next death. The Nile. Egypt, perhaps. Or Sudan. Or Uganda. Or any of the eleven countries through which the Nile flowed. The words were a prediction -- or an announcement, or a promise, or a threat. The words said: *I am not finished. There will be another one. The account will continue. The documentation will continue. The deaths will continue.*

Tomoko screenshotted the post. She added it to the spreadsheet. She updated the article with an addendum. She sent the addendum to the Bureau's editor with a note: *New post. The account is still active. The account is moving to a new location. The next death is being anticipated.*

She sat in her room. The room was small. The room was quiet. Three months. Twelve deaths. Eleven countries. An account that knew things before the knowing was possible. She stared at the dark screen of the laptop the way she stared through a viewfinder -- waiting for the image to resolve.

The mystery was the point. Tomoko understood this. As a journalist, she wanted answers -- she wanted the name behind the account, the method of the knowledge, the explanation that would convert the mystery into a fact and the fact into a story and the story into a publication that would satisfy the reader's need for resolution. But the mystery resisted resolution. The mystery was designed to resist resolution -- the metadata stripped, the identity hidden, the account's operation conducted with a level of security that suggested not amateur obsession but professional infrastructure, not a person with a hobby but a system with a function.

The function was documentation. The function was the recording of deaths that the world would otherwise forget, the deaths that occurred in hostels and guesthouses and budget lodges in countries where young travellers went to find themselves and sometimes found, instead, the thing that waited at the end of every journey, the thing that was not enlightenment or adventure or love but was the other thing, the final thing, the thing that @HostelReaper called checkout.

Who was @HostelReaper?

Tomoko had theories. She did not publish them because theories were not facts and she was a journalist and journalists published facts. But in her room in Osaka, at midnight, with the green tea cold and the laptop's screen the only light, she allowed herself the theories, the speculations, the possibilities that existed in the space between what she knew and what she did not.

Theory one: @HostelReaper was a person. A single person. A traveller, perhaps, who moved through the hostel circuit the way that all travellers moved through the hostel circuit, staying in dorms, eating communal breakfasts, climbing narrow staircases. A person who was present at the hostels where the deaths occurred, who witnessed the deaths or their immediate aftermath, who photographed the locations and posted the photographs with the information they had gathered during their stay. This theory explained the interior photographs and the specific knowledge. This theory did not explain the timing -- the posts appearing before the deaths were publicly reported, the posts appearing in hostels in eleven different countries over three years, the logistical impossibility of a single person being present at twelve deaths in eleven countries unless the person knew, in advance, where the deaths would occur.

Theory two: @HostelReaper was a network. A group of people, distributed across the hostel circuit, each person responsible for a region or a city, the network coordinating through the shared Instagram account. This theory explained the geographic distribution and the timing. This theory did not explain the consistency -- the identical voice, the identical formatting, the identical aesthetic of the photographs, the uniformity suggesting a single sensibility rather than a collective.

Theory three: @HostelReaper was connected to the deaths. Not a witness but a participant. Not a documenter but an architect. The account did not report deaths -- the account predicted them, or caused them, or was part of a system that caused them. The darkest theory. The 2 AM theory. The one she returned to the way her fingers returned to a scar -- not wanting to touch it, touching it anyway. Behind the data, a door. Behind the door, something she was not sure she wanted to photograph. This theory explained everything -- the timing, the specificity, the impossible foreknowledge. This theory was also the theory that, if true, meant that @HostelReaper was not a mystery to be solved but a danger to be confronted, and the confrontation was not a journalistic task but a law enforcement task, and the law enforcement agencies of eleven countries were not yet coordinated enough to confront it.

Theory four: @HostelReaper was something else. Not a person, not a network, not a participant. Something that existed in the digital space the way a haunting existed in a physical space -- a presence felt but not seen, detectable but not identifiable. Tomoko did not believe in ghosts. But the feeling persisted: @HostelReaper was not a who but a what. Not a person but a condition.

Tomoko did not choose between the theories. Tomoko held them all, the way a good journalist held multiple hypotheses, the holding not a failure of conviction but a discipline of inquiry, the discipline that said: *I do not know, and the not-knowing is the honest position, and the honest position is the position from which the investigation proceeds.*

The investigation would proceed. Tomoko would continue. The account would continue. The deaths would continue. And the investigation and the account and the deaths would continue in their parallel tracks, the tracks intersecting at the points where the documentation met the reality and the reality met the documentation, the intersection the place where the truth lived, the truth that was not a conclusion but a process, not a destination but a direction.

---

The graffiti in the bathroom stall was there before Connor arrived. The graffiti would be there after.

This was the fact that Tomoko had confirmed through her investigation. She had contacted Mei Ling, who had confirmed that the graffiti had been noticed by a guest approximately seven months before Connor's check-in. The guest had mentioned it to Mei Ling at the reception desk: "There's some weird graffiti in the second-floor bathroom. Something about a reaper?" Mei Ling had noted it and done nothing because the hostel's walls were covered in graffiti and the removal of one piece would have required the removal of all pieces and the removal of all pieces would have required the repainting of all walls and the repainting was not in the budget and the budget was the arbiter of aesthetics in a hostel that charged RM35 per night.

The graffiti was a physical artefact -- the tangible counterpart to the digital account. The wall was real. The ink was real. The hand that had held the marker was real, and had belonged to a person who treated the writing not as vandalism but as inscription.

The graffiti was the only physical evidence of @HostelReaper's existence. The graffiti was the place where the digital and the physical met, the point of contact between the Instagram account and the real world, the proof that whatever @HostelReaper was, it was not purely digital, was not purely an online phenomenon, was not a bot or an algorithm or a piece of software but was, at some point, in some form, a physical presence in the physical world, a hand holding a marker, an eye seeing a wall, a mind deciding to write.

The graffiti remained on the wall. Hafizul, the temporary manager, had been told about it by Mei Ling after Tomoko's article was published. Hafizul had considered removing it. Hafizul had decided not to remove it because the removal might destroy evidence and the evidence was potentially relevant to the investigation and the investigation was still active and the decision to preserve or destroy evidence was not Hafizul's decision but Ahmad's decision.

Ahmad had visited the hostel to photograph the graffiti. Ahmad had stood in the bathroom stall with a camera and photographed the words and the figure on the wall, the detective performing the same function as the journalist, the documentation of the documentation, the recording of the recording, the recursive act of a system that documented everything including its own documentation.

The graffiti remained. The mark, the signal, the proof that @HostelReaper had been here. The hostel was the reaper's territory. The guests were the inventory. The checkout was the function. And the function was mandatory.

*Check-out is mandatory.*

The words on the wall. The words on the screen. The words that connected the physical building in Chinatown to the digital account on Instagram to the twelve deaths in eleven countries to the next death, wherever it would be, the death that was designated #BookOfTheNile, the death that was being anticipated or planned or predicted or simply known, known by whatever @HostelReaper was, known in the way that @HostelReaper knew, which was a way that Tomoko had not identified and might never identify and that the not-identifying was the mystery and the mystery was the point and the point was the thing that kept her awake at midnight in Osaka, the thing that kept the investigation alive, the thing that made the story not a story about a death but a story about a system, a pattern, a phenomenon that was larger than any single death and older than any single account and more persistent than any single investigation.

---

Tomoko closed her laptop.

The screen went dark. The room went dark. The darkness was the darkness of a small room in Osaka at midnight, the darkness that was populated by the shapes of familiar furniture and the red standby light of the laptop and the faint glow of the city outside the window, the permanent ambient light of a city that, like all cities, did not fully darken.

She stood. She walked to the window. She opened the curtain. The view was Tennoji -- the rooftops and the neon and the elevated train line and the distant tower of Abeno Harukas, the tallest building in Osaka, lit at night in blue and white. The view was her city, her neighbourhood, her home, the place that was the fixed point from which she travelled and to which she returned, the place that was the opposite of the hostels she documented, the place that was permanent rather than transient, the place where she slept in the same bed every night and woke in the same room every morning and the sameness was the stability that made the instability of her work possible.

She thought about the Lantern Hostel. She thought about the common room -- the vinyl couch, the abandoned novels, the television playing CNN, the ceiling fans turning. She thought about Mei Ling at the reception desk, sharp-eyed, watchful, the woman who had tried to warn Connor and had not been heard. She thought about Mama Siti in the kitchen, ancient, knowing, the woman who cooked as a form of vigil, who counted the living by counting the plates. She thought about Razak in his office, surrounded by his clippings and his pins, the collector who had become a data point in his own collection.

She thought about Connor. She thought about him not as a victim or a case or a photograph in an article but as a person -- the sun-bleached hair, the squint, the board shorts, the compass tattoo, the voice that said *she'll be right* and *relax, it's Asia* and the voice that said *I didn't know, mate, I swear I didn't know*. She thought about the gap between the two voices -- the voice of confidence and the voice of terror, the gap that was Connor's life, the gap that was the distance between the rooftop where he'd been happy and the cell where he'd died.

She thought about Oliver. She did not know Oliver's name -- she did not know that a British backpacker named Oliver Price had checked into Bed 7 six weeks after Connor's death. But she knew Oliver existed. She knew Oliver existed because Oliver was the statistical certainty, the next data point, the next young traveller who would arrive at a hostel and be broke and be lonely and be vulnerable and be approached by a charming stranger with an offer. Oliver was the pattern's next iteration. Oliver was the next one. And the next one after Oliver was the next one after Oliver, and the sequence was infinite, the sequence was the world, the sequence was the condition of a planet that produced eight billion people and a travel industry that moved them and a hospitality industry that housed them and a criminal industry that exploited them and a legal system that punished them and a social media account that documented them.

She thought about @HostelReaper. She thought about the account the way she thought about the hostels themselves -- as a container, a structure, a thing that held other things. The account held death the way the hostels held life. The account was the archive, the record, the memory that the hostels did not have. The hostels forgot their guests. The account remembered them. The hostels erased the traces -- the sheets washed, the beds remade, the names forgotten. The account preserved the traces -- the names posted, the dates recorded, the deaths documented. The account was the hostels' shadow, the dark counterpart to the bright, warm, lantern-lit spaces where young people slept and ate and fell in love and made plans and ignored warnings and carried packages and climbed staircases and heard squeaks and felt ceiling fans and did all the things that living people did in buildings that were designed for living until the buildings became, for a moment, buildings that were designed for dying.

@HostelReaper was here. @HostelReaper was always here. @HostelReaper was the thing that waited in the bathroom stall, in the Instagram feed, in the space between the building and the internet, in the gap between the physical and the digital, in the territory that the modern world had created and that no one had named, the territory where the living and the dead coexisted as data, as profiles, as posts, as the ones who were tagged and the ones who were not.

Tomoko closed the curtain. She lay on her futon. She did not sleep. She did not sleep because the investigation was not finished and the investigation would not be finished because the investigation was not the kind that finished, not the kind that arrived at a conclusion and closed a file and typed THE END. The investigation was ongoing. The investigation was the investigation of a system that was ongoing. The system did not stop. The account did not stop. The deaths did not stop. And Tomoko, lying on her futon in Osaka at midnight, did not stop, the journalist's mind the mind that did not stop, the mind that continued to process and connect and question and doubt, the mind that was the human equivalent of the ceiling fan, turning and turning in the darkness.

---

At the Lantern Hostel, past midnight, the common room was quiet. The television off, the laptop users gone, the ground floor given over to the building's own sounds. A moth circled the single bulb above the bookshelf, orbiting without landing.

Somewhere in the building, or in the internet, or in the space between the two, something watched.

The something was not definable. Not a person, not a camera, not an algorithm. The something was the condition of being observed -- the condition of a hostel in the digital age, existing simultaneously in physical space and digital space, holding bodies and holding information at the same address.

The something watched. The something waited. The waiting was for the next checkout.

---

In Osaka, Tomoko lay in the dark. In KL, the Lantern Hostel stood in the dark, its red lanterns glowing. In Hawthorn, David and Karen Briggs sat in a house that was quieter than it had ever been. In Kajang, Nurul slept in a cell. In Sungai Buloh, Wei stared at a ceiling. In London, Priya wrote a letter to a dead man that she would never send. In Langkawi, Jake scrolled through Instagram and saw a photograph and stopped scrolling and stared at his phone and put his phone down and picked it up and looked again and put it down and did not look again. In Phnom Penh, Felix Decker sat in a hostel's common room and watched a young Canadian woman walk through the door and assessed her the way he assessed everyone -- the backpack, the tan, the budget, the loneliness -- and smiled.

And in the bathroom stall on the second floor of the Lantern Hostel, the graffiti remained.

@HostelReaper was here. Check-out is mandatory.

The words were on the wall. The words were in the account. The words were in the investigation and the article and the spreadsheet and the police file and the parliamentary inquiry and the family's grief and the journalist's insomnia and the building's atmosphere and the bed's frame and the city's night.

The words were everywhere and the words were nowhere and the words said: *this is not one story, this is one story told many times, the same story in different bodies in different buildings in different cities.*

One hundred and one ways.

And the counting continued.

The ceiling fans turned.

The lanterns glowed.

The building breathed.

And somewhere -- in a room, in a server, in the space between the physical and the digital -- something watched. Something waited for the next checkout.

The next checkout was coming.

The next checkout was always coming.

Check-out is mandatory.

*End of Chapter 49*
# Chapter 50: Bed 7

Three months after Connor Briggs died in a cell at Dang Wangi, a young woman from New Zealand arrived at the Lantern Hostel on Petaling Street with a backpack and a ukulele and the conviction that Southeast Asia was going to change her life.

Her name was Sophie. She was twenty-three. She had arrived in Kuala Lumpur that morning on an AirAsia flight from Phnom Penh -- the same route that Felix Decker had taken three months earlier in the opposite direction, the airlines indifferent to the moral content of their passengers' itineraries.

She walked from Pasar Seni to Petaling Street, the same twelve minutes it had taken Connor Briggs, filming everything -- the motorcycles threading through traffic, the market vendors, the char kway teow sizzling on a corner stall, the red lanterns between buildings. Her phone was up, the lens always open, content for the 1,800 followers of @SophieGoesPlaces who expected bright, aspirational documentation of a young woman living her best life in places that were photogenic and affordable and safely exotic.

She reached the Lantern Hostel at twelve thirty. The building looked exactly as it had looked for ninety-seven years -- the pre-war shophouse facade, the narrow entrance, the red lanterns hanging above the doorway, the brass numbers 28 above the lintel. The building looked inviting. The building looked like the kind of place that backpackers described in reviews as "charming" and "authentic" and "full of character," the words that travellers used for buildings that were old and slightly decaying and cheaper than the alternatives.

She pushed open the door. The bell above the door rang -- the same bell, the same ring, the sound that had announced the arrival of every guest since the bell was installed in 1971, the sound that Mei Ling heard at the reception counter and identified, without looking up, as the arrival of a new guest, the sound that was the hostel's version of a heartbeat, the systolic event that pumped new blood into the building's circulatory system.

The lobby was cool. Not air-conditioned -- the hostel had never had air conditioning, the building's thick walls and narrow proportions and the air well at its centre providing the thermal regulation that pre-war architecture had achieved through design rather than technology. The lobby smelled of wood polish and incense and, faintly, of coconut rice from the kitchen, the scent that was Mama Siti's signature, the olfactory announcement that the kitchen was staffed and the cook was present and the building was alive.

Mei Ling looked up. Mei Ling's face was the same face it had always been -- the professional composure of a receptionist who had checked in thousands of guests and had learned to greet each one with the neutral, efficient warmth that the job required. But behind the composure, behind the professional surface, there was something else now. Something that had not been there before Connor. Something that lived in her eyes when she looked at new guests -- particularly young guests, particularly foreign guests, particularly the guests who arrived alone and broke and carrying the restless energy of a person who was looking for something and might find something they were not looking for.

"Welcome to the Lantern Hostel. Do you have a reservation?"

"Yeah, I booked online. Sophie Nakamura-Reeves. Four nights."

Mei Ling typed. The booking system showed the reservation. Dorm 3. Bed 7.

Mei Ling paused. The pause was imperceptible to Sophie -- a fraction of a second, the hesitation of a cursor before a keystroke, the delay between receiving information and acting on it. The delay was the time Mei Ling's mind took to register the bed number and the associations the bed number carried and the decision that the bed number required, the decision that was: assign the bed as booked, or change it.

She could change it. She could say Bed 7 was unavailable -- maintenance, cleaning, a leak from the floor above. She could assign Sophie to Bed 3 or Bed 5 or any of the other beds in Dorm 3 that were currently vacant. She could redirect one guest away from one bed in one room and the redirecting would be an act of superstition or an act of caution or an act of the kind of care that Mei Ling had decided, after Connor's death, to exercise more deliberately than before.

But the bed was a bed. The bed was wood and foam and vinyl. The bed was not cursed or haunted or marked by anything except the name carved into its frame, and the name was a name, and the name belonged to a woman who was in a prison, not a ghost, and the bed's history was the bed's history, not the bed's future, and assigning a bed based on the history of its previous occupants was not hospitality but fear.

"Dorm 3, Bed 7. Here's your key. Second floor. Breakfast is seven to nine."

Sophie took the key. She smiled. The smile was the smile of a young person checking into a hostel in Southeast Asia -- bright, open, the smile of someone who was about to climb a narrow staircase and enter a shared room and put their bag on a bunk and look out a window and think *this is it, this is travel, this is the life*.

"Oh, one more thing," Mei Ling said.

Sophie turned.

Mei Ling reached under the counter. She pulled out a laminated card -- a card that had not existed three months ago, a card that Mei Ling had designed and printed and laminated and placed at the reception counter as part of the hostel's new policy, the policy that Razak had implemented after the investigation, after the media, after the reopening.

The card read:

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR GUESTS**

*Under Malaysian law, the possession of 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, 15 grams or more of heroin, or 200 grams or more of cannabis is punishable by mandatory death.*

*Never carry packages, envelopes, bags, or luggage for another person.*

*If you are approached by anyone offering paid "delivery" or "courier" work, please report it to reception immediately.*

*If you feel unsafe, please contact:*
*Royal Malaysia Police: 999*
*Australian High Commission: +60 3 2146 5555*
*British High Commission: +60 3 2170 2200*
*US Embassy: +60 3 2168 5000*

*The management of the Lantern Hostel takes the safety of our guests seriously.*

Sophie read the card. Her expression changed -- the bright smile dimming to the sober attention of a person reading a warning, the shift from tourist to citizen, from performer to person. She read the card again.

"Heavy," she said.

"Please keep it," Mei Ling said. "And please read the poster in the common room. And if anyone -- *anyone* -- asks you to carry something, come to me. Immediately."

Sophie nodded. The nod was the nod of a person who was taking a warning seriously because the warning was delivered seriously, the tone of Mei Ling's voice carrying the weight of a woman who had issued warnings before and been ignored and had decided that the issuing would continue regardless of the ignoring because the issuing was the only tool she had.

Sophie climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked.

Dorm 3 was the same dorm it had always been. Eight bunks, four on each side, the arrangement of beds that the building had housed since the dormitory was created in the 1960s. The walls were the same plaster. The ceiling fan was the same fan. The air well's opening in the centre of the building admitted the same light and the same air and the same sounds from the floors above and below.

Bed 7 was on the right side, lower bunk, second from the back, by the window that overlooked the air well. The bed was made with white sheets -- the standard hostel sheets that Mei Ling changed between guests, the sheets that were the blank canvas on which every guest's story was temporarily written and then laundered away.

Sophie put her backpack on the bed. She sat on the mattress. The mattress was thin -- foam on vinyl, the standard hostel mattress that was comfortable enough for sleep and uncomfortable enough to ensure that guests spent their days outside the dorm, in the common room, in the streets, in the city, rather than in their beds.

She looked around. The dorm was empty -- the other beds unoccupied, their sheets flat and smooth, the bunks waiting. The ceiling fan turned overhead, its blades slightly warped, the wobble creating a rhythm that was the room's ambient soundtrack: *tick, tick, tick*. The sound of a clock that measured nothing but its own rotation.

She lay back. Her hand found the bed frame -- the wooden rail that ran along the side of the lower bunk, the rail that provided the minimal structure between the bed and the drop to the floor. Her fingers rested on the wood. The wood was smooth, worn by decades of hands gripping it as guests climbed in and out of the bunk.

Her fingers found a groove. A series of grooves. Four grooves, arranged in a line, each one the width and depth of a letter carved into wood with a fingernail or a coin.

L. E. N. A.

Sophie did not look at the grooves. Sophie's fingers registered the sensation -- the slight irregularity in the wood's surface, the carved channels that her fingertips traced without her conscious attention. The grooves were there. The letters were there. The name was there.

The name of a Swedish woman who had slept in this bed and carried packages for a German trafficker and been arrested at a bus station and was now in a prison waiting for a trial. The name that Connor Briggs had placed his hand on every morning for forty-seven days without reading it. The name that David Briggs had touched during his visit to the hostel and thought was just damage, just wear.

The name was still there. The name would be there when Sophie left. The name would be there when the next guest arrived, and the next, and the next. The name was carved into the wood and the wood was part of the building and the building was ninety-seven years old and would stand for years more, and the name would persist -- the small, stubborn testimony of a woman who had wanted someone to know she had been there.

Sophie did not read the name. Sophie was looking at the ceiling, at the fan, at the light from the air well. Sophie was thinking about dinner -- which hawker stall, which dish, whether to try the durian that her guidebook described as "an acquired taste that most visitors do not acquire." Sophie was thinking about the Instagram post she would make tonight -- the hostel, the dorm, the charming-authentic-character of a building that was older than her grandmother. Sophie was thinking about tomorrow and the next day and the four nights she had booked and the life that stretched ahead of her, unwritten, uncarved, the blank wood of a story that had not yet been told.

She got up. She went downstairs. She went to the common room.

The common room was occupied. A few guests -- a British couple planning their itinerary at the coffee table, a Japanese student reading in the armchair, a German woman writing postcards. The German woman was young, blonde, wearing a linen dress and sandals, and her presence in the common room carried no significance beyond the significance of a tourist in a hostel. The German woman was not Felix Decker. The German woman was not a recruiter. The German woman was writing postcards to her parents in Stuttgart.

But the common room had a poster now. The poster was on the wall beside the bookshelf, at eye level, laminated, the text in English and Malay and Mandarin:

**KNOW THE LAW. KNOW THE RISK.**

*Malaysia's Dangerous Drugs Act carries the mandatory death penalty for trafficking. This is not a joke. This is not negotiable. This is the law.*

*If you are offered "easy money" to carry packages, SAY NO. Report it. Leave.*

*The Lantern Hostel has zero tolerance for drug-related activity.*

The poster was Razak's idea. The poster was part of the agreement he had reached with Ahmad -- the agreement that allowed the hostel to remain open in exchange for Razak's full cooperation with the investigation and the implementation of measures to prevent future recruitment. The poster was the visible output of the agreement. The poster was also Razak's penance, the public acknowledgement of a complicity that had cost a girl her freedom and a boy his life.

Sophie saw the poster. She read it. She took a photo of it -- for Instagram, not for reference, the photo captioned *Malaysia doesn't mess around. #DrugLaws #Scary #TravelSafe*. The photo got 34 likes.

She sat on the sofa. She opened her guidebook. She began planning her evening -- Petaling Street's night market, char kway teow, the kind of experience she would document and share and her followers would like and the documentation would be the experience because that was the condition of modern travel. The condition that Connor Briggs had understood perfectly. The condition that his death had not altered because it was structural, not personal -- the system that produced Connors and Olivers and Sophies, the system that sent young people into the world with phones and confidence and the belief that the world was a playground rather than a mechanism.

At seven PM, Mama Siti prepared the evening meal.

The kitchen was hers. The kitchen had always been hers. The kitchen would remain hers for as long as she was alive and the building was standing and the stove produced flame and the rice steamed and the sambal burned and the nasi lemak emerged from her hands with the consistency and care that she had brought to every plate for thirty years.

She cooked. She cooked the way she had always cooked -- with attention, with precision, with the quiet authority of a woman who understood that food was not fuel but communication, that a plate of nasi lemak was not a meal but a message, and the message was: *I am here. I am watching. I care whether you eat.*

She set the plates on the counter. The plates were for the guests. The guests would come to the kitchen at seven and sit at the counter and eat and the eating would be the normalcy that the building required, the daily ritual that kept the building alive, the rhythm that the building's heart beat to.

She did not set an extra plate. She had stopped that on the eighth day, when the rain took the last one. But she paused, as she always paused now, at the end of the counter -- the position where Connor had stood every morning for forty-seven mornings. The position was empty. The position would remain empty. And the pause was the plate's ghost, the ceremony's echo, the grief that had been released but that the hands still remembered.

She cooked. She served. She watched the guests eat. And the pause at the end of the counter was the only mark of what had been -- not a plate but an absence, not a vigil but a habit, the muscle memory of caring for someone who was no longer there to be cared for.

The building held the memory. The building held it in the wood and the plaster and the tiles and the layers of paint under which the Japanese characters waited and the stories accumulated and the names were carved and the deaths were absorbed. The building's memory did not require a plate. The building remembered in its own language -- the squeak on the third step, the name on the bed frame, the air well that breathed, the ceiling fans that turned.

At nine PM, Sophie sat on the rooftop.

The rooftop was there. The plastic chairs were there. The zinc railing was there. The Petronas Towers were there -- silver-white against the night sky, the twin columns that dominated KL's skyline and provided the visual landmark that oriented every tourist and every resident and every person who had ever looked at the city and needed a fixed point.

Sophie sat in a plastic chair. She held her phone. She was composing an Instagram post. The photo was of the towers, taken from the rooftop, the angle showing the skyline and the night and the lights of a city that was beautiful in the way that all cities were beautiful from above -- the grid of lights, the movement of traffic, the collective luminosity of millions of lives generating the glow that replaced the stars.

She captioned the photo: *KL nights. This city is EVERYTHING. The hostel is so cute, staff are lovely, and the food is incredible. #KualaLumpur #BackpackerLife #LivingTheDream*

Living the dream. The same words from a different person in the same chair on the same rooftop, three months after the last person who used those words was strangled with his own towel in a cell three kilometres away.

Sophie posted the photo. The photo got 47 likes. The same number of likes that Connor's last post had received. The algorithm was consistent even when the people were not.

She sat on the rooftop. The city hummed below. The towers watched. The building was patient beneath her, the building that had been here since 1928, the constant in a story of variables. Different actors, same script. The people came and went and lived and died and the dying was absorbed and the living continued.

The ceiling fan in Dorm 3 turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The name waited on the bed frame. L-E-N-A.

The counter's end was empty.

The red lanterns glowed.

The building breathed.

And somewhere -- in the algorithm, in the internet, in the space between the digital and the real -- @HostelReaper was watching. @HostelReaper was always watching. The checkout was mandatory. The check-in was voluntary. And the space between the two -- the space of days and nights and meals and deliveries and warnings and silences and the slow, grinding machinery of a system that consumed the willing -- the space was the hostel, and the hostel was open, and the bed was available, and the next story was beginning.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*
