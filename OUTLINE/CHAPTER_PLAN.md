**POV:** Connor
**Location:** KLIA2 Airport → KL Sentral → Petaling Street → The Lantern Hostel
**Timeline:** Day 1, Late Afternoon/Evening
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Introduce Connor, establish his archetype, his fatal flaw (arrogant ignorance), and the sensory world of KL. First impressions of the hostel.

**Scenes:**
1. Connor lands at KLIA2 on a cheap AirAsia flight from Bali. His internal monologue establishes who he is - breezy, entitled, confident. He doesn't have a plan for KL because plans are "for amateurs."
2. Journey through KL to Petaling Street. The city assaults his senses. He films everything, understands nothing. First encounter with a sign warning about drug penalties (he doesn't read it).
3. Arrival at The Lantern Hostel. Mei Ling checks him in. First impression of the building - the red lanterns, the narrow staircase, the smell. He's assigned Dorm 3, Bed 7. He doesn't notice Lena's name scratched into the bed frame.

**Must Include:**
- [x] Introduce Connor's character and voice
- [x] Establish fatal flaw (first glimpse) - he ignores a drug penalty warning sign
- [x] Set KL's atmosphere and sensory world
- [x] The Lantern Hostel's first impression
- [x] Foreshadowing: Lena's name on the bed, the drug warning sign, the red rule about Malaysian law

### Chapter 2: "The German"
**POV:** Connor
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel (common room, rooftop)
**Timeline:** Day 1, Night
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Introduce Felix and establish the seductive friendship. Introduce Jake. Set up the hostel's social dynamics.

**Scenes:**
1. Common room evening scene. Connor meets the regular crew - Jake (instant bro bonding), a few other travelers. The hostel at night - atmosphere shifts. Red lanterns glow.
2. Felix appears. He's different from the other backpackers - polished, knowing, generous. He buys Connor a beer. They talk travel. Felix has stories that are slightly too good.
3. Rooftop conversation. Felix and Connor alone. Felix casually mentions that he knows how to "get by" in KL without spending much. Connor is intrigued. The Petronas Towers glitter in the background.

**Must Include:**
- [x] Felix introduction - charisma, polish, subtle wrongness
- [x] Jake introduction - comedic counterpart
- [x] Hostel nightlife dynamics
- [x] Connor's fatal flaw: he trusts Felix immediately because Felix is cool
- [x] Foreshadowing: Felix's too-good stories, his cash payments, his private room

---

### Chapter 3: "Petaling Street"
**POV:** Connor (with Priya introduction)
**Location:** Petaling Street, Chinatown, Bukit Bintang
**Timeline:** Day 2, Morning to Afternoon
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Establish KL as a character. Introduce Priya. Show Connor's cultural ignorance in action. First @HostelReaper reference.

**Scenes:**
1. Morning at the hostel. Mama Siti's breakfast. Connor navigates the communal kitchen culture. First daylight impression of the hostel - the air well, the peeling walls, the charm and decay.
2. Connor and Jake explore Petaling Street and Chinatown. Connor films everything, butchers every interaction, bargains aggressively (culturally inappropriate), and takes photos of people without permission. He's having the time of his life. He's insufferable.
3. Priya appears - they meet at a hawker stall. She's everything Connor isn't: researched, respectful, curious. She intrigues him despite (because of?) their opposition. She's reading a guidebook section about Malaysian law. He teases her about it.
4. Brief scene: Connor notices graffiti on a wall - "@HostelReaper" with a small reaper icon. He photographs it for Instagram. Thinks it's "street art."

**Must Include:**
- [x] Priya introduction
- [x] KL sensory world in full
- [x] Connor's cultural ignorance in action (comic scenes)
- [x] First @HostelReaper reference (graffiti)
- [x] Foreshadowing: Priya's guidebook mentions drug laws
- [x] Hook ending: Connor gets a text from Felix - "Free tonight? Got something fun."

---

### Chapter 4: "The Crew"
**POV:** Connor
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel, Changkat Bukit Bintang (nightlife district)
**Timeline:** Day 2, Night to Day 3, Early Morning
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Solidify the friend group dynamics. Deepen Felix's manipulation. Introduce Tomoko. Show Connor's spending problem.

**Scenes:**
1. Pre-drinks on the hostel rooftop. The crew assembles: Connor, Jake, Felix, Priya (reluctant), and other travelers. Tomoko is there, quiet, observing. Connor tries to talk to her; she's polite but guarded.
2. Night out on Changkat Bukit Bintang. Felix leads, knows every bar, gets them past every line. Connor burns through money. The night is electric, chaotic, too much fun. Felix pays for things casually.
3. End of night. Connor checks his bank balance: lower than he thought. Felix notices his discomfort. "I might know a way to make some easy cash, if you're interested." Connor laughs it off but doesn't say no.
4. Brief Tomoko interlude: she watches Felix and Connor from across the bar. She takes a photo of them on her professional camera. Something about Felix doesn't add up.

**Must Include:**
- [x] Tomoko introduction
- [x] Felix's generosity as manipulation tool
- [x] Connor's financial vulnerability
- [x] The friend group dynamics crystallized
- [x] Foreshadowing: Felix's "easy cash" mention

---

### Chapter 5: "Content Creator"
**POV:** Connor
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel, various KL cafes
**Timeline:** Day 3-5 (compressed)
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Establish Connor's daily routine, the gap between his online persona and reality. Deepen his relationship with Priya. Show how the hostel becomes a home he can't afford.

**Scenes:**
1. Connor's "work" day - sitting in a hipster cafe near the hostel, laptop open, pretending to be a digital nomad. He writes nothing of value. His "social media consulting" amounts to one client who pays him $150/month. He photographs his coffee for Instagram.
2. Money anxiety. Connor does the math: at this rate, he has two weeks before he's broke. His parents' next deposit isn't for ten days. He considers asking for more money. His pride won't let him. He considers going home. The thought is worse than poverty.
3. Connor and Priya afternoon together. They visit the Batu Caves or the Central Market. Real conversation - Priya cracks his surface. A sympathetic moment: Connor admits he doesn't know what he's doing with his life. She sees the real person under the persona. The reader cares about him, briefly.
4. Evening: Felix finds Connor on the rooftop, notices his stress. "That offer's still open, mate. Nothing illegal. Just... logistics." The way he says it makes it sound reasonable.

**Must Include:**
- [x] The gap between Connor's online life and reality
- [x] Financial pressure as vulnerability
- [x] Sympathetic moment (Connor admits his fears to Priya)
- [x] Felix's escalation - the "offer" becomes concrete
- [x] Foreshadowing: Connor walks past Wei's phone repair shop without noting it
- [x] Hook ending: Connor texts Felix back: "Tell me more"

---

### Chapter 6: "The Envelope"
**POV:** Connor
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel, Petaling Street, a café in Bukit Bintang
**Timeline:** Day 6
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** The first favor. Connor carries a sealed envelope for Felix. The beginning of the trap. Introduce Aziz's silent warning.

**Scenes:**
1. Felix explains the "job": just deliver an envelope to a man at a café in Bukit Bintang. Simple. Felix would do it himself but he has a meeting. It's just business documents for an import company. RM200 for twenty minutes of walking. Connor agrees immediately.
2. The delivery. Connor walks through KL with the envelope in his back pocket. He doesn't open it, doesn't think about it. He's focused on the money and on filming the walk for his "day in the life" content. The delivery is smooth - a nondescript man at a café takes the envelope, nods, leaves. Connor gets a Grab notification: RM200 transferred.
3. Back at the hostel, high on easy money. He tells Jake about the "side hustle." Jake is impressed. Priya overhears and her expression darkens but she says nothing yet. Aziz is fixing a fan in the dorm. He pauses at the door, looks at Connor, opens his mouth. Closes it. Leaves.
4. That night, Connor can't sleep. Bed 7 is uncomfortable. He rolls over. His hand brushes something scratched into the wooden bed frame. He doesn't look at it. If he had, he'd see the name LENA.

**Must Include:**
- [x] The first "favor" - seemingly innocent
- [x] Connor's fatal flaw in action: he doesn't question, doesn't check
- [x] The ease of the money reinforcing the behavior
- [x] Aziz's silent warning (failed)
- [x] Foreshadowing: Lena's name (again, unnoticed), the envelope's real contents
- [x] Hook ending: Felix texts: "See? Easy. Got another one tomorrow if you're keen."

### Chapter 7: "The Law You Don't Know"
**POV:** Connor (with Mama Siti scene)
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel (kitchen, common room), National Mosque vicinity
**Timeline:** Day 7-8
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Mama Siti's warning. Cultural immersion chapter. The hostel as a world. Deepen Connor's willful ignorance.

**Scenes:**
1. Morning. Connor in the kitchen trying to make toast. Mama Siti is cooking nasi lemak. She speaks to Connor in a mix of English and Malay. She tells him a proverb: "Orang yang tak tahu undang-undang, undang-undang tak tahu dia." He asks for hot sauce. She looks at him the way you look at someone who is already gone.
2. Connor and Priya visit a mosque. Connor almost enters with his shoes on and in shorts. Priya stops him, educates him about the dress code. He borrows a sarong. Inside, the beauty and peace of the space genuinely affect him - a rare moment of openness. Then he takes a selfie.
3. Common room evening. A group of travelers are watching a documentary on TV about drug trafficking in Southeast Asia. A segment shows a Malaysian courtroom, a defendant being sentenced to death. Connor watches for a moment, then changes the channel to football. "That's heavy, man. Can we not?"
4. Late night. Priya and Connor on the air well bench. Stars visible above. She asks him if he's looked into Malaysian laws. He says "I'm not breaking any laws." She says "How would you know? Have you looked?" He kisses her to avoid answering.

**Must Include:**
- [x] Mama Siti's proverb (foreshadowing)
- [x] Cultural immersion - mosque visit
- [x] Connor's ignorance demonstrated (the documentary he refuses to watch)
- [x] Deepening Connor-Priya relationship
- [x] Foreshadowing: the documentary about drug trafficking, the death penalty
- [x] Hook ending: The kiss, but also - Connor's phone buzzes. Felix again.

### Chapter 8: "The Package"
**POV:** Connor
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel, KL Central, Brickfields neighborhood
**Timeline:** Day 9-10
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Escalation of the favors - from envelope to package. Connor crosses a line he doesn't recognize. Second @HostelReaper reference.

**Scenes:**
1. Felix's second job. This time it's a package - a shoebox-sized box, wrapped in brown paper, taped shut. "Phone accessories for a distributor in Brickfields." RM500. Connor takes it without hesitation. The weight feels wrong but he doesn't think about it.
2. The delivery to Brickfields (Little India). Connor walks through the Indian neighborhood, sensory overload - incense, Hindi music, curry, garlands of jasmine. He finds the address: the back entrance of a wholesale electronics shop. A man takes the package without making eye contact.
3. On the walk back, Connor passes a police officer. For a split second, his stomach drops - primal fear. Then he rationalizes: he's not carrying anything now. He was just delivering phone stuff. He's fine. He buys a teh tarik to celebrate and watches the sunset.
4. Back at the hostel. Connor checks Instagram. In his explore feed, there's a post from @HostelReaper: a photo of a backpack on a bus seat, caption "Another one packed for the journey. #NoReturn." He scrolls past it.

**Must Include:**
- [x] The escalation: envelope → package
- [x] Connor's rationalization process
- [x] The flash of fear immediately suppressed
- [x] Second @HostelReaper reference (Instagram)
- [x] Brickfields neighborhood sensory details
- [x] Foreshadowing: the package's weight, the man's refusal to make eye contact
- [x] Hook ending: Felix says "You're a natural, Connor. I've got something bigger."

### Chapter 9: "The Map of the Dead"
**POV:** Connor (with Uncle Razak scene)
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel (Razak's office), Petaling Street night market
**Timeline:** Day 11-12
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** Uncle Razak reveals his obsession with hostel deaths. Connor sees it as content, not warning. Deepen the hostel as a character.

**Scenes:**
1. Uncle Razak invites Connor to his office for tea. The office is a revelation: cluttered, dark, walls covered in newspaper clippings about deaths in hostels and guesthouses worldwide. A large map with red pins. Razak tells stories - each pin is a death. He speaks of them with a collector's detachment. "The building remembers," he says. Connor is fascinated but not afraid. He asks to photograph the map for Instagram.
2. Razak tells Connor about the hostel's history - the Japanese occupation, the gambling den, the brothel. "Every use leaves ghosts." He says the building has a hunger. Connor laughs: "Like the wifi, it's never satisfied." Razak doesn't laugh.
3. Night market with Jake and Priya. Normalcy. Fun. Good food. Connor is generous with his new money (Felix's money). He buys Priya a jade bracelet from a market stall. For a moment, everything is just travel: colorful, warm, human. This is the high before the fall.
4. Walking home through the darkened streets. Connor passes Wei's phone repair shop. The light is on late. Through the window, for a moment, he sees Felix inside, talking to Wei. They're both looking at something on a table. Connor waves. Felix doesn't wave back.

**Must Include:**
- [x] Razak's map of deaths (foreshadowing)
- [x] The hostel's dark history
- [x] The night market as normalcy/beauty (calm before the storm)
- [x] Felix seen at Wei's shop (subtle setup)
- [x] Foreshadowing: the map, Razak's stories, Felix and Wei together
- [x] Hook ending: Felix doesn't wave back. Why?

### Chapter 10: "Comfortable"
**POV:** Connor
**Location:** The Lantern Hostel (dorm, rooftop), various KL
**Timeline:** Day 13-15
**Word Target:** 5,500

**Purpose:** End of setup. Connor is settled, comfortable, earning money from Felix, in a semi-relationship with Priya. Everything is perfect. The reader knows it can't last. Transition to escalation.

**Scenes:**
1. Connor's routine is established. He wakes late, has Mama Siti's breakfast, does a "delivery" for Felix (now his third package), has lunch, pretends to work at the café, meets Priya, goes out at night. He's found his groove. He's stopped thinking about going home. He's even thinking about extending to months.
2. Priya confrontation (soft). She asks about the deliveries. He deflects with charm. She pushes: "Connor, you don't even know what's in those packages." He says: "It's phone stuff, babe. Felix wouldn't..." She says: "You don't know Felix." He gets defensive: "You don't know him like I do." First real tension between them.
3. Tomoko approaches Connor in the common room. She's direct: "Your friend Felix. I've seen people like him before. Be careful." Connor, stung by Priya's earlier words, is dismissive: "Jesus, what is it with everyone today? I'm fine." Tomoko doesn't push. She never pushes twice.
4. Night. Rooftop. Connor alone. He looks at the Petronas Towers. He calls his mother. She's happy to hear from him. She says "I just want you to be safe." He says "I'm always safe, Mum." The call ends. Connor looks at the city. He thinks: *This is the life. This is what people back home will never understand.* He is purely, simply happy. It's the last time he'll feel this way.

**Must Include:**
- [x] Established routine (Connor is settled in)
- [x] Priya's first real pushback
- [x] Tomoko's direct warning
- [x] The phone call with his mother (sympathetic, ominous)
- [x] Connor's happiness as dramatic irony
- [x] Foreshadowing: three packages now, Priya's question about contents
- [x] Hook ending: Connor's happiness on the rooftop → cut to morning, Felix knocking on the dorm door at 6 AM with "something different" to discuss
