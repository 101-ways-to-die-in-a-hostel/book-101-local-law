# Chapter 37: The Blue Towel

Rizal stood.

The movement was small. The movement was the transition from sitting to standing, the simple mechanical act of legs straightening and a body rising from a bench, the act that every human performed a hundred times a day without thought or deliberation. But the movement changed the cell. The movement changed the air. The movement changed the relationship between the two bodies in the space -- from the horizontal and the vertical, from the lying and the sitting, from the configuration of rest to the configuration of something else.

Connor opened his eyes.

He had not been sleeping. The not-sleeping was the state he'd occupied for hours -- the shallow, buzzing drift between consciousness and its absence, the state where the body lay still and the mind ran and the two existed in the same space without cooperation, the body wanting rest and the mind refusing it, the mind cycling through the same corridors, the same rooms, the same questions, the same unanswerable facts.

He opened his eyes and saw Rizal standing.

"You okay?" Connor said. The question was automatic, the reflex of a person who noticed another person's movement and responded with the social currency of concern. The question was asked from the bench, from the horizontal, from the position of a man lying down and looking up at a man standing.

Rizal didn't answer.

The not-answering was the first wrong thing. Rizal had answered everything -- every question, every observation, every fragment of conversation that Connor had produced during the hours of their confinement. Rizal had been the answering machine, the responsive surface, the voice that met every voice. The silence was new. The silence was different. The silence was the sound of a function ending and another function beginning.

Connor sat up. The sitting up was the movement of a body responding to a change in the environment, the instinct to be vertical when the situation demanded alertness. He sat on the bench. The blue towel fell from his shoulders to the bench surface, the microfiber pooling on the steel in a soft blue heap.

Rizal was standing between the two benches. The cell was small -- three metres by three. The benches ran along opposite walls. The space between them was less than a metre. Rizal was in that space, standing, his body filling the gap between the benches, his shadow cast on the wall by the fluorescent light.

"Rizal?"

Rizal moved.

The movement was fast. Not the fast of panic or the fast of anger but the fast of competence, the fast of a body that had rehearsed this motion and was now performing it with the mechanical efficiency of repetition. Rizal's right hand reached down. His fingers closed around the blue towel on the bench. The towel came up. The towel moved through the air in a single, fluid arc -- from the bench to Connor's neck.

Connor's brain registered the towel's movement approximately 200 milliseconds before the towel reached his throat. The 200 milliseconds was not enough time to move. The 200 milliseconds was enough time to begin to understand -- to begin to process the visual information of a man's hand holding a towel and the towel's trajectory describing the geometry of what was about to happen. The understanding arrived incomplete. The understanding was a fragment, a partial image, a half-formed thought that started with *why is he* and ended nowhere because the towel reached his neck.

The towel went around his throat from behind. Rizal had moved -- in the same motion, the same economy of movement, he had stepped to Connor's side and then behind him, the footwork of a man who knew the choreography, who had performed this choreography before, who understood that the approach was from behind, always from behind, because the front presented too many variables -- hands, arms, the unpredictability of a face-to-face confrontation.

The towel pulled tight.

The sensation was not what Connor expected. He had no expectation -- the event was too sudden, too discontinuous from the previous state, the transition from lying on a bench to being strangled too large for the mind to prepare for. But if he had expected something, he might have expected pain, the sharp pain of a thin ligature cutting into flesh, the pain of rope or wire or the hard edge of a cord.

The towel did not cut. The towel compressed. The microfiber was wide -- the full width of the towel, folded once, creating a band of fabric approximately five centimetres across. The band pressed against his throat not as a line but as a surface, the pressure distributed across the front and sides of his neck, the compression even, the effect not a cut but a squeeze, the closing of the airway not by penetration but by external pressure, the trachea pressed flat by the soft, smooth, terribly efficient fabric of a Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel.

Connor's hands flew to his neck. The movement was involuntary -- the body's first and most powerful response to strangulation, the hands reaching for the ligature, the fingers trying to find purchase, to hook under the fabric, to create space between the towel and the throat, to restore the airflow that had been cut off.

His fingers found the towel. His fingers could not grip it.

The microfiber was smooth. That was its design. That was the engineering that made it a good travel towel -- the tight weave, the smooth surface, the fabric that dried fast because water couldn't cling to it, the fabric that packed small because the fibres were flat and dense. The same properties that made it a good towel made it a terrible ligature to fight against. His fingernails scraped the surface and slid. His fingertips pressed and could not find an edge to hook under. The towel was tight against his throat, pulled by Rizal's hands, and the tightness left no gap, no space for fingers to insert, no purchase for the desperate, scrabbling hands of a man who was being choked by his own most familiar possession.

He kicked. His legs, hanging off the bench, found the floor. His flip-flops -- the Birkenstocks that Priya had mocked -- scraped against the concrete. He tried to stand. Rizal's weight prevented it -- Rizal was behind him, leaning back, using his body weight as leverage, the physics of strangulation requiring not strength but position, the advantage of standing behind a seated man, the advantage of gravity and angle and the simple mechanical fact that a man being choked from behind could not generate the force necessary to dislodge the choker.

Connor's legs kicked. His feet hit the bench. His knees hit the wall. The cell was too small for the struggle -- the walls were there, the benches were there, the space was designed for containment and the containment was now the context of his death, the walls preventing escape, the benches limiting movement, the architecture of the cell collaborating with the man and the towel.

Four seconds had passed since the towel touched his throat.

His vision changed. The fluorescent light, which had been the constant, dominant visual element of the cell -- the flat blue-white that illuminated everything -- the light began to change. Not the light itself but his perception of it. The edges of his visual field darkened. The darkening was not gradual but sudden, the periphery going first, the way a tunnel closed, the world narrowing from a wide field to a circle, the circle shrinking, the light at the centre intensifying as the darkness closed in.

He could hear his own body. The sounds were internal -- the rushing of blood in his ears, the percussion of his heart, the heart beating faster and harder as the body responded to the oxygen deprivation with the only tool it had, which was to pump harder, to push the blood faster through the vessels, to squeeze the remaining oxygen from the haemoglobin and deliver it to the brain, the brain that was the priority, the brain that the body would sacrifice everything to protect, everything except the thing that was killing it, which was the towel around its throat.

His hands were still at his neck. The fingers were still scraping. The fingernails -- bitten, chewed, the nails of a man who had been biting his nails since childhood, the habit that his mother had tried to break with bitter-tasting nail polish and that had persisted through twenty-seven years as the physical manifestation of an anxiety that now, in the final moments, was justified -- the fingernails found no purchase. The towel was smooth. The towel was tight. The towel was the thing that was killing him and the thing he had loved and the thing he had carried through twelve countries and packed in his bag at his mother's kitchen counter and dried himself with on beaches and in hostels and in the shared bathrooms of a life that had been lived on the move, always on the move, never staying, never settling, the towel the constant in a life of variables.

Eight seconds.

His body changed strategy. The hands stopped trying to grip the towel. The hands reached back, behind, toward Rizal. His fingers found Rizal's arms -- the forearms, the muscles tensed, the arms that were pulling the towel's ends in opposite directions, creating the tension that closed the band around his throat. Connor grabbed Rizal's arms. He squeezed. The squeezing had no effect. Rizal's arms were stone. Rizal's arms were the arms of a man who was performing a function, not fighting a fight, and the function required patience not strength, required holding not escalating, required waiting for the body to exhaust itself, which it would, which all bodies did, which was the inevitable conclusion of the physics of strangulation: the body fought, and the fighting required oxygen, and the oxygen was not available, and the fighting therefore consumed the last reserves, and the reserves ran out, and the body stopped.

Twelve seconds.

Connor's thoughts fragmented. The thoughts that had been running in sentences -- the thoughts that had been processing the event, analysing it, narrating it in the third person the way his mind had narrated everything since the first envelope, the constant internal monologue that had been his companion and his curse -- the sentences broke. The words separated. The syntax collapsed.

*Towel.*

*Can't.*

*Mum.*

The fragments were not language. The fragments were the last firings of a neurological system running on fumes, the system producing signal without structure, meaning without grammar, the raw output of a brain that was losing the ability to organise its own activity, the brain shutting down the higher functions first -- language, analysis, self-awareness -- and preserving the lower functions -- heart, lungs, the reflexive struggle of limbs -- the triage of a system in catastrophic failure.

Fifteen seconds.

His legs stopped kicking. The stopping was not a decision. The stopping was the depletion of the resource -- the oxygen that the muscles needed to contract, the oxygen that was not arriving, the oxygen that had been cut off for fifteen seconds which was long enough for the body's reserves to diminish to the level at which voluntary movement became impossible. His legs were still. His arms were still. His hands, which had been reaching for Rizal's forearms, fell to his sides.

His eyes were open. The visual field had narrowed to a small circle at the centre of his vision. The circle contained one thing: the fluorescent light on the ceiling. The tube. The buzzing, humming, never-ending tube that had been the cell's dominant feature since he'd arrived, the light that was the opposite of darkness, the light of places where time stopped, the light that was now the last thing he would see.

The light was beautiful. This was unexpected. The light, which had been ugly and clinical and the aesthetic of institutions that did not care about beauty, the light was now, in the narrowing circle of his dying vision, beautiful. The light was white and clean and the buzzing was not a buzz but a hum and the hum was not mechanical but almost musical, a single sustained note, the note of a fluorescent tube doing the one thing it was designed to do, which was to produce light, which was to illuminate, which was, in the final analysis, a kind of generosity -- the generosity of a thing that gave everything it had to give without reservation or condition, the light falling on everything equally, the bench and the walls and the bars and the towel and the man and the man who was dying.

Twenty seconds.

His last coherent thought was not a thought. His last coherent thought was a voice. The voice was his mother's voice. The voice said the thing his mother said every Sunday on the phone, the thing she said at the end of every call, the thing she said as both farewell and instruction and love:

*Call me when you land.*

He hadn't called. He'd landed in KL forty-seven days ago and he hadn't called. He'd told himself he would and he hadn't. The not-calling was the cruelest thing, the thing he'd done to her without meaning to, the thing that children did to parents -- the slow forgetting, the gradual recession of home from urgent to background, from primary to secondary, the forgetting that was not cruelty but was the natural, inevitable consequence of a life lived far away, the consequence that every mother feared and every child produced.

He hadn't called. He would never call. The phone was in a plastic bag at the processing desk. The phone's last text was from his mother. The phone's last text said: *Are you eating well? Please call soon. Love Mum xxx*

*Mum.*

The word was not spoken. The word was not thought. The word was something deeper than thought, something that existed in the body rather than the mind, something that the body produced in its final moments the way a candle produced light in its final moments, the last output of a system that was shutting down, the last signal from a consciousness that was dissolving, the last word from a person who was ceasing to be a person.

Twenty-five seconds.

The visual field closed. The circle became a point. The point became nothing.

Thirty seconds.

His body went limp. The full, complete limpness of a body that had stopped fighting, stopped trying, stopped generating the electrical signals that powered the muscles and the movements and the struggle. The body was still. The body was weight. The body was the mass of a twenty-seven-year-old man, seventy-eight kilograms, suspended by a towel, held by a man who was patient and professional and waiting for the job to be complete.

Rizal held the towel for three more minutes. The three minutes were necessary -- the insurance, the margin of certainty, the professional's protocol for ensuring that the outcome was the outcome. During the three minutes, there was no movement. No twitch. No reflex. The body was still.

Rizal released the towel.

The body slumped forward. The body was on the bench, the torso draped over the knees, the head hanging, the arms at the sides. Rizal stepped back. He looked at the body. The look was the look of a man confirming a result, the look that a technician gave a completed task, the look that preceded the next step.

The next step was the staging.

Rizal worked quickly. He took the towel -- the blue towel, the Sea to Summit microfiber that had been to twelve countries and was now in a cell at Dang Wangi and was warm from Connor's body and damp from Connor's sweat and smelled of sunscreen and the South China Sea and the accumulated olfactory memory of a life that had ended. He knotted the towel. One end around the horizontal bar at the top of the cell door -- the bar that ran across the top of the barred section, the bar that was at approximately six feet, the height that was necessary for the staging. The other end around Connor's neck. The knot was simple, functional, the knot that a despondent man might tie in a hurry, the knot that was consistent with suicide, the knot that would be photographed and documented and described in a report as *ligature consistent with self-inflicted hanging*.

Rizal positioned the body. The body was lifted -- Rizal was strong, the strength that had held the towel tight for three and a half minutes now deployed in the lifting of seventy-eight kilograms of dead weight, the body positioned so that it hung from the bar, the knees bent because the bar was not high enough for a full suspension, the weight supported by the towel around the neck, the posture of a man who had knotted his towel to a bar and leaned into it and let gravity do the work that despair had ordered.

The staging was complete. The body hung. The towel held.

Rizal returned to his bench. He sat. He adopted the posture of a man who had been sleeping and had been awakened by something -- the posture that he would present to the guard when the guard returned, the posture of a cellmate who had woken to find the other man hanging, the posture that would generate the statements and the reports and the official record of a suicide in custody that was not a suicide, that was a murder, that was the network's protocol for silencing a mule who had talked.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The light fell on the body the way it fell on everything -- equally, without preference, without judgement. The light illuminated the blue towel and the knot and the bar and the face that was Connor's face and was no longer Connor's face because the person who had animated it was gone, the person who had smiled and frowned and laughed and kissed and looked at the Petronas Towers from a rooftop and eaten nasi lemak in a kitchen and held a jade bracelet to a woman's wrist and walked through streets that smelled of incense and diesel and durian -- the person was gone and the face remained and the face was the shell that the person had left behind, the way a building remained after the occupant left, the structure intact, the life absent.

The cell was quiet.

The cell was quiet the way all rooms were quiet after something ended in them -- not the quiet of emptiness but the quiet of aftermath, the particular silence that occupied a space where sound had recently been, where the struggle had produced the sounds of struggle -- the scraping of shoes, the gasping of breath, the contact of hands on fabric, the percussive rhythm of a body fighting for its life -- and where the sounds had now ceased and the silence that replaced them was not peaceful but loaded, the silence of a room that knew what had happened in it.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The body hung. The towel held.

And outside the cell, outside the corridor, outside the building, outside the station, the city continued. Kuala Lumpur at midnight was the Kuala Lumpur it always was -- the lights, the traffic, the hum of eight million lives generating the ambient noise that was the city's heartbeat. The Petronas Towers were lit. The night market on Petaling Street was closing. Mama Siti's kitchen was dark. The ceiling fan in Dorm 3 was turning. The name on the bed frame was waiting.

The city did not pause. The city did not note the passing. The city absorbed the death the way it absorbed everything -- silently, completely, without judgement -- and the city moved on, and the traffic moved, and the lights stayed on, and the morning would come, and the morning would find what the night had left, and the finding would activate the system, and the system would produce the words that systems produced when a prisoner was found dead in his cell, the words that were clinical and bureaucratic and procedurally correct and entirely, devastatingly insufficient:

*Suicide while in custody.*

The fluorescent light buzzed.

The blue towel held.
