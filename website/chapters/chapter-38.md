# Chapter 38: Discovery

Hafiz came back at 11:55 PM.

The return was physically identical to every other return from every other bathroom break he had taken during his eighteen months at Dang Wangi -- the same doors, the same corridors, the same duty desk at the end of the hallway, the same fluorescent light casting the same flat white on the same linoleum floor. But he was carrying RM5,000 in his bank account that had not been there forty minutes ago, and the weight of that money made his footsteps different.

He sat at the duty desk. He placed his phone on the desk. He looked at the corridor. The corridor was empty, lit, quiet. The steel door that separated the desk from the cell block was closed, the way he had left it.

He picked up the paper log -- the handwritten record that existed alongside the digital records, the CCTV footage, the electronic entry logs. The paper log was the document that would be examined, later, by investigators and journalists and lawyers and diplomats. He wrote:

*23:55 -- Returned to duty desk from break. All quiet.*

The word *break* was a lie. The word *break* was not the word for a forty-minute absence purchased for RM5,000 by a text message from an unknown number. But the word *break* was the word that would appear in the log, and the log was the record, and the record was the truth, and the truth was whatever the record said it was.

He sat for three minutes, waiting for his hands to steady. Then he took the torch from its hook -- he didn't need it, the corridor was lit, but the torch was protocol -- and opened the steel door.

He walked the corridor. Twelve metres long, cells on the right side. Eight cells. Three occupied. He walked slowly, the measured pace of a night-shift guard covering ground in a space where nothing was expected to change.

Cell 1. He slid the observation panel open. A Malaysian man, arrested for assault, sleeping on the bench. Heavy, slow breathing. The man was fine. He closed the slot.

Cell 2. Empty. The fluorescent light off in unoccupied cells.

Cell 3. Two men sleeping, one on the bench, one on the floor with a shirt folded into a pillow. Both quiet. He closed the slot.

Cells 4, 5, 6. Empty.

Cell 7.

Hafiz stopped at Cell 7. The stopping was not deliberate -- the body responding to a signal the mind had not yet processed.

He slid the observation panel open.

The first thing he saw was colour. Blue. The blue was wrong. The blue was in the wrong place -- not on the bench, where it had been during the ten o'clock round, not spread across a sleeping man's shoulders, not pooled on the steel surface as a makeshift blanket. The blue was vertical. The blue was at the level of the door's top bar. The blue was a towel, and the towel was knotted to the bar, and below the towel was a body.

The conclusion arrived in approximately 400 milliseconds. The blue towel attached to the top bar. The body suspended below it, knees bent, feet near the floor. Two hours ago, the body had been horizontal on the bench, alive, breathing, wrapped in the same towel. Now the body was no longer alive.

The second conclusion arrived 200 milliseconds later: *This is what the money was for.*

He had known. He had known in the way that humans knew things they didn't explicitly think -- the way a person knew that a gift was not free when the giver was a stranger. He had known that the text message and the RM5,000 and the forty-minute absence were connected to something in the cells, something that required the guard to not be present, something that could not happen while the cells were watched. But knowing in the abstract and seeing in the concrete were different. The text message had been words. Words were manageable, deniable, interpretable. The body was not words. The body was mass and gravity and the colour of skin when the blood stopped flowing, the specific terrible stillness of a human form that had stopped.

His hand was on the observation panel. The hand was trembling.

He looked at the other man in the cell. Rizal. The bar fight man. Rizal was on the bench, sitting upright, his back against the wall. Rizal's expression was -- and this was the detail that Hafiz would remember later, the detail that would surface in the hours of 3 AM wakefulness for months and years afterward -- calm. Not shocked. Not distressed. The expression of a man sitting in a room where nothing unexpected had occurred.

Then the expression changed. Fast, professional, the way a mask was donned. The transformation took less than a second, and it was the performance of a man who had done this before.

"Oh God," Rizal said, his voice loud enough to carry through the observation slot. "Oh God, he -- I woke up and he was -- I tried to stop him but he was already--"

Rizal stood and moved to the body, his hands performing the choreography of attempted rescue -- pulling at the fabric, trying to lift the body.

"I tried," Rizal said, his voice cracking at precisely the right moment. "I tried to get him down but I couldn't -- the knot -- I couldn't--"

Hafiz closed the observation slot -- the hand's automatic response to the need to stop seeing.

He stood in the corridor. The corridor was twelve metres long and lit and empty and the body was on the other side of the steel door and the death was the thing that the RM5,000 had purchased.

The calculation was the calculation that all compromised people perform: he had taken the money, he had left the cells unguarded, the man was dead. The connection between these three facts was causal. If he had not taken the money, if he had not left, the man would be alive. The result: call for backup, follow the protocol, let the system process the event. Let the paperwork absorb the facts. Do not confess. Do not mention the money. Do not mention the text. Do not mention the forty minutes. Let the forty minutes become a break, a bathroom break, a scheduled interval that the log recorded and the protocol permitted.

Hafiz walked to the duty desk. He picked up the phone. He dialled the internal extension for the operations room.

"This is Guard Hafiz, cell block duty. I need backup at the cell block immediately. I have a prisoner -- Cell 7 -- he's... I think he's dead. I think he hanged himself."

The words came out in the voice that people used when reporting emergencies -- too loud, too fast, the shaking quality of a body in shock. The voice was not a performance. Hafiz was genuinely shocked. The gap between accepting RM5,000 and seeing a dead body was a gap that no amount of money could bridge, the gap between *something will happen* and *a man is hanging by a towel from a bar in Cell 7*.

"Guard Hafiz, confirm: prisoner deceased in Cell 7?"

"Yes. I just -- on my round, I looked through the slot and he's -- there's a towel, he's tied it to the bar, he's hanging. I need -- can you send someone?"

"Stay at your position. Backup is on the way."

The phone went down. He sat at the desk. He looked at the log, open to the page where he had written, seven minutes ago, *23:55 -- Returned to duty desk from break. All quiet.*

He picked up the pen and wrote:

*00:02 -- Routine round. Cell 7: discovered prisoner (foreign national, drug case) hanging from cell door bar by towel. Appears deceased. Called operations room for backup.*

The handwriting was unsteady. The letters were too large, the lines not straight, the pen pressing too hard into the paper. The unsteadiness was the physical record of the body's state -- the trembling that the voice had carried and that the hand now carried. The investigators who later examined the log would interpret the unsteadiness as the appropriate response of a guard who had discovered a death. They would not interpret it as the response of a guard who had been paid to enable one. Both interpretations were true. Both truths coexisted in the same trembling hand.

---

Backup arrived in four minutes. Three officers: Corporal Yusof from the operations room, Constable Lee from the front desk, and Sergeant Hamid, the duty officer who had, six hours earlier, received a phone call from a hostel owner named Razak who had warned that the prisoner in Cell 7 was in danger. Sergeant Hamid did not, at this moment, make the connection between the phone call and the body. The connection would be made later, in the morning, when the phone call was retrieved from the duty log and the connection became the kind of connection that produced investigations and the specific, terrible bureaucratic aftermath of a death that might have been prevented. But that was later.

Four men walked the corridor in single file toward Cell 7.

Hafiz opened Cell 7. The key turned, the lock opened, the door swung. The cell was three metres by three. The fluorescent light illuminated the scene with flat, democratic light -- every surface equally lit, every detail equally visible, no shadows to conceal. The light showed everything.

The body hung from the top bar of the cell door's barred section. The blue towel was knotted around the bar and around the neck. The body's knees were bent -- the bar was not high enough for a full suspension, and the body hung in the posture specific to partial-suspension hangings, the weight divided between the ligature and the floor, the knees bent, the feet near the ground, the body in a half-sitting, half-hanging configuration that the officers knew was consistent with suicide by hanging in environments where high anchor points were unavailable.

The body was Connor Briggs. Twenty-seven. Australian. Arrested that day on the North-South Expressway with 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in the lining of a suitcase. Charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. The charge carried a mandatory death penalty.

The face was congested -- the dusky, cyanotic hue that was distinct from the colour of living skin, the blood that entered through the deep arteries continuing to arrive while the compressed veins prevented its return. The tongue was partially protruded. The eyes were open, the conjunctivae showing petechial haemorrhages -- the tiny red dots present in both strangulation and hanging, confirming the mechanism without distinguishing between the two.

Corporal Yusof stepped forward and placed two fingers on the body's wrist. The wrist was cool. Not cold -- the body had not been dead long enough for full cooling, the thermal gradient proceeding at approximately 1 to 1.5 degrees per hour.

"No pulse," Yusof said. The words were for the record.

Sergeant Hamid looked at Rizal. Rizal was standing by his bench, his face carrying the expression of a man who had witnessed something terrible -- the visible, legible signs of emotional impact that the system's reports would describe as *the cellmate appeared visibly distressed*.

"What happened?" Hamid asked.

Rizal's voice was low, shaking, calibrated to the situation. "I was sleeping. On the bench. I don't know what time -- maybe eleven, maybe later. I woke up because I heard something. A sound. Like... a scraping sound. I opened my eyes and I saw him -- standing on the bench, tying the towel to the bar. I said 'Hey, what are you doing?' He didn't answer. I got up. I tried to stop him. I grabbed his legs. But he... he pushed me away. He kicked. And then he... he just leaned into it. He let go. And I couldn't hold him. He was heavy. I tried to pull the towel but the knot was tight. I shouted for the guard. I shouted. Nobody came."

The statement was a piece of craft -- the hesitations placed at the right moments, the repetitions serving the function of a distressed mind circling its own trauma, the details specific enough to be credible but vague enough on timing to preclude contradiction. The work of a man who had given this statement before, in other cells, about other bodies, with other details but the same structure, the same arc, the same conclusion: *I tried to stop him. I couldn't. Nobody came.*

"Nobody came," Hamid repeated.

"I shouted. I banged on the bars. Nobody came."

Hamid looked at Hafiz. The look contained a question without voicing it. Hafiz met the look, his face pale -- shock and guilt producing the same visible symptom.

"I was at the desk," Hafiz said. "I didn't hear anything. The door between the desk and the corridor, it's thick."

The statement did not mention the earbuds, the football highlights, the forty minutes, the text message, the RM5,000, the flat deposit, the girlfriend, the small quiet irreversible decision of a twenty-six-year-old man who had weighed two months' salary against the contents of a text message and had chosen the salary.

Hamid nodded -- the nod that said *noted* without saying *believed* or *doubted*.

"Seal the cell," Hamid said. "Nobody touches the body until the medical examiner arrives. Yusof, call the ME. Lee, start the notification chain. Hafiz, stay at the desk. Write everything in the log. Everything."

The word *everything* was the system's instruction. The word *everything* meant the things the system wanted recorded -- the times, the observations, the actions taken, the statements received. The word *everything* did not mean the RM5,000 or the forty minutes or the text message from the unknown number. The word *everything* meant the everything that fit the conclusion the system had already begun to reach: a man facing the death penalty had chosen to die on his own terms.

The conclusion was wrong. The conclusion had been designed by the people who had paid Rizal to kill and Hafiz to leave and who had left the towel in the cell knowing that protocol required the removal of all ligature-risk items, knowing that the failure to follow this protocol would be attributed to administrative oversight rather than deliberate facilitation, the failure that the report would note as a procedural lapse rather than a conspiracy.

The system did not know this. The system processed the inputs it was given. The inputs were: a body, a towel, a knot, a bar, a charge sheet, a cellmate's statement. The output was: suicide while in custody.

---

The medical examiner arrived at 1:15 AM.

His name was Dr. Rajan Subramaniam. Fifty-three years old. Twenty-one years a forensic pathologist. Over four thousand bodies examined. He had been woken at 12:40 AM and had driven from his house in Bangsar in thirty-five minutes, a drive that took twenty in daylight but longer now because Dr. Rajan drove slowly when called to a death in custody -- the slow driving was the time he used to transition from the domestic world, the wife sleeping, the jasmine in the garden that he could smell as he walked to the car, to the professional world of cells and bodies and the things that happened to human beings when they were held by systems.

The preliminary examination took twenty-two minutes.

He put on gloves. Male body, Caucasian, late twenties, hanging by a blue microfiber towel from the horizontal bar of the cell door. Partial suspension, knees bent, feet ten centimetres from the floor. Overhand knot on the bar, slipknot on the neck. Board shorts, tank top. One flip-flop on the left foot, the other on the floor near the bench.

He examined the ligature mark. The mark was consistent with hanging -- a V-shaped pattern, the point of the V at the back of the neck where the ligature pulled upward toward the anchor point, the arms of the V running along the sides of the neck toward the front where the towel compressed the throat. The mark was wide -- approximately five centimetres, consistent with the width of the folded microfiber towel. The mark was not deep. This was significant. Microfiber did not indent flesh the way a rope did, did not abrade the way a wire did. Microfiber compressed. The skin beneath the towel was reddened but not broken, the surface intact, the damage subcutaneous -- the crushed trachea, the compressed carotid arteries, the damage that killed without marking, the damage that a soft, smooth fabric inflicted differently from a hard, rough one.

He noted: no classic defensive wounds. No scratches on the hands or forearms consistent with fighting an attacker. No bruising on the arms consistent with being restrained. No abrasions on the neck consistent with the victim's own fingers clawing at a ligature. The absence was consistent with suicide -- the self-inflicted death did not produce defensive wounds because the victim was not defending against an external attacker.

The absence was also consistent with a specific type of homicide -- the homicide committed with a ligature that could not be gripped. In such a homicide, the victim's hands went to the throat and found no purchase on the smooth microfiber surface. The scratching of fingernails on microfiber left no mark on the skin because the fabric was between the fingers and the throat -- the barrier that prevented the victim from clawing his own neck in the way that victims of rope or wire strangulation did. The barrier meant that the absence of defensive wounds was not evidence of suicide but evidence of the specific physics of microfiber strangulation. The distinction was the distinction that separated murder from self-inflicted death. The distinction was invisible.

Dr. Rajan did not note this. He noted the absence of defensive wounds and recorded it as *consistent with self-inflicted ligature injury*. The recording was not negligence. The recording was the product of context -- a man found hanging in a cell with a charge sheet that said *mandatory death penalty*, the context in which suicide was not merely plausible but expected, in which the examination was a confirmation rather than an investigation. The system had already reached its conclusion and was now assembling the evidence that supported it -- confirmation bias operating not through malice but through efficiency, the pattern so familiar it had become the template into which evidence was fitted.

He took the body's temperature. Core temperature: 35.8 degrees Celsius. Ambient temperature of the cell: 24 degrees. Using the standard Henssge nomogram for cooling, accounting for the body's mass and clothing: estimated time of death approximately 90 to 120 minutes before the examination, placing the death between 11:15 PM and 11:45 PM. The estimate was consistent with the guard's account -- the last confirmed observation of the prisoner alive at 10:00 PM, the discovery at 12:02 AM. The estimate was also consistent with the forty-minute window that the RM5,000 had purchased, but Dr. Rajan did not know about the window, and the estimate confirmed rather than complicated the timeline.

He photographed the scene. Twenty-three photographs.

He bagged the towel. The towel was untied from the bar and from the neck with care -- the knots documented, the configuration recorded, the towel placed in a large brown paper evidence bag and sealed with red evidence tape and labelled: *Item 1: Blue microfiber towel (Sea to Summit brand), recovered from ligature position, Cell 7, Dang Wangi DPHQ, [date]*. The evidence bag was the towel's final container. The towel had been in a shop in Melbourne, in a suitcase, in a hostel, on beaches, in showers, in twelve countries, around a man's shoulders, around a man's neck, and now in a bag. The bag was the endpoint. The bag was where objects went when they stopped being possessions and became evidence.

On Form Pol. 61, Report of Death, Dr. Rajan wrote:

*Deceased found in partial suspension hanging from horizontal bar of cell door using blue microfiber towel. Ligature mark consistent with hanging. No defensive injuries observed. Rigor mortis: early onset. Lividity: consistent with position. Preliminary cause of death: asphyxia due to ligature compression of neck (hanging). Manner of death: pending investigation, consistent with suicide.*

Dr. Rajan spoke briefly with Sergeant Hamid in the corridor.

"Straightforward," he said. "Hanging. The towel served as the ligature. The full post-mortem will be at HKL tomorrow morning. But the preliminaries are clear."

"Suicide?" Hamid asked. The question was the binary determination that would activate one set of protocols or another -- the fork in the system's decision tree that determined whether Cell 7 was a death scene or a crime scene.

"That's for the coroner. But the scene is consistent. Man facing a capital charge. No signs of foul play. Cellmate's account matches the physical evidence."

"The towel," Hamid said. "Should it have been in the cell?"

Dr. Rajan looked at him. The question was the right question -- the question that, if pursued, would unravel the scene, the question of how a ligature-risk item came to be in a cell with a prisoner facing a capital charge.

"That's an administrative matter," Dr. Rajan said. "Not medical. Note it in your report."

Hamid would note it -- a single line recording the towel's presence in the cell as a procedural oversight, a lapse in the intake process. The note would not identify who had left the towel. The system's investigation would stop at the administrative level, where failures were systemic rather than individual, where blame was distributed across the institution rather than concentrated on a person.

The question of how the towel got into the cell would be asked, noted, and filed. It would not be answered.

---

At 1:45 AM, the notification chain began.

The chain was hierarchical, sequential, each notification triggering the next -- the death radiating outward from Cell 7 through the channels the system had constructed for exactly this purpose.

First notification: Dang Wangi District Commander. Superintendent Razlan bin Idris received the call at his home in Taman Tun Dr Ismail. He asked three questions: Was it suicide? Was there a witness? Was the prisoner foreign? The answers -- appears so, yes, yes (Australian) -- activated the foreign national protocol, the additional layer of notification that applied when the deceased was not Malaysian, the layer that involved embassies and consulates and the international dimension that converted a domestic death into a diplomatic event.

"Full report on my desk by six AM," Superintendent Razlan said. "And call the Australian High Commission."

The Australian High Commission's after-hours emergency line connected to Sarah Chen, Second Secretary (Consular), who had been asleep in her apartment in Mont Kiara and was now awake and writing on a notepad.

"Name: Connor James Briggs. Date of birth: [date]. Passport number: [number]. Arrested today, North-South Expressway. Charged under Section 39B, Dangerous Drugs Act. Found deceased in custody at approximately midnight. Preliminary cause of death: suicide by hanging."

Sarah Chen wrote the details. The writing was the beginning of the consular file -- the translation of the death from one bureaucratic language to another, from the language of the PDRM to the language of DFAT, from Form Pol. 61 to the consular notification form, from Bahasa Melayu to English, from one system to another.

"We'll need access to the body," Sarah said. "And all documentation. Full consular notification to Canberra goes out at oh-six-hundred."

"Understood."

"And the next-of-kin?"

"That's your department, ma'am."

"Yes. It is."

She looked at the name on the notepad. She had made four next-of-kin calls in her two years in KL. This would be her fifth, and the hardest -- the one that combined *your son is dead* with *your son was charged with drug trafficking*. The two facts arrived together, inseparable, the blow that killed the person the parents thought they knew twice -- once with the death, once with the revelation. That call was hours away.

The coroner's office was notified by fax -- a fax, in 2026, the technology that the Malaysian bureaucracy had not fully replaced, the paper record that accompanied the digital record. The fax contained the preliminary report and a cover sheet requesting a coroner's inquest. The fax would be read in the morning by a clerk who would assign a case number and a date, and the inquest would reach the conclusion that the fax's contents already suggested: suicide while in custody.

The prison medical service and SUHAKAM -- the Malaysian Human Rights Commission -- were notified in turn, each adding the death to their systems: a line in a table, a number in a statistic, the death converted from an event into a data point.

Each notification converted the death into a different language. In each language, the event was the same: a man died. In each language, the man was Connor James Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian -- a set of identifiers, a name on a form. The man was no longer a person. The man was an input that the system was processing.

---

At 2:30 AM, Rizal was moved to Cell 2. The move was procedural -- the cellmate removed from the scene, the cell preserved as a death scene. He walked the twelve metres of corridor with the hunched posture of a man in shock, maintaining the performance for the officers watching and the CCTV camera mounted at the corridor's end, its red light blinking every two seconds, recording the objective visual evidence that would show a man in the manner of a man who had been through a traumatic experience.

The door of Cell 2 closed. The lock turned. Alone, Rizal's face changed -- not dramatic, not the dropping of a mask. Subtle: the muscles around the eyes relaxing, the jaw unclenching, the shoulders settling. A body releasing the tension of performance. Rizal's default state was calm. The state of a man who had done a job and was now waiting for the job's consequences to process through the system.

He lay on the bench. The cell was identical to the cell he had left -- same dimensions, same materials, same light, same smell of disinfectant and concrete. The cells were all interchangeable. That was the nature of cells.

He closed his eyes and slept immediately -- the deep sleep of a body that had held a towel tight for three and a half minutes while a man struggled and kicked and then stopped. He slept for an hour.

At 4:15 AM, an officer opened Cell 2. Rizal was told he was being released. The assault charge was being dropped -- insufficient evidence, no complainant, the matter resolved. The paperwork was minimal: a release form signed by Superintendent Razlan, the return of personal effects from the property locker -- a wallet, a phone, keys. The release was not processed at the front desk, not through normal channels. The release was processed in the custody wing office by the night duty officer, who did not ask questions because Inspector Kamal's instructions were the instructions of a man who outranked everyone on the night shift and whose authority made things happen at hours when things did not normally happen.

An officer led him through the rear corridor to the service door, out into the warm, humid pre-dawn air of KL -- the equatorial climate that did not cool, did not offer the relief of temperate cities in their small hours.

Rizal walked across the car park. The car park was lit by sodium lamps, the orange light casting long shadows from the police vehicles parked in rows. He walked through the rear gate -- the gate that was supposed to be locked after midnight, the gate that someone had unlocked for this departure -- and onto Jalan Dang Wangi.

A silver Toyota Vios waited on the opposite kerb. Engine running. Headlights off. Registration plates removed.

Rizal crossed the street. He did not hurry. He opened the rear door, climbed in. The door closed. The Vios pulled away eastbound, past the mamak stalls still lit, the 7-Elevens glowing, the handful of people on the streets at this hour -- shift workers, taxi drivers, the insomniacs and the nocturnal commerce of a metropolis between its darkest hour and dawn.

In the back seat, Rizal pulled a pack of Gudang Garam cigarettes from his returned belongings. He lit one. The smoke filled the car. The driver said nothing. The city passed outside the windows -- Jalan Dang Wangi to Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, past the shuttered fabric shops and gold shops that would not open for hours -- and the man who had been in Cell 7 with him was in a body bag at Dang Wangi and would never ride through a pre-dawn city or smoke a cigarette or watch the sodium lights pass through a windscreen in the way that Rizal was watching them now.

Rizal finished the cigarette. He opened the window. He flicked the butt into the street. The ember bounced once on the asphalt and died.

He disappeared into KL. The Vios disappeared the way vehicles disappeared in a city of eight million -- not with drama or speed but with the ordinary absorption of traffic into traffic, the car becoming one of thousands, the registration-less plates invisible because there was no one looking, and the not-looking was the protection, and the protection was complete.

His name would appear in the cell log of Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters: *Rizal bin Yusof, Cell C-7, admitted [date] 21:45, released [date] 04:30, charge: assault (s. 323 Penal Code), disposition: no further action.* The name would appear nowhere else. No police report would mention him as a person of interest. No investigation would trace his movements after his release. No journalist would interview him. No court would call him. The name was in the log and the log was in the file and the file was in the system and the system was done with him.

The matter was not resolved. The matter was a dead man in Cell 7 and a living man in a silver Vios heading east through pre-dawn KL, and the distance between them growing with every kilometre.

---

By 6:00 AM, the report was on Superintendent Razlan's desk. Twelve pages, typed, single-spaced, on PDRM letterhead: *Report on Death in Custody: Connor James Briggs (Australian National), Dang Wangi DPHQ, [date].*

The report contained: the deceased's arrest and charges, a timeline of processing and detention, the guard's observation log, the cellmate's witness statement, the guard's statement, the medical examiner's preliminary findings, and twenty-three photographs.

The preliminary conclusion read:

*Based on the evidence gathered, the deceased, Connor James Briggs, appears to have committed suicide by hanging using a personal item (microfiber towel) while in custody at Dang Wangi DPHQ. The deceased had been charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which carries a mandatory death penalty. It is assessed that the deceased was despondent over the charges and the likely outcome. The death is consistent with suicide. No evidence of foul play has been identified at this stage. A full coroner's inquest will be convened to determine the official cause and manner of death.*

It was written quickly, efficiently, the way reports were written when the conclusion was predetermined. The phrases were the system's standard vocabulary for this type of death: *appears to have committed suicide*, *consistent with*, *no evidence of foul play*, *despondent over charges*. The phrases had been used before and would be used again. The phrases were not false. The phrases were incomplete.

The report did not mention that the towel should not have been in the cell. The report noted the towel's presence as a fact -- *the deceased was found hanging by a blue microfiber towel (Sea to Summit brand) that was among his personal effects at the time of detention* -- but did not note that protocol for prisoners charged with capital offences required the removal of all items that could be used as ligatures. The omission was the product of a report written by officers documenting the death rather than investigating the detention -- answering the question the system had asked rather than the question it had not.

It did not mention the guard's forty-minute absence. The guard's log showed a break from 23:15 to 23:55 -- the forty minutes recorded as a single word, *break*, the word that covered the forty minutes the way a towel covered a body, completely, neatly, with no edges showing.

Nowhere in its twelve pages did the text message or the RM5,000 appear. Hafiz's personal phone was not examined, was not seized, was not part of the investigation. In the report, Hafiz was a witness -- the guard who had been at his desk when a prisoner decided to die.

Superintendent Razlan read the report in eight minutes. The document was structurally sound. The evidence supported the conclusion. The conclusion was consistent with the circumstances. He signed it. The signature activated the report's distribution: copies to the coroner, to state police headquarters, to SUHAKAM, to the District Commander's file.

The report was now the official truth. The truth was: Connor James Briggs committed suicide while in custody, despondent over drug trafficking charges. The truth was twelve pages, typed, single-spaced, on PDRM letterhead, signed by the District Commander. The truth was in the system.

The other truth -- Rizal and the towel and the forty minutes and the RM5,000 and the text message from the unknown number and the network that had paid for the death and the protocol that silenced mules who talked -- the other truth was not in the system. The other truth was in a guard's phone, and in the memory of a cell that had been cleaned and would be occupied again by midday, and in the space between what happened and what the report said happened.

---

By noon, Cell 7 was clean. Mopped, wiped, scrubbed. The cleaning removed the scuff marks from flip-flops, the smudge of sweat on the bench, the faint smell of sunscreen that had clung to the air since the towel's arrival.

The cleaning did not remove the scratch on the bench's steel surface -- the scratch that said REAPER in letters small enough to miss, letters carved by a hand that was not Connor's and not Rizal's, letters that had been there before and would be there after. The only mark in the cell that outlasted the cleaning. The only mark the system could not scrub.

At 12:15 PM, a new prisoner was admitted to Cell 7. A Malaysian man, twenty-two, arrested for theft from a tourist at KLCC. The man entered the cell. He sat on the bench. He looked at the fluorescent light. He looked at the walls. He looked at the bars. He did not know that a man had died in this cell thirteen hours ago. He did not know that the bench he was sitting on had held a body now at Hospital Kuala Lumpur being prepared for autopsy. He did not know that the bar above the door had held a blue towel and a weight of seventy-eight kilograms and the last moments of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had carried packages for a man named Felix and had told everything to a man named Rizal and had thought about his mother as the light went out.

The new prisoner knew only the cell -- the light, the bench, the walls, the bars, the smell of disinfectant. The cell was clean and lit and ready for the next input.

Somewhere in the system -- in a file, in a form, in a bag, in a photograph -- the record of Connor James Briggs existed, processed, categorised, filed: *suicide while in custody*.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The cell waited.
