# Chapter 4: The Crew

The rooftop of The Lantern Hostel had no business being anyone's idea of a good time. Five plastic chairs arrayed around a plywood table held steady by a folded beer coaster. A clothesline sagged between two poles, heavy with the damp ghosts of traveler laundry: elephant-print harem pants, a sports bra faded to the color of dishwater, someone's cargo shorts pinned by a single clip and rotating slowly like a weathervane nobody needed. The railing was a waist-high strip of corrugated zinc that inspired confidence in absolutely no one.

But the view.

The Petronas Towers framed between shophouse roofs and a chaos of electrical wire so dense it looked like the city's nervous system turned inside out. The towers stood silver and alien against the dark, twin needles of money and ambition punching through the orange murk of light pollution. Below, Petaling Street hummed -- motorbike engines, hawker vendors, the bass-note vibrations from Changkat three blocks east. The air was warm and thick and smelled of exhaust and incense and, beneath that, the sulfurous breath of the open drains.

Connor leaned against the zinc railing with a Tiger beer sweating in his hand and thought: *This is going on the grid.*

He held up his phone and framed the shot -- the towers between the wires, the red glow of the hostel's lanterns bleeding up from below. He took four photos, selected the best, applied a filter that deepened the reds and cooled the sky to a moody indigo, and saved it to drafts. Caption later. Something about perspective. His 4,200 followers -- about five K, if anyone asked -- would eat it up.

"Connor! My man!"

Jake Porter emerged through the rooftop access door like a golden retriever who'd heard a treat bag rustle. Backwards cap, surf brand singlet stretched across his stocky sunburned frame, a grin so wide it was almost a medical condition. He was carrying two cans of Tiger in each hand, pressed against his chest like he was rescuing them from a building fire.

"Dude, Felix said drinks are on the roof. I brought supplies."

"Legend," Connor said. Jake was exactly the kind of person Connor understood on a cellular level: easygoing, up for anything, never asking difficult questions. They'd bonded in under twenty minutes on Connor's first night, and in the hostel economy of instant friendship, that was practically a blood oath.

Jake dropped into a plastic chair that screamed under his weight and cracked a Tiger with practiced ceremony. "So Felix organized this whole thing? Like, he just decided we're all going out?"

"That's Felix, mate. Man's a social architect."

"A what?"

"He just -- he makes things happen. You know? Some people talk about doing stuff, Felix just does it."

Jake nodded with the gravity of someone receiving wisdom. "Totally. He's like, the guy, you know? Every hostel has one."

They clinked cans. The beer was lukewarm but Connor didn't care. The night was happening. He could feel it the way you feel weather coming in -- a charge in the air, a loosening of constraints, the city below rearranging itself into possibility.

Priya arrived next, and Connor could tell from the way she climbed through the access door that she'd already had the argument with herself and lost.

She was dressed practically, as always -- jeans rolled at the ankle, a plain navy top, trainers that had actually been laced properly. Her battered Lonely Planet guide was not in evidence, which for Priya constituted going wild. She pushed her round glasses up her nose and surveyed the rooftop with the expression of someone inspecting a crime scene.

"I can only stay for one drink," she announced to no one in particular. "I have an early start tomorrow. I'm doing the Batu Caves at seven."

"Priya!" Connor stood, spread his arms. "You came! See, I told Jake you'd come."

"You said she wouldn't," Jake said.

"I said she *might* not, which is basically the same as saying she would. Sit down. Drink. The Batu Caves aren't going anywhere -- they've been there for, what, four hundred million years?"

"The limestone, yes. The temples are about a hundred and forty years old." She sat in the plastic chair Connor pulled out for her, accepted the beer he pressed into her hand with minimal resistance. "One drink."

"One drink," Connor agreed, already knowing it would be more.

A Swedish couple appeared -- Astrid and Erik, tall and blonde and so symmetrically attractive they looked like they'd been cast by a Scandinavian tourism board. Then Min-ho, a Korean guy from Dorm 1 who spoke minimal English but communicated entirely through enthusiastic thumbs-ups and an encyclopedic knowledge of drinking games. The rooftop filled with voices and the percussion of cracking cans and the warm, electric hum of people who'd known each other for less than forty-eight hours but were, by the transient mathematics of hostel life, already a family.

Connor noticed the woman sitting apart.

She was on the far side of the rooftop, perched on a plastic crate near the clothesline. Short. Athletic. Hair cropped close to her skull, the tips dyed a dark red that caught the lantern light like embers. Multiple piercings climbed the cartilage of her left ear -- silver studs and tiny hoops, precise as Morse code. In her hands was a camera that was not a tourist's camera. Heavy, black, professional-grade -- the kind of equipment that cost more than Connor's entire travel fund.

"Who's that?" he asked Jake.

"Oh, her? That's Tomoko. Japanese. She's in the premium dorm, I think. Keeps to herself."

Connor watched her for a moment. She moved the camera with an economy of motion that suggested thousands of hours of practice -- no wasted gestures, no fumbling with settings, just the smooth pivot of someone who saw the world through a viewfinder as naturally as breathing.

He walked over, beer in hand, smile deployed.

"Hey! I'm Connor. You're Tomoko, yeah?"

She lowered the camera. Her eyes were dark, steady, weighted -- the eyes of someone who had learned to see things other people chose not to see.

"Yes."

"Sick camera. You a photographer?"

"Photojournalist."

"Oh, rad. Like, for a magazine?"

"Sometimes."

Connor waited for her to elaborate. She didn't.

"Cool, well -- we're all heading out to Changkat tonight. You should come. Felix is organizing it. He knows all the spots."

At the name Felix, something shifted in her expression. Not quite a flinch. More like a door closing behind a window -- the light changed but you couldn't say exactly how.

"The German," she said.

"Yeah. You've met him?"

"Briefly."

"He's a legend. The guy knows everyone in KL."

Tomoko looked at him with an expression he couldn't read. "Have a good night, Connor."

She raised the camera back to her eye and turned toward the skyline. Connor stood there for a moment, dismissed, then walked back to the group with a shrug.

"She's a bit intense," he told Jake.

"Right? I tried to talk to her about surfing and she just, like, looked at me."

*Unfriendly,* Connor decided, and the word slotted neatly into his mental filing system. Friendly. Unfriendly. Useful. Not useful. Fun. Not fun. Tomoko: not fun. He put her away and opened another beer.

Felix arrived at nine o'clock, and it was like the volume on the rooftop went up.

He came through the access door with a bottle of duty-free Hendrick's gin in one hand and a bag of limes in the other, and the rooftop rearranged itself around him like metal filings around a magnet. White linen shirt that should have been wrinkled but wasn't. Dark linen shorts. Leather sandals. When the red lantern light hit the thin scar on his left eyebrow it gave him the faintest suggestion of danger, which is to say, exactly the right amount.

"Good evening, everyone," Felix said, and he said it the way he said everything -- calmly, warmly, with the soft German accent rounding the consonants into something musical. "Gin and tonics on me. Who has ice?"

Nobody had ice. This didn't matter. Felix produced a plastic bag of ice cubes from behind his back like a stage magician and the rooftop erupted -- the full-throated cheer of people who are already two beers in and have just been promised free spirits.

He made the drinks himself, slicing limes with a Swiss Army knife, remembering everyone's name as he handed them their glasses. "Priya, a little less tonic? Jake, extra lime for you. Astrid, Erik -- skol. Min-ho, I added some cucumber."

*He remembers everything,* Connor thought. *Everyone's name, everyone's preference. That's a superpower.*

When Felix reached Connor, he poured a generous gin with the ease of a man who had never checked a price tag. "Connor. Ready for tonight?"

"Born ready, mate."

"I know a place on Changkat. Rooftop bar, fourth floor, best view of the city. The owner owes me a favor." He said this casually, like it was nothing, like everyone had bar owners in Kuala Lumpur who owed them favors. "We start there. Then we see where the night takes us."

"That's the attitude."

Felix's smile widened fractionally. He leaned in, lowered his voice, though not low enough that it felt secretive -- just intimate. "I want you to have a good night, Connor. You deserve it. You've been working hard."

Connor had not been working hard at anything, unless drinking Tiger beers and filming Instagram stories qualified. But the flattery landed like a warm hand on his shoulder, and he felt -- genuinely felt -- that Felix saw something in him that other people missed. Something worth investing in.

From the far side of the rooftop, Tomoko watched over the top of her camera. The shutter clicked once, twice, and then she lowered the lens and watched with her own eyes. Her expression was unreadable.

Priya, near the clothesline, watched Felix too. She watched the way he distributed drinks and attention with the precision of someone dealing cards, the way each person leaned toward him, postures opening like flowers. She felt something she couldn't quite name: not jealousy, not suspicion exactly, but a dissonance, like a note played slightly flat in an otherwise perfect chord. Real generosity has friction -- awkwardness, miscalculation. Felix never miscalculated. Felix was frictionless.

She pushed her glasses up and took a sip of her drink, which was, in fact, exactly how she liked it.

---

Changkat Bukit Bintang hit Connor's senses like a slap.

The nightlife strip ran uphill through a corridor of converted shophouses, each one bleeding light and noise into the tropical night. Neon signs -- blue, pink, green, electric orange -- competed along facades draped with string lights. Bass lines from competing sound systems collided in the air, a dissonant heartbeat you felt in your sternum before you heard it. The smell was cocktail garnish and charcoal satay smoke and perfume and sweat. Bodies everywhere -- tourists, locals, expats -- all flowing in the same direction: further in, deeper, louder.

"This," Connor said, walking backward so he could film the street on his phone, "is absolutely mental."

He was already recording. The Instagram story would be iconic: neon-soaked street, bass thumping, Connor's face appearing in frame with a grin that said *are you seeing this?* He added a location tag and a caption: "Tuesday night in KL hits different." He didn't mention it was Wednesday.

Felix led them up the street like a man who owned it, past the first three bars without a glance, past the touts offering two-for-one cocktails, past a bouncer at a reggae bar who called out "Welcome, welcome!" to anyone with a pulse. At a narrow doorway between a Thai restaurant and a cocktail bar, he spoke to a man in a black polo shirt. The man looked at Felix, nodded, and unclipped the velvet rope.

"VIP entrance," Felix said. "Elevator to the roof."

They arrived at a rooftop bar that was everything The Lantern's rooftop was not. Real furniture. Actual cocktails. A DJ playing deep house. The Petronas Towers close enough that their spire-points seemed to scratch the low clouds, lit from within like the bones of something luminous.

"Oh my God," Priya said, and she said it without irony.

Felix guided them to the best table and ordered a round. The cocktails arrived with elaborate garnishes: kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass stalks, thin slices of torch ginger flower. This was RM45 a drink. Connor did the math and then immediately stopped doing the math.

"To the crew," Felix said, raising his glass. The group repeated it: the crew. Connor clinked his glass against Priya's and caught her eye and felt the night rearrange itself around them.

They moved through Changkat the way Felix moved through everything: smoothly, inevitably. A cocktail bar in a converted colonial house. A live music venue where a Filipino cover band played "Hotel California" with more conviction than the Eagles ever had. A hole-in-the-wall club where the DJ played Afrobeats and the dance floor was so packed you moved by consensus rather than choice.

At each stop, Felix knew someone. The bartender at the cocktail bar -- "Felix! Long time, brother!" -- poured extra-strong drinks and waved away his money (Felix left a crisp RM50 note under his glass anyway, precise and uncreased). The doorman at the club put them at the front of the line with a handshake that lingered. A waitress at the live music venue brought complimentary satay and whispered something in Felix's ear that made him smile.

Connor noticed. He noticed Felix paid for everything in cash -- crisp ringgit notes in denominations that suggested either a very good ATM or a very different source. Never a card. Never a bill. Never a hesitation. The man moved through the financial world the way water moves through rock: around every obstacle, leaving no trace.

*Where does his money come from?*

The thought surfaced and submerged, drowned by the next drink, the bass drop, Jake attempting to moonwalk and wiping out into a group of German tourists who turned out to be from Felix's hometown and suddenly there were shots being ordered and Connor was filming it all, phone held high, capturing chaos for the grid.

His Instagram story by midnight was nine slides long. A neon sign. A cocktail close-up. Connor and Jake with their arms around each other, mouths open in a synchronised shout. The Petronas Towers from the rooftop bar. A blurred dance floor. Each one captioned with performative casualness: "KL nightlife is no joke," "This crew tho," "If you know, you know."

Nobody back home knew. That was the point. The stories existed to create envy in people who would never be here, doing this, living like this. Connor was curating a life, frame by frame, and the fact that he was three months behind on his credit card and his "digital nomad" income last month totaled $47 AUD was a detail that existed in a different file, one he kept closed.

Priya loosened up around the third bar. The gin had softened the edges of her caution and the music had found its way past her resistance. She danced -- self-conscious at first, then less so, then not at all. On the packed floor of the Afrobeats club she moved with a natural rhythm that surprised Connor, and when he danced toward her she didn't move away. They danced together in the crush of bodies, laughing at nothing, at the absurdity of being here, at the heat that prickled their skin, at the sheer volume of being alive in a city that didn't know their names.

There was a moment -- brief, genuine -- where their faces were close and the laughter stopped and something else was there. Not lust, not yet, but recognition. Priya's eyes behind her glasses, dark and clear and seeing him.

Then Jake crashed between them with a bucket of beer from a street vendor and the moment dissolved, and Connor thought: *This is the content. This is the story I came here to live.*

At the bar, Felix watched them. His gin and tonic was barely touched. His face, when the strobe lights caught it, was difficult to categorize. Not happiness, though it neighbored happiness. Not predatory, though it bordered on assessment. The expression of a chess player watching pieces move to positions he'd anticipated three moves ago.

He caught the bartender's eye. Another round. The crisp RM50 notes appeared and disappeared.

---

By one-thirty, Connor had spent RM250.

He knew this because he'd checked his banking app in the bathroom of the third or fourth bar, forehead against cool tile while the room performed a slow rotation around him. The number was smaller than it should have been, and for a moment the pleasant fog of alcohol thinned and he saw the mathematics of his life with horrible clarity.

Current balance: RM1,847. Roughly $580 AUD. His parents' next deposit was ten days away. At this rate he'd be broke in less than two weeks.

He closed the app. Opened Instagram. Forty-three likes on his stories. Three new followers, two of them bots.

*She'll be right. Something will come up.*

The night fractured after two AM. The Swedes peeled away with polite European goodbyes, their arms around each other's waists. Min-ho had vanished into a group of Korean travelers. Jake was at the end of the bar, deep in conversation with a British girl named Gemma or Jemma who was traveling alone and had the bright, open face of someone who hadn't yet learned that Jake's stories about surfing Pipeline were exaggerated by a factor of roughly ten.

Priya had found Connor in the crowd, put her hand on his arm, leaned close to his ear: "I'm going. Early start. Don't do anything stupid." She'd lingered long enough for him to feel the warmth of her breath, the faint trace of her perfume cutting through the smoke and sweat, and then she was gone, and the space she'd occupied felt briefly colder.

Which left Connor and Felix.

They ended up at a rooftop bar four stories above Changkat, a place you had to know existed. Unmarked door, staircase that smelled of concrete dust. But the bar was open-air, low couches and candles in glass jars, the Petronas Towers close enough to see the skybridge connecting them, lit from within, a bridge between two pillars of money.

Felix ordered two whiskeys. They arrived in heavy tumblers with a single ice sphere.

"You had a good night, Connor," Felix said. It wasn't a question.

"Mate, that was one of the best nights of my life. And I've had some big ones. There was this one time in Koh Phangan--"

"But you're not really here for parties, are you?"

Connor paused, his drink halfway to his mouth. "What do you mean?"

Felix gazed out at the towers. "Most backpackers come to Asia to escape," he said. "But they bring their whole world with them. Their rules. Their fears. Their need to turn everything into a photograph." He glanced at Connor's phone. "They never actually leave home."

"I mean, yeah. I've seen that. Definitely."

"The ones who sit in Western cafes, eating Western food, talking to other Western people. They fly ten thousand kilometers to re-create the life they had. They change the backdrop but they keep the frame."

Connor nodded, though he wasn't entirely sure which side of that equation he was on. "Totally. That's what I always say."

Felix turned to look at him. The scar on his eyebrow caught the light. "You're different, Connor. You're adaptable. Most people say they want freedom but what they really want is permission. You don't need that. I noticed it the first night we talked."

The whiskey was warm in Connor's chest and the compliment was warmer. Felix had a way of articulating things Connor felt about himself but couldn't quite express. It was like having a mirror that showed not your reflection but your best self.

"I've been on the road for four years," Connor said. "Not a gap year. Four actual years. The only way to do it is to let go. Stop planning. Just let the next thing happen."

"Exactly." Felix's voice was soft. "And the next thing always happens, doesn't it?"

"Always."

They drank. The city below was a river of light and exhaust and the distant sound of a hundred different musics playing simultaneously. Somewhere a motorcycle engine whined. A siren rose and fell. The humidity sat on Connor's skin like a second shirt.

"I should head back," Connor said, and reached for his phone. He opened the banking app out of the automatic masochism of someone who already knew what the number would say. The screen glowed in the dark. The number stared at him.

RM1,847. And he'd been drinking since eight.

No. He refreshed. RM1,597. The pending transactions had posted. RM250 gone in a single night. A night that had felt like freedom and looked, on his banking app, like a countdown.

He must have made a face, because Felix said: "Money problems?"

Connor locked his phone. "Nah. All good, mate. Just -- doing the maths."

"The maths are never kind at this hour."

"She'll be right. I've got some freelance stuff coming in."

He didn't have any freelance stuff coming in. His one client -- a surf shop in Torquay that paid him $150 a month to manage their Instagram -- had emailed last week asking if he could "do more for the same rate." He hadn't replied. He wasn't going to reply.

Felix sipped his whiskey. He let the silence do its work -- and Felix was good at silence, Connor noticed, the way some people are good at music. He wielded it. The candle between them flickered in a breeze that carried the smell of charcoal and jasmine from the street below.

"I meant what I said about the logistics work," Felix said, his tone conversational, the same tone he'd use to recommend a restaurant. "RM200 for twenty minutes. That was a real offer, Connor."

"Yeah, no, I remember. What exactly--"

"Simple courier work. Import consulting. Documents, electronics samples. I have a driver but some contacts prefer a friendly face." He smiled. "You have a very friendly face."

"RM200 for twenty minutes."

"Sometimes less. You could do it every day. That's twelve hundred a week, more than your hostel costs."

The numbers arranged themselves with the seductive clarity of alcohol and desperation. RM1,200 a week. More than his parents sent him monthly. Staying in KL for months. Never checking his banking app at two AM and feeling the floor tilt.

"I mean," Connor said, "that sounds..."

"Think about it." Felix stood, left two RM50 notes on the table -- more than the bill required -- and buttoned his linen shirt at the cuff with the precision of a man who attended to details the way other people attended to breathing. "No pressure. But you know where to find me."

He offered his hand. Connor shook it. Felix's grip was dry and firm and lasted exactly the right amount of time.

"Good night, Connor."

"Night, mate."

Felix left. Connor finished his whiskey and watched the Petronas Towers standing in the dark like a challenge, or a promise, or a headstone for something that hadn't died yet.

---

The common room of The Lantern Hostel at three AM was a place of residual warmth and abandoned intention. Mismatched furniture casting crooked shadows under the single fluorescent tube Razak kept on all night. The bookshelf of abandoned novels -- dog-eared Lonely Planets, water-damaged thrillers, a copy of *Shantaram* so swollen with humidity it looked pregnant. The ancient Dell humming in the corner like something dreaming.

Tomoko Sato sat cross-legged on the couch with her laptop, uploading photographs. The Nikon D850's SD card held 847 images, already culled to sixty-three in her head. Tomoko did not take photographs indiscriminately. Every frame was a decision.

The images scrolled: the rooftop, the lantern glow, Changkat in neon excess. Good images. Professional. The kind that would make her editor at The Guardian nod.

But she wasn't looking for those.

She scrolled past landscapes and street scenes until she found the sequence from the first bar. She'd been at the edge of the group, camera on the table, shooting through the gap between a candle and a drink menu.

She found the frame.

Felix and Connor. Felix's hand on Connor's shoulder -- a casual gesture, the kind that said *I'm your friend.* But to Tomoko's eye, not casual at all. Guiding. Directing. The way a handler touches an asset.

In the foreground, Connor leaned in, mouth open, his expression the open enthusiasm of a man who has found his favourite person in the room. Over Connor's shoulder, Felix was looking at him. And the expression on Felix's face was not friendship.

It was assessment.

The clinical attention of someone evaluating a tool. What is this person worth? What can this person carry? How far can this person be pushed before they break?

Tomoko zoomed in. Felix's eyes, caught by strobe light, were perfectly steady. No alcohol blur. Stone sober in a bar full of drunk people, watching Connor the way a spider watches a fly that has just touched the web.

She saved the photo to a separate folder on her desktop. The folder was labeled, in Japanese, with two characters that translated roughly to "watch closely." She opened a text file inside the folder. Three entries already -- notes from previous nights, logged with the precision of field reportage.

She typed:

*Night 4. The German. Changkat. Cash only, high denominations. Knows staff at multiple venues. Avoids cameras. Hand-on-shoulder with the Australian -- guided conversation, controlled body language. Expression when unobserved: evaluative, not social.*

She paused. Added:

*The Australian trusts him completely.*

She closed the laptop. Through the air well, the hostel breathed -- creaking wood, a cough from an upper-floor dorm.

She thought about saying something to Connor. She could show him the photograph. She could say: look at the way this man looks at you. Look at his eyes. But she had tried, on the rooftop, in the way she tried things -- economically, without force. She'd offered a door. He'd walked away and called her unfriendly, or something equivalent. She'd heard the dismissal in his tone the way she heard most things people tried to hide: clearly.

Tomoko had been a journalist long enough to know that people who don't want to see will not be shown. They will look at evidence and see coincidence. They will look at a man measuring them for a coffin and see a friend buying drinks.

She saved the file. Created a backup on her phone.

Then she went to bed.

---

Dorm 3 was dark and close and smelled of Tiger Balm and damp and the particular musk of six strangers sleeping in a room designed for two. The ceiling fan turned with its metronomic click -- *tick, tick, tick* -- stirring the air without cooling it. Through the narrow opening to the air well, the sounds of KL filtered in as a distant murmur: the city's breathing, its three AM pulse.

Connor climbed into Bed 7 with the careful deliberation of a man drunker than he wants to admit. Flip-flops and singlet removed; the board shorts stayed because the coordination required exceeded his operational capacity. The thin mattress -- vinyl-covered foam, body-temperature, sticky against his bare back -- received him with indifferent resignation.

The room spun. Not violently, not the full carousel of real drunkenness, but the slow tilt of a ship in a mild swell. He closed his eyes and opened them again. The underside of the bunk above him was covered in stickers -- surf brands, band logos, a peeling Che Guevara, a scratched-off Hostelworld badge. In the dark they were just shapes, hieroglyphics left by previous occupants in a language of allegiance and memory.

*Tick, tick, tick.* The ceiling fan.

He picked up his phone. The screen brightness hit his eyes like a flash and he fumbled to dim it. Three seventeen AM. A WhatsApp from Jake: "dude gemma is so cool we're at some after party where are you." A missed call from his sister Megan. He would not return it.

He opened his banking app.

RM1,597.

The number sat on the screen with the blunt authority of a verdict. He stared at it. Eleven days until his parents' deposit. Eleven days of hostel fees (RM495), food (RM300 minimum, more if he kept eating out), transport, water, the occasional beer. He was RM200 short at a minimum, and that was if he ate instant noodles and drank nothing and went nowhere and became, effectively, the kind of traveler he despised: the one counting coins and choosing between lunch and a museum ticket.

He thought about Felix's offer.

RM200. Twenty minutes. The framing made sense in the way things make sense at three AM when you're drunk and broke and the alternative is admitting that the entire architecture of your life is built on parental subsidy and willful ignorance.

He could do that every day and never worry about money again. He could stay in KL for months. Self-funded, self-sufficient, free in the way that mattered. Free in the way that his parents' monthly deposit, with its invisible string of guilt, could never make him.

He opened WhatsApp. Found Felix's name. Typed:

*That logistics thing.*

Three dots blinked. The cursor waited.

He looked at the words. They sat in the text field like a dare.

It was an opening, not a commitment. He could send it and see what Felix said and then decide. No pressure. Just information gathering. The kind of thing a smart person would do.

He put his phone down.

He picked it up again.

*That logistics thing.*

His thumb hovered over the send arrow. The blue triangle pointed right, pointing forward, pointing toward something that had no name yet but already had momentum.

He didn't send it.

But he didn't delete it either.

He put the phone face-down on the mattress. His hand found the edge of his travel towel, bunched at the foot of the bed -- the bright blue Sea to Summit microfiber he'd bought four years ago on Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, two days before his first flight to Bali. Twelve countries. It smelled of sunscreen and the South China Sea. He pulled it over his chest like a thin, inadequate blanket.

The ceiling fan clicked. *Tick, tick, tick.*

Through the air well, Kuala Lumpur hummed: distant, patient, indifferent. A city that would not notice if Connor James Briggs stayed or left or lived or died.

He closed his eyes. The room swayed. The unsent message waited.

The decision was already made. He just hadn't admitted it yet.
