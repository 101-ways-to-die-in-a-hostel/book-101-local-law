# Chapter 48: The Next One

Six weeks later, the Lantern Hostel was open.

This is how quickly the world forgets: six weeks. Six weeks between Connor Briggs dying in a holding cell and the return to normalcy at the building where he had lived for forty-seven days and slept in Bed 7 and eaten nasi lemak and carried packages and loved a woman and ignored the warnings and done all the things that a living person did in a building that housed the living until the living became the dead and the building continued without them.

Six weeks. In six weeks, the investigation had moved from the hostel to the courts. The media had moved from the hostel to the next story. The guests had moved from avoidance to curiosity to indifference. The Hostelworld reviews had moved from one-star warnings ("Someone DIED here, avoid!!!") to three-star qualifications ("Heard about the incident but the hostel seems fine now, good nasi lemak") to the standard four-star assessments that made no mention of death at all ("Great location, friendly staff, would stay again, wifi is a bit slow").

The world forgot. This was not cruelty. This was the world's mechanism for continuing -- catastrophe into history, history into amnesia, amnesia into a hostel listing on a booking website: THE LANTERN HOSTEL. RM35-85/NIGHT. FREE BREAKFAST. WIFI. WALKING DISTANCE TO PETALING STREET. 7.6/10 (352 REVIEWS).

The rating had dropped from 7.8 to 7.6. Two tenths of a point. That was the quantified cost of Connor Briggs's death on the hostel's commercial viability -- two tenths of a rating point, the aggregate effect of twelve one-star reviews posted in the weeks after the news broke, diluted by the three hundred and forty reviews that preceded them and the steady accumulation of new reviews from new guests who did not know or did not care about the death that had made the building temporarily famous and was now making it famous for something else, which was the same thing it had always been famous for, which was the nasi lemak and the red lanterns and the location and the view of the Petronas Towers from the rooftop.

The hostel was open. The beds were full. The ceiling fans turned. Mama Siti cooked. Mei Ling manned the reception. Razak was absent -- Razak had stepped back from daily operations, his role in the investigation requiring his presence at police stations and lawyers' offices more than at the hostel he owned. A temporary manager, a young man named Hafizul who had previously managed a hostel in George Town, handled the bookings and the complaints and the daily business of keeping forty-two beds occupied and the building functional.

The investigation continued in the background, the way investigations did -- slowly, bureaucratically, through the accumulation of documents and the scheduling of hearings and the procedural choreography of a legal system that moved at the speed of paperwork rather than the speed of grief. Wei was in remand at Sungai Buloh, cooperating, his testimony building the case file page by page. Hafiz, the guard, had been arrested and charged with accepting a bribe and facilitating a homicide. Felix Decker was the subject of an international warrant issued through Interpol, the warrant circulating through the law enforcement databases of twelve countries, the warrant a digital ghost pursuing a physical man who was, according to the intelligence, operating out of a hostel in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a country with which Malaysia had an extradition treaty that was, like many extradition treaties, easier to invoke than to execute.

The story was in the courts. The story was in the Star's archive, searchable but no longer front-page. The story was on Tomoko's Instagram, where her photographs had been viewed 4.7 million times and shared by accounts with names like @TrueCrimeDaily and @BackpackerSafety and @JusticeForConnor. The story was on the #JusticeForConnor hashtag, which had trended for nine days and then declined in the way that all hashtags declined -- not because the cause became less just but because the algorithm moved on and the algorithm was the arbiter of attention and the attention span of the internet was measured in news cycles and the news cycles were measured in days and the days had passed.

Connor's parents had taken his body home. The repatriation had taken eleven days -- eleven days of consular paperwork and morgue releases and embalming procedures and flight arrangements and the grinding bureaucracy of moving a dead body across international borders, the bureaucracy that required certificates and permissions and the payment of fees that were the administrative cost of death, the invoices that arrived in the mailbox of a house in Hawthorn while the occupants of the house were in a state of grief that made the opening of mail an act of superhuman effort.

Connor was buried in a cemetery in Kew, three suburbs from the house where he'd grown up. The funeral was attended by two hundred people -- family, friends from school, his mother's medical colleagues, his father's business associates, the community of Hawthorn that had known the Briggs family for thirty years and that attended the funeral not because they had known Connor well (many had not seen him since he was a teenager) but because the funeral was the community's ritual of acknowledgement, the collective recognition that a member of the community's extended family had been lost and the loss required the physical presence of bodies in a chapel and the speaking of words and the lowering of a coffin into ground that was, in a different hemisphere and a different climate, the same ground -- the earth, the dirt, the surface of a planet that received bodies without distinction.

The funeral was over. The investigation continued. The hostel was open.

And on a Tuesday evening, six weeks and two days after Connor Briggs died, a young man walked through the narrow door between the phone repair shop (still closed, the shutters down, the sign dark) and the Chinese medicine store (open, smelling of dried herbs and ginseng), and entered the Lantern Hostel.

---

His name was Oliver. Oliver Price. British. Twenty-four. From Croydon, which he described as "South London" because South London sounded better than Croydon, the same way "digital nomad" sounded better than "unemployed" and "gap year" sounded better than "running away."

He had arrived that morning on an AirAsia flight from Bangkok, fleeing the slow realisation that the money was running out and the thing he'd come to find -- "myself" or "perspective" or "the real world" -- remained unfound and the looking was becoming indistinguishable from the avoidance of everything he'd left behind: a job, a relationship, a flat, a life that had ceased to feel like a life.

He was tall, thin, pink-skinned, wearing a T-shirt from a hostel in Chiang Mai and carrying a battered Osprey covered in patches.

He rang the bell.

Mei Ling appeared. Mei Ling looked at Oliver the way Mei Ling looked at every new guest -- with the practised assessment of a receptionist who had checked in thousands of young travellers and had developed, over those thousands of check-ins, an instinct for categorisation. She categorised Oliver in approximately four seconds: British, broke, solo, between things. The category was the most common category. The category was the hostel's primary demographic. The category was Connor.

"Checking in?" Mei Ling said.

"Yeah. I booked online. Oliver Price."

Mei Ling consulted the screen. The booking system was the same booking system that had processed Connor's reservation six weeks and forty-nine days earlier. The system was digital. The system did not remember Connor. The system remembered data -- names, dates, bed assignments, payment methods -- and the data was stored in a database on a server in Singapore and the server did not know that one of the names in the database was the name of a dead man and the bed assignment attached to that name was the bed on which the dead man had slept.

"Passport, please."

Oliver handed over his passport. British. Issued in London. The photograph showed a younger, cleaner Oliver -- the photograph taken in a booth at Croydon station eighteen months ago, the face the face of a man who had not yet been to Southeast Asia and had not yet lost the girlfriend and the job and the flat. The face was recognisable but altered, the way all passport photographs became altered by the time they were used for the purpose for which they were taken, the face a historical document, a record of who the holder had been when the document was issued, not who the holder was now.

Mei Ling photocopied the passport. She entered the information into the system. She assigned a bed.

"Bed 7, Dorm 3. Second floor, end of the corridor, bottom bunk on the left."

The bed number arrived in the air between them and settled. Mei Ling did not flinch. Mei Ling had assigned Bed 7 fourteen times since the hostel reopened. Fourteen guests in six weeks, the turnover rate the standard turnover rate for a budget hostel in a major tourist city, two to four nights per guest, the guests arriving and departing and the bed receiving and releasing bodies with the regularity of a system that was designed for exactly this -- the temporary housing of transient people, the provision of a surface on which to sleep for a price that was the price of a meal in a mid-range restaurant, the transaction so minor and so routine that the assignment of the specific bed on which a man had slept before being murdered was, to the system, unremarkable.

"WiFi password's on the board," Mei Ling said. "Breakfast is seven to ten. Kitchen's communal. Quiet after eleven. You'll need your own padlock for the locker."

"Cheers."

Oliver took the keycard. He climbed the staircase. The staircase was narrow. The walls were covered in stickers. The stickers were the same stickers, minus the handful that had peeled off and plus the handful that new guests had added in the six weeks since the hostel had reopened. A new sticker: a rainbow-coloured oval that said KHAOSAN ROAD SURVIVOR. Another: a small square with a QR code that, if scanned, led to the Instagram account of a Swedish backpacker who was attempting to visit every country in the world and was currently at number forty-seven and whose account had six thousand followers and whose life was, like Connor's life had been, curated for an audience that was smaller than the curation effort warranted.

The third step squeaked.

Oliver noticed the squeak. He noticed it the way every guest noticed it -- a brief sensory registration, a filing of the information under "hostel character," a forgetting that began immediately and would be complete by the third ascent. The squeak was the building's voice and the voice said the same thing it always said, which was *I am here, I am old, I have been climbed by thousands of feet and I will be climbed by thousands more and the climbing is my purpose and my wear.*

Second floor. Corridor. Dorm 3.

The room was the room. Eight bunks, ceiling fan, air well. Five beds claimed by the evidence of absent people: backpacks, clothing, a novel, a phone charger. Bed 7 was empty, the mattress bare except for the folded sheet and towel.

Oliver sat on the mattress. He heard voices from the air well -- laughter, ease -- and smelled cooking from the ground floor. Mama Siti's kitchen, the eternal kitchen.

He lay back and closed his eyes. The flight from Bangkok had been early. He was tired. He slept.

The ceiling fan turned above him. And in the bed frame beneath his sleeping body, the letters were still there. LENA. Four letters scratched into dark wood. And below LENA, the other names -- TOM, JULIE, HANS -- the names of people who had slept here and left and survived and forgotten.

Connor's name was not there. But the bed that Connor had slept in was the bed that Oliver was sleeping in, and the continuity was the continuity of the system -- the system that produced young travellers and cheap hostels and the intersection of the two, and the occasional, inevitable interruption of the flow by violence or the law.

---

Oliver came downstairs at seven in the evening.

The common room was occupied. Three guests on the vinyl couch, watching CNN on the wall-mounted television -- the news cycle that was, as always, a rotation of crises and recoveries and the perpetual middle-distance of geopolitics that was the soundtrack of hostel common rooms worldwide. Two guests at the communal table, laptops open, the blue glow of screens reflecting off their faces, the digital nomads or the pretenders to digital nomadism, the people who sat in hostels with laptops and called it work and called themselves location-independent and were, in their way, performing the same ritual that Connor had performed at the same table six weeks ago.

Mama Siti was in the kitchen. The kitchen was warm. The kitchen smelled of onion and garlic and the particular, complex fragrance of sambal being cooked -- the chilli paste that was the base of half of Malay cuisine, the paste that Mama Siti made fresh every morning and that was, by evening, reduced to the remnants that clung to the pot and perfumed the air.

Oliver entered the common room and stood for a moment in the doorway, performing the social assessment that every solo traveller performed when entering a communal space: who is here, who looks approachable, who is too absorbed to disturb, where is the entry point to conversation. The assessment was unconscious, practised, the survival skill of a person who had been travelling alone for six months and had learned that the difference between loneliness and companionship was the willingness to walk into a room of strangers and say something.

He said something. "Anyone know where's good to eat around here?"

The question was the universal hostel opener -- the question that was not really about food but about connection, the question that said *I am here, I am new, I am available for the temporary friendship that this building facilitates.* The question was answered by one of the laptop users -- a Dutch woman, twenties, who recommended a hawker stall on Jalan Alor without looking up from her screen, the recommendation delivered with the practised efficiency of a person who had answered the same question from the same type of person in the same type of building in the same type of city dozens of times.

Oliver nodded. He started toward the door.

"Actually, mate, I was just heading out. I know a brilliant spot if you want company."

The voice came from behind him. Oliver turned.

The man was sitting in a chair by the window, a chair that Oliver had not registered because the man had been still, the stillness of a person who had been waiting, although waiting was not the word -- the word was *watching*, the passive, patient observation of the common room's traffic, the watching of a person who was looking for something and had just found it.

The man was Malaysian. Young -- late twenties, maybe early thirties. He was handsome in the way that charming people were handsome, which was to say that the handsomeness was not purely physical but was a combination of features and expression and the animation of the face that came from an intelligence that manifested as social ease. He wore a clean collared shirt, rolled at the sleeves, and dark jeans and leather shoes that were slightly too nice for a hostel common room. He had a beer in his hand -- a Tiger beer, the green bottle sweating condensation in the humid air.

He was not Felix. Felix was in Cambodia. Felix was operating out of a hostel in Phnom Penh, a city with cheaper rents and looser enforcement and the restless, accelerating energy of a Southeast Asian city that was experiencing the kind of growth that attracted both investment and exploitation, the growth that created opportunities for the legitimate and the illegitimate alike. Felix was in Cambodia and Felix was not coming back and Felix's warrant was circulating through the databases and the warrant would find him or it would not and the finding or the not-finding was the system's business, the slow, procedural pursuit that was the legal system's version of a chase, the chase measured not in kilometres but in documents.

This man was not Felix. This man was someone else. This man was the system's next iteration, the pattern's next expression, the proof that the pattern was not dependent on Felix, was not the product of a single charming German but was the product of conditions -- the conditions of a hostel in a city in a country where drugs moved through bodies and the bodies were recruited from the common rooms of buildings like this one by people like this one, the people who were charming and local and knew the city and knew the opportunities and knew the targets.

"I'm Riz," the man said. He extended his hand. The handshake was firm, warm, the handshake of a person who had been trained in the social protocols that made strangers comfortable, the handshake that was the first gesture of a relationship that would develop according to a pattern that was not Riz's invention but the pattern's invention, the pattern reproducing itself through a new operator the way a franchise reproduced itself through new locations, the product the same, the branding different, the system identical.

"Oliver," Oliver said.

"British?"

"Yeah. London. Well, Croydon. South London."

Riz smiled. The smile was the smile of a person who found the other person's answer charming, who found the distinction between Croydon and South London amusing and endearing, who found Oliver -- broke, alone, between things, newly arrived -- to be exactly the kind of person who was worth smiling at, worth buying a beer for, worth investing an evening in.

"First time in KL?"

"Yeah. Just got in from Bangkok."

"Bangkok." Riz nodded, the nod of a person who understood Bangkok and its particular intensity, the nod of a person who had context for Oliver's arrival and could place it in the narrative of a young traveller moving through Southeast Asia. "Bangkok's intense. KL's different. KL's... easier. More relaxed. You'll like it."

"I hope so."

"Come on, I'll take you to a hawker centre. The real one, not the tourist one. My treat."

The offer was the offer. The offer was a beer and a meal and the company of a local who knew the city and who was generous and charming and who had appeared at exactly the moment when Oliver needed exactly what this man was offering -- connection, guidance, the antidote to the loneliness that had followed him from Croydon to Bangkok to KL.

Oliver hesitated. The hesitation was brief -- approximately two seconds, the duration of a thought that did not fully form, the thought that was less a thought than an instinct, the instinct that something about this situation was familiar in a way that Oliver could not place because Oliver had not been in this situation before but the situation had existed before, the situation was a pattern, and patterns generated a frequency that some people could detect and some people could not, and Oliver was in the category of people who could detect the frequency but could not interpret it, who felt the vibration without identifying the source.

The hesitation passed. The two seconds elapsed. The thought -- or the instinct, or the vibration -- dissolved, the way all such subtle warnings dissolved when they were not reinforced by knowledge, by context, by the specific information that would have converted the instinct into a decision. The information that would have converted the instinct into a decision was: a man named Connor Briggs sat in this common room six weeks ago and a man named Felix Decker made the same offer and the offer led to envelopes and the envelopes led to packages and the packages led to a suitcase and the suitcase led to a checkpoint and the checkpoint led to a cell and the cell led to a towel and the towel led to death. This information existed. This information was in police files and newspaper archives and Tomoko's Instagram and the memories of Priya and Jake and Mei Ling and Mama Siti and Ahmad. This information was everywhere except in Oliver's head, and the absence of the information in Oliver's head was the absence that made the pattern possible, the gap in knowledge that was the gap through which the pattern moved, the ignorance that was not stupidity but was the human condition of not knowing what you did not know.

"Yeah, alright," Oliver said. "Sounds good."

Riz bought Oliver a beer from the cooler behind reception. Tiger, the same green bottle, RM8. Mei Ling processed the sale. Mei Ling looked at Riz. Mei Ling looked at Oliver. Mei Ling looked at the beer.

Mei Ling's expression did not change. The professional composure held.

But behind it, Mei Ling felt the recognition. Not the man. The sequence. New guest. Charming local. Beer. The offer. She had watched this sequence before. She knew how it ended.

Mei Ling handed the beer to Oliver. "Enjoy," she said.

The word was the word of a receptionist. The word was also a prayer. The word was the hope that Oliver would enjoy his beer and his evening and his stay at the Lantern Hostel and would leave alive and would never know how close he was, in this moment, to the beginning of a sequence that had killed the man who had slept in his bed six weeks ago.

Oliver and Riz left through the front door. The bell rang. The door closed. The common room resumed its evening rhythm -- the CNN broadcast, the laptop screens, the slow accumulation of guests returning from the day and gathering in the shared space that was the hostel's social heart.

---

Mama Siti saw.

She was in the kitchen. She was always in the kitchen. She observed through the window between kitchen and common room -- the frame through which the hostel's daily drama played, the cast rotating but the plot unchanged.

She saw Oliver. She saw the beer. She saw Riz. She saw the offer. She saw the acceptance. She saw the departure.

Her face did not change. Guests described it as "inscrutable," which was the word tourists used for a face they could not read. The face was not inscrutable. The face was the face of a woman watching the first scene of a story she had seen before.

She turned from the window. She went to the rice cooker. The rice cooker was plugged in. The rice was soaking -- the basmati that she used for nasi lemak, the rice washed three times and soaked for two hours in coconut milk and pandan leaf, the preparation that was the ritual's beginning, the first step in the process that would produce, by 6 AM the next morning, the nasi lemak that would be placed on the counter in the kitchen.

She checked the sambal. The sambal was in the pot on the stove, reduced and resting, the chilli paste that was the heart of the dish, the paste that had been cooked since early morning and was now at the stage of its preparation where it needed only to cool and be stored and be reheated tomorrow. The sambal was ready. The anchovies were fried. The peanuts were roasted. The eggs were boiled.

The nasi lemak would be ready in the morning. The plate would be set at the counter. The banana leaf would be laid out. The rice would be mounded. The sambal would be spooned. The anchovies would be scattered. The peanuts would be placed. The egg would be halved and positioned, the yolk bright against the white, the white bright against the green of the banana leaf.

The plate would be there. The plate would be the question. The question was the question that Mama Siti asked every morning, the question that was not spoken but was contained in the plate, in the food, in the act of preparation, the question that was:

*If you come to eat, I will know you are still alive.*

The question would be asked of Oliver, as it had been asked of Connor, as it had been asked of every guest who had slept in the hostel during the seventeen years that Mama Siti had cooked in its kitchen. The question was not a magic spell. The question was not a protection. The question was a woman's way of counting the living, of taking attendance, of performing the daily census that was the cook's privilege and the cook's burden -- the burden of knowing that the absence of a person at breakfast was the absence that might mean departure or might mean death, and the difference between the two was the difference between a guest who had checked out and a guest who had been checked out, and the checking out was sometimes voluntary and sometimes was not.

Mama Siti covered the sambal pot. She wiped the counter. She removed her apron and folded it and placed it on the hook by the door. She turned off the kitchen light.

She walked through the common room. The guests did not notice her. The cook was part of the building's infrastructure, invisible in the way that all service workers were invisible to the people they served.

She walked to the front door. She paused. She looked back at the common room. The room was warm. The red lanterns glowed. The ceiling fans turned. The guests sat and talked and typed and lived.

Somewhere in the city, a young British man was eating hawker food with a charming local man who had bought him a beer and who was asking about his plans and who was saying, perhaps at this very moment, the words that were the words: *I might know a way to make some easy money.*

The words would be spoken. Or the words would not be spoken -- not tonight, maybe, but tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after. The words would be spoken because the words were the pattern's dialogue, the script that the system produced, and the system did not require Felix to produce the script. The system required only the conditions -- the lonely foreigner, the financial pressure, the charming stranger, the offer -- and the conditions were met, and the conditions were always met, and the meeting of the conditions was the pattern's activation, the system's ignition, the beginning of the sequence that began with a beer and ended, sometimes, with a cell.

Mama Siti did not know if the sequence would complete. She did not know if Oliver would accept the offer, if Oliver would carry the envelope, if Oliver would escalate from envelope to package to backpack to suitcase. She did not know because the future was the future and the future was unknowable and the knowing of the future was not her function. Her function was the kitchen. Her function was the nasi lemak. Her function was the plate on the counter and the question in the plate and the counting of the living.

She stepped into the street. Petaling Street was busy with the evening crowd -- the tourists and the locals and the hawkers and the traffic, the sensory tumult of a city that did not slow down at night but merely changed its register, the daytime commerce replaced by the nighttime commerce, the market stalls replaced by the food stalls, the shoppers replaced by the diners.

She walked toward the LRT station. Her steps were slow. Her steps were the steps of a woman who had been walking this street for longer than the hostel had existed, who had been present in this neighbourhood since before the building was a hostel, since before it was an abandoned ruin, since before it was a brothel and a gambling den and a Japanese administrative office. Her steps were the steps of continuity, the human thread that connected the building's iterations, the woman who had cooked in the kitchen under every version of the building's identity and who would cook in the kitchen under the next version, whatever the next version was.

The nasi lemak would be ready in the morning.

The plate would be set at the counter.

The question would be asked.

And the answer -- the answer that was not words but was the act of arriving, the act of sitting, the act of eating, the act of being present at breakfast in a body that was alive and hungry and capable of the simple, essential, irreducible act of consuming food -- the answer would be given or it would not, and the giving or the not-giving would tell Mama Siti what she needed to know, which was the only thing she had ever needed to know, which was: *are you still here? Are you still alive? Did you survive the night?*

The night would tell.

The night always told.

---

In the common room, the television showed the news. The news was not about Connor Briggs. The news was about a trade deal and a typhoon and a football match and the rotation of events that was the news cycle's content, the cycle that had absorbed Connor's story and processed it and expelled it and moved on to the next story and the next, the cycle that was the mechanism by which the world converted events into history and history into the past and the past into the material from which the future was built.

The common room was warm. The lanterns glowed. The ceiling fans turned.

Upstairs, in Dorm 3, Bed 7 was empty. The mattress held the impression of Oliver's body -- the slight depression, the warmth that was fading, the evidence of recent occupation that would be gone by morning. The bed waited. The bed was patient. The bed had the patience of a thing that had no consciousness and therefore no impatience, a thing that existed in the permanent present tense of objects, the tense in which there was no waiting because there was no expectation of what came next.

The ceiling fan turned above the bed.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

The sound was the building's heartbeat. The sound was the metronome of the system. The sound measured nothing and the sound measured everything -- the interval between arrivals, the interval between departures, the interval between the filling and the emptying of a bed that had been filled and emptied hundreds of times and would be filled and emptied hundreds of times more.

The pattern was not Felix. The pattern was the system. The system was not the network. The system was the world. The world was the world, and the world produced the conditions, and the conditions produced the pattern, and the pattern produced the deaths, and the deaths were absorbed by the building and the building continued and the pattern continued and the world continued.

The ceiling fan turned.

The lanterns glowed.

The night fell on Kuala Lumpur the way night fell on all cities -- without discrimination, without mercy, without awareness of what the darkness concealed, which was everything: the charming strangers and the lonely travellers and the hawker stalls and the police stations and the cells and the towels and the law that applied to everyone and the law that spared no one and the law that was the law and the law did not care and the law did not forgive and the law was waiting, the law was always waiting, for the next one.

*End of Chapter 48*
