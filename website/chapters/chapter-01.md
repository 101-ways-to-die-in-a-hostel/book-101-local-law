# Chapter 1: Arrival

The plane touched down at KLIA2 with the kind of graceless thud that only budget airlines could deliver, a gut-punch of rubber on tarmac that rattled the overhead bins and jolted awake every backpacker who'd passed out during the three-hour haul from Denpasar. Connor Briggs didn't flinch. He'd flown AirAsia enough times to know that the landing was less an arrival and more a controlled argument with the ground. Besides, he was busy. His phone was angled at the window, filming the blur of tropical green and grey runway sliding past, the afternoon light thick and golden, the kind of light that Instagram was built for.

"KL, baby," he murmured, already composing the caption. *New country, new chapter. No plans. No limits. Just vibes.* He'd workshop the hashtags later. He had a system: location tag first, then the aspirational ones -- #digitalnomad, #livingmybestlife, #noplannoworries -- and finally the bait for the algorithm, #malaysia #kualalumpur #backpackerlife. He knew what he was doing. Four years on the road, twelve countries, forty-two hundred followers. Well, forty-one-eighty-something, but you round up. Everyone rounds up.

The seatbelt sign dinged off and the cabin erupted into the usual Pavlovian scramble of people reaching for bags they'd spent three hours pressed against. Connor stayed seated. He'd learned this move in Bangkok, years ago: let the amateurs clog the aisle while you sit back, relaxed, visibly unbothered. It was a small performance, but performance was the point. He stretched his arms above his head, letting the hem of his singlet ride up over the flat, sun-browned plane of his stomach, and yawned like a man who had nowhere to be. Because he didn't. That was the whole thing. That was the life.

The woman in the middle seat -- Chinese, maybe, or Malaysian, Connor wasn't great with distinctions -- squeezed past him with an apologetic nod. He flashed her his best grin, the one that crinkled the corners of his eyes and made him look like a guy in a toothpaste ad, if the toothpaste ad took place in a Bali surf shack.

"No worries," he said, even though she hadn't said anything.

He waited until the aisle was nearly clear, then stood, pulled his battered Osprey pack from the overhead bin with practiced ease, and joined the slow shuffle toward the exit. The air shifted as he neared the door -- the seal of the cabin breaking, the first breath of outside pushing in. It was warm. Not Bali-warm, which was a dry, volcanic warmth that sat on your skin like powder. This was different. This was *wet*. The humidity hit him in the jetway like walking into someone's open mouth, a living heat that was part water, part engine exhaust, part something botanical and unnameable. His skin went slick in the time it took to walk thirty meters.

*Welcome to Malaysia*, he thought. *This'll do.*

Connor had no plan for Kuala Lumpur. This was by design. Plans were for amateurs -- for the gap-year kids with their colour-coded itineraries and their Lonely Planet guides bristling with Post-it flags, for the couples who booked everything three months in advance and then spent the whole trip anxious that reality wouldn't match the TripAdvisor photos. Connor didn't do that. Connor *flowed*. He arrived somewhere, found the cheapest hostel with decent reviews, and let the city tell him what to do. This approach had served him well across twelve countries and four years of what he called, with no irony whatsoever, *living deliberately*. It had also, on three separate occasions, left him sleeping in a bus station, but those were stories now. Content. The bus station in Vientiane was one of his most-liked posts.

The terminal at KLIA2 was a cathedral of budget travel -- high ceilings, wide corridors, the antiseptic gleam of a building designed to move millions of people who'd each paid forty dollars for the privilege. Connor moved through it with the loose-hipped confidence of a man who'd done this many times, which he had. He knew airports the way some people knew their local supermarket: the rhythms, the shortcuts, the unspoken rules. Find the signs for immigration. Join the shortest queue. Passport out, landing card ready, pen behind the ear. Smile at the officer. Don't joke. They never think you're funny.

He was filling out his landing card when the pen ran out, the cheap blue ink fading to nothing halfway through *Purpose of Visit*. He'd written *TOUR* in careful block capitals. He looked around for another pen, patting his shorts pockets with one hand. A Malay family in the queue behind him -- mother, father, two kids in school uniforms -- noticed his predicament. The father offered his pen without a word. Connor took it with a grin.

"Legend. Cheers, mate."

The father smiled politely. The mother pulled her children slightly closer. Connor didn't notice.

He breezed through immigration. The officer, a woman in a hijab with an expression of practised neutrality, stamped his passport without looking up. Ninety-day visa on arrival. The stamp was a little crooked. Connor photographed it for his stories, the navy blue of the Australian passport played artfully against his tanned hand and the faded compass tattoo on his inner forearm. He'd gotten the tattoo in Ubud -- a compass with no cardinal points, because, as he'd explained to approximately two hundred people, "I don't need directions, I just need momentum." It had cost him the equivalent of twelve dollars and three Bintang beers, and it was, he believed, the single most authentic thing about him.

He was still looking at his phone when he walked through the arrivals hall.

The sign was impossible to miss, which is why it was remarkable that Connor missed it. It hung above the corridor at eye level, backlit, in English and Bahasa Melayu, in letters the size of a man's hand. White text on red. The universal colour of warning, of stop, of *pay attention*:

**WARNING**
**DEATH FOR DRUG TRAFFICKERS UNDER MALAYSIAN LAW**

Beneath it, in smaller text: *The Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 prescribes the MANDATORY DEATH PENALTY for trafficking in dangerous drugs. This includes possession above threshold amounts of heroin (15g), methamphetamine (50g), cannabis (200g), and other controlled substances.*

There was a graphic, too -- a stylised noose, rendered in the kind of stark, government-issue design that left nothing to interpretation. The sign was in four languages. It was flanked by Malaysian flags. It was, by any reasonable measure, the least subtle thing in an airport full of duty-free perfume advertisements and currency exchange signs.

Connor walked past it. His eyes were on his phone, his thumb scrolling through the notifications that had loaded now that he was connected to the terminal Wi-Fi. Seven Instagram likes. A comment from his mother: *Beautiful sunset! Stay safe darling xx*. A DM from a girl he'd met in Canggu asking if he was still in Bali. A WhatsApp message from Jake -- some American he'd been chatting with on a hostel forum -- saying *bro im at a sick hostel in KL petaling street area come thru*.

He thumbed a reply to Jake: *just landed bruh. On my way. Where u at?*

He did not look up. The sign hung above him for three full seconds, close enough that he could have reached up and touched the perspex casing, close enough that the red glow of the backlight fell briefly across the screen of his phone, colouring his mother's message the shade of arterial blood.

Then he was past it, and the sign was behind him, and it did not follow.

---

The KLIA Ekspres was the best thirty-five ringgit Connor didn't want to spend. He knew there were cheaper options -- a bus, probably, or one of those shared vans he'd seen in other Asian airports -- but his phone was at twelve percent and he needed to get to the city while he still had GPS. He didn't carry a power bank. He'd owned one, briefly, in Vietnam, but it had been heavy and he'd left it at a guesthouse in Hoi An and never replaced it. His position on power banks, which he'd articulated to several people who hadn't asked, was that they were a crutch. "If your phone dies, you just talk to people. That's how you *actually* travel."

This philosophy had a few cracks in practice, such as the time his phone died in rural Cambodia and he'd walked for two hours in the wrong direction on a road with no signage, but that was also a story now. Content.

The train was fast, clean, and air-conditioned to the point of violence. After the swamp-heat of the terminal, the carriage hit Connor like a refrigerator. He dropped into a window seat, pressed his forehead against the glass, and watched Malaysia unscroll.

The view from the Ekspres was a time-lapse of a country assembling itself. First: palm oil plantations, the trees in military rows, their fronds like green explosions frozen in mid-detonation. Then: industrial sprawl, warehouses with corrugated roofs, the skeletons of construction projects rising from red earth. Then, gradually, then all at once: the city. Kuala Lumpur emerged from the haze like a hallucination -- towers of glass and steel erupting from a canopy of tropical green, the skyline a jagged fever chart of ambition. And there, dead centre, unmistakable, ridiculous, magnificent: the Petronas Twin Towers, their tapered silver forms catching the late afternoon light and throwing it back in sheets of white fire.

Connor pressed record. His phone was at nine percent.

"Fully sick," he said to no one, panning across the skyline. The Petronas Towers filled the frame, then a golden mosque dome slid into view, then a cluster of palm trees, then a highway overpass, then a billboard for Milo in Bahasa Melayu. He held the shot until the towers disappeared behind a wall of apartment blocks, and then he stopped recording and checked the battery. Seven percent.

*She'll be right*, he thought. *Just need to get to the hostel and plug in.*

KL Sentral was a hive. Connor emerged from the Ekspres platform into a multi-level transit hub that thrummed -- escalators flowing in both directions, digital boards flickering with Malay text, the hum of a million commuters compressed into architecture, the smell of fried chicken from a KFC that seemed to exist in a pocket dimension between the LRT platforms. People moved with purpose. Connor moved with the carefully calibrated purposelessness of a man who wanted you to know he was in no rush.

He found the LRT almost by instinct. Years of navigating foreign transit systems had given him a sixth sense for the architecture of trains -- follow the signs, follow the flow of people with bags, and if all else fails, look lost near a security guard until they point you in the right direction. The LRT to Pasar Seni was two stops. He stood in the carriage, one hand on the overhead rail, his Osprey between his feet, and watched the city slide past the windows at a different speed now, closer, the buildings no longer a skyline but a street-level blur of signage and movement and life.

Pasar Seni station spat him out onto a covered walkway that led, in short order, to the edge of Petaling Street. And there, the city stopped being a postcard and became a body.

The heat was the first thing. Not the gentle warmth of the air-conditioned train or the filtered chill of the airport, but the full, unmediated assault of equatorial afternoon -- thirty-two degrees and eighty-something percent humidity, the air so thick with moisture that breathing felt like drinking. Connor's singlet adhered to his chest in the time it took to walk twenty steps. Sweat tracked down the channel of his spine. His flip-flops -- Havaianas, the only footwear he'd owned for two years -- slapped against wet pavement.

The second thing was the noise. Not noise, exactly -- noise suggested chaos. This was more like an orchestra tuning up, every instrument playing a different song. Cantonese shouted from a market stall to his left, a vendor holding up a fake Louis Vuitton bag and quoting a price in three currencies. Mandarin from somewhere behind him, rapid-fire, the tonal shifts like music. The sizzle and clatter of a wok from a hawker cart to his right, where a man in a stained apron was tossing flat noodles in a blackened pan, flames licking up around the edges. The roar of a motorbike splitting the pedestrian traffic. The tinny echo of Cantopop from a speaker balanced on a stack of shoeboxes. The distant, almost subliminal rumble of thunder, somewhere over the hills to the east, promising the afternoon storm that came every day like clockwork.

And the smell. Connor had been to markets in Bali and Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, and he'd thought he understood what a Southeast Asian street market smelled like. He was wrong, or at least incomplete. Petaling Street had its own olfactory signature, layered and complex: the char-sweet smoke of char kway teow frying, the waxy tang of incense drifting from a temple doorway, the diesel bite of a passing lorry, the vegetal funk of morning glory piled on a cart, and beneath it all, rising from the storm drains in the heat, a sulfurous note that wasn't exactly unpleasant but wasn't exactly pleasant either, the smell of a tropical city sweating through its infrastructure.

Connor raised his phone. Four percent. He filmed anyway. A slow pan across the market -- the canopy of blue and red tarpaulins stretched over the stalls, the riotous colour of fake designer goods hanging from every surface, the signs in Chinese and Malay and English all shouting at once, the faces of the crowd -- local and tourist, young and old, all moving through the narrow corridor of the market with the particular shuffle of people who are simultaneously going somewhere and going nowhere.

He narrated as he walked, his voice low and conspiratorial, the voice he used for his stories: "Day one in KL. No plan. No agenda. Just dropped into Chinatown and, like -- look at this. Look at this place. You can't plan this. You just have to let it happen." He turned the camera on himself, grinning, the market a kaleidoscopic blur behind him. "This is what travel is, guys. This right here. Hashtag no filter, hashtag no plan."

His phone died mid-selfie, the screen going black with the abruptness of a power cut. Connor stared at it for a moment, then laughed.

"Classic."

He needed directions. He had the hostel name -- The Lantern -- and a vague sense that it was somewhere on or near Petaling Street, which was where he was, which meant it couldn't be far. The backpacker logic was sound: hostels in Chinatown clustered together like barnacles on a hull. He just needed a vector.

He approached the nearest vendor, a middle-aged Chinese man surrounded by a fortress of phone cases and charger cables. The man was reading a newspaper folded into quarters, his reading glasses perched on the end of his nose.

"Hey, mate," Connor said. He did the thing he always did in countries where English wasn't the first language: he spoke louder and slower, as if volume and tempo were the same as translation. "Do. You. Know. The Lantern. Hostel? The. Lantern?"

The man looked up from his paper. He regarded Connor with an expression that contained, in its various layers, patience, amusement, and something that might have been pity.

"The Lantern?" the man said, in English that was not only perfect but faintly accented with the clipped precision of someone who'd studied in an English-medium school. "Yes. Go to the end of this row, turn left at the temple, walk fifty meters. It's between the phone repair shop and the Chinese medicine store. You'll see the red lanterns."

Connor blinked. "Oh. Cheers. Legend."

"You're welcome," the man said, and returned to his newspaper.

Connor walked. The vendor's directions were exact. At the end of the market row, a Chinese temple appeared on the corner -- red and gold, dragons on the roof, the sweet fog of joss sticks rolling from the open door. Connor turned left. The street narrowed. The market stalls thinned and gave way to shophouses -- old, beautiful, slightly decrepit, their facades decorated with plaster mouldings that might have been ornate once but were now softened by decades of humidity and neglect. The colours were pastels gone dark: mint green, faded coral, a yellow that had surrendered to ochre.

Fifty meters. And there it was.

---

The Lantern Hostel announced itself in the way that the best hostels always did -- not with a sign (though there was a sign, small and hand-painted, hanging from a bracket above the door) but with a feeling. A narrow entrance, squeezed between a phone repair shop on the left and a traditional Chinese medicine store on the right. The phone repair shop had a cluttered window display of cracked screens and coiled cables and a fluorescent light that buzzed with the resigned hum of a machine that had been on too long. The medicine store's window was darker, lined with jars of dried things -- roots, bark, something that might have been seahorses -- and a faded poster of an anatomical diagram with meridian lines drawn in red. Between these two businesses, a door. Not even a wide door -- Connor had to turn slightly sideways with his pack on. But above the door, and in the narrow hallway beyond it, and strung along the ceiling like a procession of small, soft fires: red paper lanterns.

They were beautiful. Connor would grant the place that before he'd even seen the reception desk. The lanterns hung at irregular intervals, their glow warm and amber, turning the narrow corridor into something that felt less like a hallway and more like a throat, leading down into the belly of an old building that had been breathing for nearly a century. The floor was tile -- patterned, cracked, original -- and the walls were close enough to touch on both sides. The air was different in here: cooler, tinged with the smell of damp wood and something herbal and sharp that Connor couldn't identify but which was, in fact, Tiger Balm.

He emerged from the corridor into a small reception area. A wooden counter, scarred and ancient, with a brass bell on it and a rack of pamphlets behind it -- tour operators, restaurant recommendations, a laminated sheet of LRT maps. A bookshelf against one wall, stuffed with the paperback detritus of a thousand travelers: dog-eared thrillers, Lonely Planet guides three editions out of date, a German-English dictionary, a copy of *Shantaram* so swollen with humidity it looked like it was trying to become a different book. A ceiling fan turned overhead with the languid dedication of something that had been turning for decades and would continue turning long after everyone in the room was dead.

Behind the counter, a young woman was looking at him with an expression that suggested she'd seen his exact type walk through this door approximately once a week for two years and had long since stopped being charmed.

"Hi," Connor said, deploying the grin. "I'm after a bed? Dorm, cheapest you've got."

Mei Ling Chen was twenty-four, Malaysian-Chinese, and constructed almost entirely of sharp angles -- cheekbones, elbows, the precise line of her ponytail, the geometric efficiency of her movements behind the counter. She wore a polo shirt with a small red lantern embroidered on the breast pocket, and she moved with the practiced economy of someone who had checked in enough backpackers to have reduced the entire process to its essential elements: look, assess, process, assign, forget.

"Passport," she said.

Connor handed it over. She opened it, glanced at the photo -- younger, cleaner, the ghost of a haircut -- and then at him, and then back at the photo, performing the comparison with the clinical detachment of a customs officer.

"Australian," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Melbourne." Connor leaned on the counter. "You been?"

"No." She placed the passport face-down on a small photocopier behind the counter, pressed a button, and returned it to him in a single fluid motion. "How many nights?"

"Two, to start. Maybe more. See how the vibes are."

"RM seventy for two nights. Cash preferred."

Connor peeled three fifty-ringgit notes from the thin fold of Malaysian currency he'd exchanged at the airport, and Mei Ling made change with the same economical precision. She placed a key on the counter -- not a key card, an actual key, brass, attached to a wooden fob with the number 3 burned into it.

"Dorm 3, second floor. Bed 7." She slid a laminated sheet across the counter. "House rules."

Connor glanced at the sheet the way he glanced at safety cards on airplanes: with the performative attention of someone who had already decided not to read it.

The rules were printed in four languages -- English, Malay, Mandarin, Japanese -- in a font size that suggested someone had tried to fit a lot of information into a small space. He caught fragments: *Quiet after 11 PM... No drugs on premises... Check-out by 11 AM...* Standard hostel fare. His eyes skated over the text with practised speed, catching nothing, retaining less.

At the bottom of the sheet, in a different colour -- red, the colour of the lanterns, the colour of the sign at the airport, the colour of all the things Connor did not read -- a final line:

*Guests are responsible for knowing and obeying Malaysian law. The hostel is not liable for the consequences of guests' actions.*

Connor picked up the pen on the counter and signed the guest book -- an actual ledger, paper, the pages thick with the accumulated signatures of hundreds of travelers. He signed with the loose, confident scrawl of someone who had signed many guest books in many countries and had never once read what he was signing. His name joined the column of others: a Japanese name, an unreadable European signature, the careful block letters of someone named PRIYA S.

"WiFi password?" he asked.

"On the whiteboard behind you. Changes every Monday."

"Legend."

Mei Ling watched him turn to look at the whiteboard, and in the brief moment when his back was turned, something crossed her face -- not quite concern, not quite recognition. More like the expression of a person who has watched the same movie enough times to know exactly when the jump scare is coming and has stopped flinching but hasn't stopped noticing.

"Enjoy your stay," she said, when he turned back. Her voice was neutral. Her eyes were not.

---

The staircase to the second floor was a relic. Narrow enough that Connor's shoulders nearly brushed both walls, the steps worn into shallow bowls by decades of feet, the wooden bannisters dark with the oil of a thousand hands. Travel stickers from hostels around the world covered the walls -- peeling, overlapping, a geological record of backpacker culture going back years. *Viraporn's Place, Chiang Mai. The Mad Monkey, Phnom Penh. Loki Hostel, La Paz.* Connor recognized some of them. He'd stayed at the Mad Monkey. That was the place with the pool and the happy hour that started at noon. He'd been twenty-three then. A lifetime ago. Three lifetimes.

Dorm 3 was at the end of a corridor lit by two more red lanterns and a single bare bulb. Connor pushed open the door -- no lock, just a handle -- and stepped inside.

Eight beds, arranged in four bunks of two, the frames made of dark wood that might have been beautiful once and was now merely solid. The room was deep and narrow, the architecture of the original shophouse asserting itself -- the building had been designed to be long rather than wide, and the dorm followed suit, stretching back into shadow. There were no windows on the side walls. The only natural light came from the far end, where an opening in the wall looked out onto the air well -- the central shaft of the building, open to the sky, a rectangle of grey afternoon light and the sound of rain beginning to fall somewhere above. The air well carried the smell of wet concrete and the faint, drifting sound of someone playing music on a phone two floors up.

Bed 7 was a bottom bunk, second from the back, against the right wall. Connor tossed his Osprey onto the thin mattress -- the universal hostel mattress, a slab of foam sheathed in vinyl that squeaked when you moved and smelled of disinfectant and the accumulated dreams of strangers. He sat on the edge and bounced, once.

"Not bad," he said, to the empty room.

He unpacked. This was a ritual, and like all of Connor's rituals, it was quick and devoid of ceremony. Four years of backpacking had reduced his possessions to the essentials, or what he considered essentials: three pairs of board shorts (two identical, one with a bleach stain that he'd decided was "character"), four singlets of varying degrees of fading, underwear that he would not submit to close inspection, his Havaianas and a single pair of running shoes he hadn't run in for seven months, a phone charger with a fraying cable, a half-empty bottle of sunscreen, and his toiletries bag -- a Ziploc that contained a toothbrush, toothpaste, a razor he hadn't used in a week, and a stick of deodorant that was optimistic at best.

And the towel.

He pulled it from the bottom of his pack with something approaching reverence. His blue Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel. It was, and Connor would tell you this without prompting, the single best purchase he had ever made. Four years old. Been to every country he'd been to. Dried him on beaches in Bali, in rivers in Laos, in showers in thirty different hostels across Southeast Asia. It was compact -- rolled down to the size of a beer can -- and it was absurdly absorbent, and it dried in an hour, and it was the exact shade of blue as the ocean at Nusa Penida on a clear day. He'd photographed it in twelve countries. It had its own hashtag: #towelofadventure. Eleven posts. Forty-seven total likes.

He draped the towel over the end of the bunk frame, where it hung like a small blue flag.

The last item from his pack was a book: a battered, water-damaged copy of *The Beach* by Alex Garland. He'd bought it at a secondhand bookshop in Bangkok three years ago because it seemed like the kind of book a traveler should have, and he'd been carrying it ever since, reading it in sporadic bursts that never lasted more than ten pages before his phone offered something more immediately stimulating. He was on page eighty-six. He'd been on page eighty-six for four months. He set it on the narrow shelf above his pillow, next to a pair of earplugs left by a previous guest.

Connor lay back on the bunk and stared at the slats above him. The wood was old, scarred, and covered in the graffiti of travelers past -- initials, dates, tiny drawings, the usual declarations of love and obscenity that people leave in places they'll never return to. Someone had drawn a surprisingly detailed penis. Someone else had written *BERLIN FOREVER* in Sharpie. Another hand had carved, with a key or a knife, the words *IF YOU'RE READING THIS, GO HOME*.

Connor smiled. He wouldn't be reading any of it. He was already reaching for his phone before he remembered it was dead. He plugged it in -- the socket was behind the bed frame, requiring a contortion that pressed his face against the mattress of the bunk above -- and lay back.

His right hand rested on the bed frame. His fingers, idly tracing the wood grain, passed over something that wasn't grain. Letters, carved shallow into the dark wood, small and careful, as if the person carving them had been trying to be quiet:

**LENA**

Connor's fingers moved across the name without recognition, without pause, the way a hand moves across a surface in the dark -- registering texture but not meaning. He was already thinking about the WiFi password, about the Instagram post he'd make when his phone came back to life, about whether the hostel had a rooftop. His fingers left Lena's name and found his own knee, which he scratched absently.

If he had looked, he would have seen the name. If he had asked, someone might have told him about the Swedish girl who'd slept in this bed a year ago, who'd been friendly and blonde and trusting, who'd also met a charming European man in the common room, who was now in Kajang Prison, four hundred and seven days into an indefinite wait for a trial that would almost certainly end with a judge pronouncing the words *gantung sampai mati* -- hanged until dead.

But Connor did not look, and did not ask, and instead lay in the dark of Dorm 3 and listened to the rain falling into the air well and thought about absolutely nothing, which was his preferred state and his greatest vulnerability.

---

The common room at dusk was a living thing.

Connor came downstairs at half six, his phone resurrected to nineteen percent, his hair freshly wet from a shower that had oscillated between lukewarm and ambitious-but-cold, wearing clean board shorts and a singlet that read *BINTANG BEER* across the chest in the font of the famous Bali brewery. He'd considered the singlet that said *I SURVIVED THE FULL MOON PARTY* but decided it was trying too hard. The Bintang shirt struck the right balance: casual, travelled, alcoholic without being aggressive about it.

The common room occupied the ground floor's front section, between the reception desk and the kitchen. It was a space that had been furnished, over the years, through what appeared to be a combination of donations, salvage operations, and the gradual accumulation of things that nobody had thrown away. A sofa in brown corduroy, sagging in the middle like a horse that had given up. Two armchairs of different eras and upholstery. A low table covered in ring stains and a half-completed jigsaw puzzle that depicted the Petronas Towers and was missing, Connor would later count, at least thirty pieces. A bookshelf. A wall-mounted TV playing CNN with the volume low, a correspondent standing in front of something on fire somewhere. The ceiling fan. Always the ceiling fan, turning with its slow, eternal patience.

A few travelers were scattered through the room in the poses of early evening -- that liminal hour between the day's exertions and the night's decisions, when backpackers are at their most contemplative, their most sociable, their most vulnerable to suggestion.

A couple on the sofa, European, speaking French, sharing a bag of crisps. A guy with a guitar -- the three-stringed one that lived on the bookshelf -- plucking something that was either very avant-garde or very bad. A woman at the communal computer, an ancient Dell that hummed like a beehive, scrolling with the frustrated intensity of someone trying to load a webpage on a connection that had given up trying.

Through the air well, visible through the arched opening at the back of the room, the last of the daylight was draining from the sky. The rain had stopped, but the air well was still dripping, the sound of water on tile a slow, irregular percussion. Beyond the hostel's walls, the city was performing its evening transformation: the call to prayer from Masjid Jamek, distant but clear, a human voice rising above the traffic noise with the practiced beauty of a ritual performed five times a day; the growl of motorbikes; the first stirrings of the night market; a vendor somewhere calling out prices in a singsong Cantonese that carried over the rooftops and through the air well and into the common room like a voice from another world.

Connor breathed it in. The familiar alchemy was working. The chemical hit of a new place -- novelty cut with comfort, the hostel trick, the sense that you were somewhere foreign but also somewhere safe, that the world was enormous and strange and you had found a small pocket of it that was, for tonight at least, yours. His shoulders dropped. His jaw unclenched. The low-grade anxiety that he carried always -- about money, about the future, about the creeping suspicion that his life was a performance for an audience that didn't exist -- softened to a background hum.

*This is the life*, he thought. Not ironically. Not for content. Just the genuine, uncomplicated thought of a young man in a foreign city at the beginning of something, who did not know yet that the something had a shape, and the shape was a trap, and the trap had been baited long before he landed.

He walked to the small cooler behind the reception desk -- Mei Ling was gone, replaced by a laminated sign that read *BEER RM8, PAY TOMORROW, WE KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP* -- and pulled out a can of Tiger. The beer was cold and good. He popped it and took a long pull and stood there for a moment, surveying the common room with the proprietary satisfaction of a man who has just claimed his territory.

That was when someone said his name.

Not his name, exactly. His nationality, which for a certain type of Australian male abroad amounts to the same thing.

"Hey, Australia."

Connor turned. The voice had come from the far corner of the common room, past the jigsaw table and the guitar player, near the arched doorway that led to the air well. A man was sitting there in one of the mismatched armchairs, one leg crossed over the other, a posture of studied ease. He was tall -- Connor could tell even though the man was seated -- and lean, with close-cropped dark hair and an angular face that looked like it had been designed to sell something expensive. He wore a linen shirt, white, improbably clean for a backpacker hostel, the sleeves rolled to the elbows with a precision that suggested the roll itself had been considered. Leather sandals. No visible tattoos. A thin scar through his left eyebrow, a small imperfection that somehow made the rest of his face more symmetrical.

He was holding two beers. He was smiling. The smile was the kind that created an immediate, instinctive binary in the people who received it: either you trusted this man completely, or you didn't trust him at all. There was no middle register.

Connor, who had never met a stranger he didn't provisionally adore, felt the warmth of the smile before he'd consciously registered the face.

"You look like you could use one of these," the man said, lifting one of the beers. His English was accented -- German, maybe, or Dutch -- and precise, each word placed like a tile in a mosaic.

Connor grinned. The grin was automatic, the same grin he'd flashed at the woman on the plane, at the immigration officer, at the pen-lending father, at Mei Ling. The grin of a man who believed, in his bones, that the world was a friendly place full of friendly people who existed, on some level, to make his journey more interesting.

"Legend," Connor said.

He walked over.

The man extended the beer and, when Connor took it, offered his other hand. The handshake was firm, dry, and lasted exactly the right amount of time.

"Felix," the man said. "Felix Decker. Welcome to The Lantern."

"Connor. Just got in from Bali."

"I know," Felix said, and his smile widened by a fraction. "I can always tell. The tan, the boardshorts, the flip-flops. Bali is a uniform."

Connor laughed. It was a good line. He dropped into the empty chair opposite Felix and cracked the beer. Tiger again. He'd drink anything, but Tiger felt right. Tiger felt like Malaysia.

"How long you been here?" Connor asked.

"At The Lantern? A few weeks. In KL? On and off for a year." Felix sipped his beer. "I travel for work. Photography. KL is a good base."

"Photographer. Sick. I'm sort of in the same space -- social media, content creation, digital nomad stuff." Connor heard himself say these words and felt the usual small thrill of presenting the fiction as fact. It wasn't exactly a lie. He did post things on social media. He had, once, been paid forty dollars to write an Instagram caption for a surf school in Canggu. These facts, arranged correctly, constituted a career.

Felix nodded, and in his nod was something that Connor didn't detect -- a flicker of assessment, the brief, clinical appraisal of a professional evaluating raw material. It was there and gone in less than a second.

"A content creator," Felix said. "I like that. So what's your plan for KL?"

"No plan," Connor said, and he said it the way he always said it -- as a declaration of philosophy, as a badge of identity, as the thing that separated him from the ordinary people back home who planned their lives into submission. "Plans are for amateurs. I just go where the city takes me."

"I like that even more," Felix said. He leaned back in his chair, crossed his ankles, and looked at Connor with an expression of what appeared to be genuine interest. "A man with no plan. KL is a good city for men with no plans. There's always something happening here. You just have to know where to look."

The ceiling fan turned above them. CNN murmured about a crisis in a country Connor couldn't locate on a map. The guitar player had given up and was now examining the instrument with the confused respect of someone who had just been defeated by an inanimate object. Through the air well, the night sounds of Petaling Street were building -- the clink of dishes, the hiss of rain on hot metal, the laughter of people who knew this city and lived in it and belonged to it.

Felix raised his beer. "To no plans," he said.

Connor raised his. "To no plans."

They drank. The beer was cold. The night was warm. The lanterns glowed red above them, and somewhere on the second floor, in an empty dorm, a blue towel hung from a bed frame like a flag of surrender, and a dead girl's name waited in the wood for someone who would never read it.

Connor Briggs was twenty-seven years old, and he had just arrived in the city where he would die, and the city didn't care, and neither did he, and the beers were eight ringgit each, and the night was young, and everything, everything, was going to be fine.
