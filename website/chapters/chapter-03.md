# Chapter 3: Petaling Street

The call to prayer woke him at 5:30 in the morning.

Connor didn't know what it was at first. The sound bled through the dorm's thin walls like something from a dream he was already forgetting -- a long, wavering note that seemed to hang in the humid air, rising and falling, reaching for something beyond the cracked plaster ceiling. He lay in Bed 7, blinking at the underside of the bunk above him, trying to slot the sound into a category his brain could file and dismiss. Not a siren. Not music, exactly. Something older than either.

He pulled his pillow over his head and went back to sleep.

When he woke again, it was ten past nine, and the dorm was empty. Every other bunk was made or unmade but abandoned -- the German guy from Dorm 2 who wore hiking boots to breakfast, the Korean couple who always left before dawn, the silent Scandinavian woman who Connor had never actually heard speak. All gone. Out in the city being productive travelers while Connor lay in his own sweat on a foam mattress that smelled faintly of Tiger Balm and the bodies of everyone who'd slept on it before him.

He checked his phone. Three percent battery. He'd forgotten to charge it again. The Instagram notification count sat at seven -- he tapped it before anything else, the way other people checked for earthquakes or air-raid warnings. Three new followers (all bots), two likes on yesterday's sunset shot from the rooftop, and a comment from his mother: *Please call when you can sweetheart Dad and I worry xx.* He swiped it away. There was also a text from Jake: *dude where are you breakfast is INSANE come to kitchen.* The timestamp said 8:14 AM. An hour ago. Connor groaned, swung his legs off the bunk, and stepped barefoot onto the tile floor.

The tiles were cool and uneven beneath his feet, cracked in geometric patterns that might have been decorative a century ago but now just caught his toes at odd angles. He shuffled out of the dorm and onto the second-floor landing, and the hostel opened up around him in the morning light.

He hadn't really seen it yesterday. He'd arrived in the late afternoon, when the building was all shadows and red lantern glow and the smell of other people's cooking. But now, with the tropical sun pouring through the central air well, The Lantern Hostel revealed itself.

The air well was the building's heart -- a rectangular shaft cut through the center of all three stories, open to the sky. Light fell through it in a solid column, so thick and golden it looked like something you could climb. It illuminated the interior courtyard below: potted ferns with leaves the size of dinner plates, a clothesline heavy with travelers' laundry -- underwear and sarongs and a pair of board shorts that might have been his -- and a mosaic tile bench, chipped and sun-bleached, where someone had left a paperback face-down and open. The walls around the air well were painted white, or had been once, but the tropics had softened them to a mottled cream, blooming with patches of green-grey mould that crept up from the ground floor like the building was slowly returning to jungle.

It was, Connor thought, reaching for the word -- *aesthetic*. His fingers twitched toward his phone before he remembered: three percent. He'd have to charge it before he could capture any of this. The thought caused a small, genuine pang, as though something didn't fully exist until he'd photographed it.

On the second-floor landing, between the bathroom and the stairwell, a section of the wall was different. The paint had peeled away in a rough rectangle, revealing something underneath: characters, painted directly onto the plaster in a faded red-brown. Japanese. Connor didn't read Japanese -- he didn't read anything that wasn't an Instagram caption -- but there was something about the precision of the brushstrokes that made him pause. They looked official. Military, maybe. A sign from the occupation era, from when this building had been something other than a hostel. Something with locked doors and sounds that didn't carry to the street.

He looked at the characters for three seconds, felt nothing he could identify, and went downstairs.

---

The kitchen was on the ground floor, tucked behind the common room, and Mama Siti was in it.

She was there the way a stove is there. Not waiting, not arriving, just *present* -- as though the kitchen had been built around her rather than the other way around. She stood at the counter in a floral housedress that looked older than Connor's parents, her grey hair tucked under a loose headscarf, stirring something in a blackened wok with the practiced economy of someone who had been making the same motion for longer than anyone still alive could confirm. The kitchen smelled extraordinary. Coconut and chili and something frying in hot oil, layered over the deeper base notes of rice steaming and pandan leaves and a sweetness he couldn't place.

Connor stood in the doorway. "Morning," he said, with what he considered charm.

Mama Siti didn't look up. She reached to her left, picked up a banana leaf that had already been arranged into a plate, and loaded it: a mound of rice so white it was almost blue, a splash of red sambal that glistened like lacquer, a scattering of tiny anchovies fried to bronze, a handful of peanuts, a wedge of hard-boiled egg, and a single slice of cucumber. She set it on the counter in front of Connor the way you'd set a bowl of water in front of a dog -- not with unkindness, but with the calm certainty that the creature would do exactly what you expected.

"Erm," Connor said. "How much is--"

"Lima ringgit." Five ringgit. She held up five fingers, then turned back to the wok. Her fingers were knotted and dark, the knuckles swollen in the way that hands get when they've been working for decades without rest.

Connor dug a crumpled blue note from his pocket and placed it on the counter. Mama Siti made it vanish without looking. He picked up the banana leaf plate -- it was warm, the rice still steaming -- and carried it to the communal table, a scarred wooden surface that looked like it had been repurposed from something larger. A dining table, maybe, or a door.

He sat down. He reached for his phone, remembered the battery, and swore under his breath. Three percent was enough for one photo if he was quick. He angled the banana leaf, tried to find the light from the air well, framed the shot --

"Makan dulu."

He looked up. Mama Siti was watching him from the kitchen doorway, arms folded. Her face was a landscape of lines, each one earned, and the expression on it was not quite disapproval and not quite pity. Somewhere between the two. A look that said she had seen this exact scene play out a hundred times, in this exact kitchen, and she already knew how it ended.

"Eat first," she said. "Phone later."

"Yeah, no, I was just going to--"

"*Makan.*"

Connor put the phone down.

He ate.

The nasi lemak was, without exaggeration, the best thing he had eaten in six countries of backpacking. The rice was impossibly fragrant, cooked in coconut milk until each grain was separate and slick and faintly sweet. The sambal hit him three seconds after the first bite -- a slow-building heat that started at the back of his tongue and crawled forward until his eyes watered. The anchovies were salty and crunchy, the peanuts grounding the whole thing with an earthy depth, and the egg was just an egg but somehow better than any egg he'd eaten before, as though Mama Siti had a personal arrangement with the chickens.

"This is incredible," he said, mouth full. "This is actually -- this is amazing."

Mama Siti said nothing. She stood in the kitchen doorway, watching him eat with an expression he couldn't read and wouldn't have tried to read even if he could. Something old and settled and final. The look of someone watching the tide come in, knowing what it would take when it went back out.

Connor didn't notice. He was thinking about how he'd describe the nasi lemak in an Instagram caption. *When the hostel auntie is a better chef than your whole country* with a fire emoji and a Malaysian flag. Something like that. Casual. Relatable. The kind of thing that got engagement.

He finished the plate, wiped the sambal from his lips with the back of his hand, and grinned at her. "Cheers, legend."

Mama Siti turned back to the kitchen. As she went, she said something in Malay, so quietly it might have been to herself, or to the building, or to no one at all.

Connor didn't ask for a translation.

---

Jake was waiting for him in the common room, sprawled across a wicker chair that creaked under his sunburned weight, scrolling his phone with the vacant attention of someone who had no destination and no urgency. He was wearing a backwards San Diego State cap and a shirt that said *I SURVIVED FULL MOON PARTY KOH PHANGAN* in neon lettering. His face lit up when he saw Connor.

"Dude! Finally. I've been waiting like an hour. Did you try the rice thing? The coconut rice?"

"Nasi lemak. And yeah, mate, it was unreal."

"Nah-see lem-ack," Jake repeated, getting it approximately right. "Dude, we should go explore. I heard Petaling Street is like, right outside. It's supposed to be this crazy market."

Connor looked at the common room. Mismatched furniture -- the wicker chair, a vinyl couch with a split down the middle leaking yellow foam, two plastic stools, a beanbag that had seen better decades. A bookshelf of abandoned novels, mostly thrillers and romance, their spines cracked and wavy from humidity. A wall-mounted TV showing CNN with the sound off, the ticker scrolling news that belonged to a world Connor had excused himself from. Above it all, ceiling fans rotated with the hypnotic slowness of things that have given up on urgency.

"Yeah," Connor said. "Let me charge my phone first. I need to film this."

He plugged in at the sole available outlet, the one near the reception desk that every guest in the hostel competed for like animals at a watering hole, and waited for the phone to climb to eleven percent. It would have to do. He had content to create.

---

Petaling Street hit them the way KL hit everyone who wasn't prepared for it: all at once, from every direction, with no mercy and no volume control.

They stepped out of the hostel's narrow doorway -- squeezed between the phone repair shop and the traditional Chinese medicine store, whose window displayed jars of dried things Connor didn't want to identify -- and into the street, and the street swallowed them whole.

The market ran the length of Petaling Street under a permanent canopy of green tarpaulins and corrugated metal that blocked the worst of the sun but trapped the heat like a greenhouse. Stalls lined both sides, stacked with goods that cascaded from tables onto the ground and up the walls: fake Louis Vuitton bags, fake Gucci wallets, fake Ray-Ban sunglasses, fake Beats headphones, fake everything, piled in bright cheap abundance. Between the stalls, in gaps that shouldn't have been wide enough for commerce, vendors had set up food carts -- woks hissing with oil, steamers billowing, grills smoking with satay sticks that sent plumes of charcoal-scented fog into the canopy. The smell was a wall: frying noodles, roasting peanuts, the sulfurous funk of open drains, incense from a temple somewhere nearby, diesel exhaust, and beneath it all, the sweet rot of overripe tropical fruit.

And the noise. Vendors calling out in Cantonese, Mandarin, Malay, English -- "Hey, you want watch? Good price!" "Best bag, real leather!" "Makan, makan, come eat!" -- layered over the rumble of traffic from the streets beyond, motorbike engines revving, a radio playing Cantopop from a hardware stall, the clatter of metal bowls and plastic chairs, the indecipherable hum of a thousand overlapping conversations. Bodies pressed in from all sides -- tourists with cameras, locals with shopping bags, children darting between legs, a man pushing a cart loaded with durian fruit that people stepped away from as if it were radioactive.

Connor raised his phone and pressed record.

"What's up, legends," he said to the camera, adopting the slightly louder, slightly more performative voice he used for content. "Day two in KL, and we're hitting up Petaling Street. This is the famous Chinatown market, and as you can see, it is absolutely *pumping*. Let's go find some bargains."

No one had asked for this. His 4,200 followers -- about five K, he'd tell you -- mostly scrolled past his stories without watching. But Connor filmed with the conviction of someone addressing a vast and hungry audience, panning the phone slowly across the market, zooming in on things that caught his eye, providing commentary that no one would hear.

"Look at this -- fake Rolexes, fake Nikes, fake everything. This is what I love about Asia, man. You can get anything for nothing."

Jake trailed behind him, equally awed but less inclined to narrate. He pointed at things and said "dude" and "no way" at intervals, which was his contribution to most conversations.

They stopped at a stall selling watches. The display was a glass case of imitation luxury, Rolexes and Omegas and Breitlings laid out on velvet in a way that was almost touching in its aspirational sincerity. The vendor, a Chinese Malaysian man in his fifties with reading glasses pushed up on his forehead and an expression of infinite patience, watched Connor approach.

"How much for this one?" Connor picked up a fake Submariner. It was surprisingly heavy.

"Eighty ringgit."

"Eighty? Mate, come on. I'll give you twenty."

The vendor's expression didn't change. "Sixty."

"Twenty-five."

"Fifty. Good price. Best quality."

Connor grinned the grin of someone who had watched three YouTube videos about haggling in Asian markets and now considered himself a master negotiator. "Thirty. Final offer. I'm doing you a favour, there's heaps of these stalls."

The vendor looked at Connor for a long moment. The glasses on his forehead caught the light. He said, in English so precise and clipped it could have cut glass: "Thirty ringgit. For a watch you'll lose in a swimming pool next week. Take it and please stop performing for your telephone."

Jake burst out laughing. Connor's grin faltered for exactly one second before reassembling itself. "Legend," he said, laying the thirty ringgit on the glass case. He strapped the watch to his wrist, held it up to the phone camera. "Just got a Rolex in KL for like seven bucks. This place is unreal."

They moved deeper into the market. Connor filmed everything. He filmed a woman making fresh popiah at her stall, her hands moving with mesmerizing speed, rolling the thin crepe around shredded jicama and peanuts. He didn't ask permission. The woman looked up, saw the phone, and turned her back. He filmed a display of traditional Chinese calligraphy brushes and asked the vendor, "Do you speak English?" The vendor, a woman in her thirties with a university lanyard still hanging from her bag, replied in English with a received pronunciation that made Connor's Australian drawl sound like he was speaking through a mouthful of gravel: "I have a degree in English literature from the University of Malaya. Would you like a recommendation? You seem like you'd enjoy Hemingway. He also mistook brevity for profundity."

Jake laughed so hard he choked on his own spit. Connor said "Sick burn, actually" and moved on, because nothing penetrated, nothing stuck, nothing altered the fundamental architecture of his certainty that the world was a playground built for his amusement.

They passed the Guan Di Temple. It rose from the street like something from a different century, which it was -- red pillars, gold trim, the deep green of glazed roof tiles, and above the entrance, a carved dragon that looked down at the market with an expression of magnificent indifference. Incense smoke drifted from the doorway, sweet and thick, and inside, Connor could see the dim glow of candles and the burnished gold of altar pieces.

"Sick," he said. "Let's check it out."

He walked straight for the entrance in his flip-flops. One foot was on the threshold when a hand caught his arm -- firm, not aggressive, but unmistakably a stop. An elderly Chinese man in a white undershirt, sitting on a plastic stool beside the entrance, shook his head and pointed at Connor's feet. Then at a rack of plastic sandal bags. Then at a sign, written in four languages, that said *PLEASE REMOVE SHOES BEFORE ENTERING*.

"Oh," Connor said. "Right. Yeah. Sorry, mate."

He kicked off his flip-flops, dropped them in a bag, and entered the temple barefoot. The stone floor was cool and smooth, worn by decades of feet that had entered with more reverence than his. The interior was dark after the market's glare, and the smoke from a forest of joss sticks turned the air into something you could almost chew. A massive statue of Guan Di -- the red-faced god of war and righteousness, though Connor didn't know that and wouldn't have been interested -- loomed at the far end, flanked by smaller figures and offerings of oranges and flowers.

Connor raised his phone and took a selfie. Flash on. In a temple.

Jake, to his credit, looked uncomfortable. "Dude, should you be doing that in here?"

"Relax, it's Asia. Everyone takes photos everywhere."

A woman praying at a side altar turned and looked at him. Her look was not the vendor's cutting wit or the calligraphy seller's dry dismissal. It was something quieter and harder to shrug off. Sadness, maybe. The sadness of watching someone walk through a sacred space without seeing it.

Connor didn't see it. He was checking the selfie. The lighting was good.

---

They emerged from the temple and followed their noses to a row of fruit stalls at the edge of the market, where the permanent canopy gave way to a strip of open sky and the sun fell on piles of rambutan, mangosteen, jackfruit, and -- unmistakable, even to someone who'd never encountered it before -- durian.

The smell arrived before the visual. It was a smell that seemed to have ambitions beyond the olfactory, reaching for something truly transcendent in its awfulness -- a concentrated essence of rotting onion, turpentine, old gym sock, and an indefinable sweetness that somehow made the whole thing worse. The durians sat in their spiky green husks, looking like medieval weapons designed by someone with a cruel sense of humour, and the vendor -- a wiry man in a singlet who clearly had no functioning sense of smell -- was hacking one open with a machete.

"Oh my god," Jake said, pulling his shirt over his nose. "What IS that?"

"Durian, bro," Connor said, already filming. "King of fruits. You've got to try it when you're in Southeast Asia. It's like a rite of passage."

He had never tried it. He had seen Instagram posts about trying it. This was functionally the same thing in Connor's epistemology.

"How much?" he asked the vendor, pointing at the open durian.

"Ten ringgit."

Connor paid without bargaining -- the smell had disabled his negotiation instincts -- and the vendor scooped out a segment of the custard-yellow flesh and placed it on a plastic plate. It sat there, glistening, looking like something that had already been eaten once. The smell, freed from the husk, intensified to the point where nearby shoppers visibly adjusted their trajectories.

"This is going to be content gold," Connor told Jake. "Film me."

He handed Jake his phone. Jake held it up with one hand, the other pinching his nose shut. Connor picked up the durian segment, mugged for the camera, and bit into it.

The first thing was the texture -- soft, almost gelatinous, with the consistency of a custard that had lost the will to live. It coated the inside of his mouth immediately, clinging to his teeth, his tongue, the roof of his mouth, as though it were trying to colonize him. Then the flavour arrived. It was not one flavour but several, in rapid and contradictory succession: sweet, then savory, then something that tasted like caramelized onion mixed with vanilla ice cream, then a garlicky aftertaste that had no business being in a fruit, and through all of it, the *smell*, which was now coming from inside him, rising through his sinuses and establishing a permanent camp behind his eyes.

Connor's face went through a full cycle of human emotion in about four seconds. Surprise. Confusion. Dawning horror. A brief, wild-eyed moment of wondering if this was poisonous. And then, inevitably, the gag.

He lurched forward, one hand on his knee, the other still holding the half-eaten durian segment, and produced a sound that was somewhere between a cough, a retch, and a prayer. He didn't actually vomit -- he would later insist on this, on his Instagram story, with the passion of someone defending a war record -- but it was a near thing. His body convulsed. His eyes streamed. A small, involuntary whimper escaped his lips.

Jake, filming, was laughing so hard that the footage would be unusable -- just shaking and wheezing and Jake's voice saying "dude -- dude -- DUDE --" between gasps.

The durian vendor watched with the detached amusement of a man who had seen this performance approximately eight thousand times. He leaned against his stall, arms crossed, and when Connor finally straightened up, red-faced and watery-eyed, the vendor offered him a single piece of practical advice.

"Next time, don't breathe through nose."

"Cheers," Connor croaked. He looked at the durian segment in his hand, looked at the camera, and -- because content was content -- took another bite. This time he chewed with his mouth open, breathing through his mouth like a drowning man, and managed to swallow. He gave the camera a thumbs-up with the expression of someone who has just been informed of a family death.

"That," he said, "is an acquired taste."

The vendor said nothing. He was already serving the next customer, a local woman who ate her durian with the relaxed pleasure of someone enjoying ice cream on a park bench.

---

The hawker center was two streets behind Petaling Street, down a narrow lane that smelled of drains and jasmine, in a covered open-air space filled with plastic tables and metal stools that had been welded together in configurations that discouraged comfort. The lunch rush was on. Every table was occupied by people eating with the focused intensity that Malaysians brought to food -- heads down, elbows out, the conversation secondary to the meal.

Connor and Jake found a table with two empty spots at the end, across from someone who was already sitting there. They sat down without asking, because that was how hawker centers worked -- Connor knew this from a YouTube travel channel, one of the few pieces of cultural research he'd ever conducted.

The person across from them was a woman. She was young -- mid-twenties, Connor estimated -- with dark skin and long black hair pulled into a practical braid that hung over one shoulder. She wore round glasses, the kind that looked like they'd been chosen for function rather than fashion, and a plain grey T-shirt and jeans. No jewelry. No visible brand logos. No effort, Connor thought, to project a curated identity -- which was, in his worldview, almost as baffling as the durian.

She was reading a book. Not a phone, not a Kindle -- an actual physical book, a Lonely Planet guide so battered it was held together with rubber bands. She was eating roti canai with one hand and turning pages with the other, her eyes tracking lines of text with the focused attention of someone used to processing large volumes of information. A cup of teh tarik sat at her elbow, milky and sweet-smelling, half-finished.

Connor noticed her immediately, because Connor always noticed women, the way a satellite dish always points at the sky. But there was something else -- something about the self-sufficiency of the scene, the completeness of a person who needed nothing beyond a book and a meal and a table. She looked like she belonged here, even though she clearly wasn't local. She looked like she'd done her homework.

"That any good?" Connor asked, nodding at the roti canai.

She looked up. Brown eyes behind the round glasses, sharp and assessing. She took him in -- the man-bun, the singlet, the fake Rolex, the flip-flops, the phone lying on the table like an extra organ -- and something moved behind her expression. Not interest. Not disinterest. Categorization.

"It's excellent," she said. London accent, precise, the vowels clipped in a way that made Connor's Australian sound like it was melting. "The dhal is particularly good here. They use fresh curry leaves."

"Sick. I'll get some. I'm Connor, by the way. This is Jake."

"Priya," she said, and went back to her book.

Connor was not deterred by disinterest. Connor was never deterred by disinterest. Disinterest was, in his experience, just interest that hadn't been properly introduced to his personality.

"What are you reading? Like, I know it's a Lonely Planet, but what section?"

Priya pushed her glasses up her nose. "The legal section. Malaysian civil and criminal law."

Connor stared at her. Then he laughed -- a genuine, full-bodied laugh that turned heads at the next table. "You're actually reading the *rules section*? That's like reading the terms and conditions. Nobody does that."

"Everybody should do that," Priya said, without smiling. "Especially in a country where the legal system is significantly different from whatever you're used to."

"What are they going to do, arrest me for being too good-looking?"

She did smile then, despite herself. Just a flicker at the corner of her mouth, barely enough to register, but Connor saw it and felt the small, warm hit of dopamine that came from making a pretty girl crack. He leaned back in his chair, arms behind his head, the fake Rolex catching the light.

"Where are you from?" he asked.

"London."

"Travelling long?"

"Six weeks. I'm a medical student. This is my break before final year."

"A doctor! Legend. So you're on holiday and you're doing *homework*." He gestured at the guidebook. "That's dedication."

"It's common sense," Priya said. She turned the guidebook toward him, tapping a section of text. "Did you know that Malaysia has a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking? Not just dealing -- even carrying above certain amounts. Fifty grams of methamphetamine, for instance. That's less than the weight of a candy bar."

Connor's expression didn't change. He heard the words -- *mandatory death penalty* -- the way he heard all words that didn't directly relate to his immediate comfort: they entered his ears, grazed the surface of his brain, and slid off without leaving a mark.

"Heavy," he said. "You might want to tell that to the actual drug dealers though, not the tourists."

"Tourists get caught too. That's rather the point."

"Yeah, but--" He waved a hand, the universal gesture of someone dismissing information they haven't processed. "That's like, big-time dealer stuff. Cartels and all that. They're not going to hang some backpacker for having a good time."

Priya looked at him for a long moment. "You might want to read this section," she said, pushing the book slightly closer.

"Why? Are they going to arrest me for being too good-looking?" He said it again, grinning, because in Connor's world, a line that worked once would work forever.

"You already used that one," Priya said, but she was smiling now, properly, the kind of smile that acknowledged the joke was terrible while conceding that the delivery had a certain brainless charm. She closed the guidebook and took a sip of her teh tarik. "Where are you staying?"

"The Lantern. In Chinatown. It's this old shophouse place, really cool."

"I know it. I'm staying there too. Dorm four."

"No way. I'm in three. We're practically neighbours."

"Practically."

Connor ordered roti canai from a passing hawker -- pointing at Priya's plate and holding up two fingers, because ordering by imitation was easier than learning words -- and when the food arrived, he ate it with the messy enthusiasm he brought to everything. Priya ate neatly, methodically, and asked him questions with the diagnostic precision of someone trained to take patient histories. Where was he from? (Melbourne.) How long had he been travelling? (Four years, on and off.) What did he do for work? (Digital consulting, very flexible, location-independent.) Had he been to KL before? (Nah, first time, just vibing.)

She didn't challenge his answers directly. She just listened with an attentiveness that Connor found flattering and slightly unnerving, as though she were running his responses through some internal diagnostic algorithm and noting the results without sharing them.

Jake, meanwhile, had ordered a plate of char kway teow and was eating it with the focused joy of a golden retriever encountering a steak. He contributed to the conversation at intervals -- "Dude, this is so good" and "Wait, you're going to be a doctor? That's sick" -- before returning to his noodles with the contentment of someone for whom the present moment was the only moment that existed.

"Your friend is having a good time," Priya observed.

"Jake's having the time of his life. Jake's always having the time of his life. It's his superpower."

"And yours?"

Connor thought about this for less than a second. "Being in the right place at the right time."

Priya said nothing to this, but she pushed her glasses up her nose -- the gesture Connor would come to learn meant she was filing something away for later examination -- and something in her expression shifted. Not suspicion. Not attraction. Something in between, something careful and curious and, beneath it all, concerned. As though she'd just heard a cough in a patient's chest and was deciding whether to order an X-ray.

---

They walked back toward the hostel in the early afternoon, the three of them, through the thinning market crowds and down the side streets where the tourist chaos of Petaling Street softened into something older and quieter. Here the shophouses leaned together over narrow lanes like old men sharing secrets, their facades layered with decades of paint and wire and air-conditioning units bolted to walls at precarious angles. Laundry hung from upper windows. A cat slept on a parked motorbike. The heat sat on everything like a physical weight.

It was in one of these side lanes, between a shuttered hardware store and a wall of peeling movie posters in Chinese, that Connor saw the graffiti.

It was written in black marker on a stretch of grey concrete wall, at about head height, in a hand that was neat and deliberate -- not a rushed tag, but something placed there with intention. Two words and a symbol:

**@HostelReaper**

Below the words, drawn with the same black marker, a small icon: a robed figure holding a scythe, rendered in a few simple lines but unmistakable. And beneath that, in smaller lettering:

*Check-in is optional. Check-out is not.*

Connor stopped. He raised his phone and photographed it. The composition was good -- the dark marker against the grey wall, the peeling posters in the background, the heat-shimmer in the air giving the whole thing a faintly hallucinatory quality.

"Sick street art," he said.

Jake leaned in. "What's a Hostel Reaper?"

Connor shrugged. "Probably some band or something. Or like, a travel account. There's heaps of these edgy backpacker brands."

Priya had stopped a few steps ahead and was looking back at them. She looked at the graffiti. She didn't take a photo. She adjusted her glasses and said nothing, but her eyes stayed on the words a beat longer than Connor's had.

They walked on. The graffiti stayed. The afternoon heat pressed down on the lane, and the small reaper figure stared out from the wall with the patient attention of something that had all the time in the world, because it did.

---

The common room of The Lantern Hostel was cooler than the street but not by much. The ceiling fans turned with their eternal reluctance, pushing the humid air around in slow circles that accomplished nothing but the illusion of effort. CNN murmured from the wall-mounted TV. The bookshelf of abandoned novels -- their spines warped, their pages thick with absorbed moisture -- stood against the far wall like a monument to every traveler who had ever left something behind.

Priya settled into the vinyl couch with her guidebook, folding her legs beneath her and propping the battered Lonely Planet against her knee. She was already lost in it before Connor and Jake had finished kicking off their flip-flops. She read the way some people meditate: fully, completely, as though the rest of the room had been dimmed to nothing.

Connor sat in the wicker chair, his phone charging at the outlet by reception, and scrolled through the photos from the day. The market stalls. The fake Rolex on his wrist. The durian selfie -- his face red, eyes streaming, a comedy of suffering that would get more engagement than anything genuine ever could. The calligraphy brushes. The temple. The roti canai. The graffiti.

He was curating the day into a story that bore an approximate relationship to the day he'd actually had. The vendors' cutting English became "hilarious locals." The temple became "incredible vibes." The durian became "I nearly died lol." The girl with the guidebook became -- he wasn't sure yet. He didn't post about girls he'd just met. That was a later move, a week-two move, when the story had developed enough to be captioned.

His phone buzzed. A text message, not a notification. From Felix.

*Free tonight? Got something fun planned.*

Connor looked at the message. He looked at Priya, who was curled on the couch with her guidebook, the afternoon light from the air well falling across her in a warm stripe, turning the pages gold. She was reading with her lips slightly parted, the way people do when they're genuinely absorbed, and her braid had come partially undone, dark hair falling across her face. She pushed it back absently. She didn't look up.

Connor looked at his phone.

He typed a thumbs-up emoji and hit send.

He put the phone down and leaned back in the wicker chair, which creaked under him like the building sighing. On the TV, CNN was showing something about trade agreements. The ceiling fans turned. From the kitchen, the distant sound of Mama Siti washing pans, a rhythmic clang that sounded almost like a bell, or a warning.

Priya looked up from her guidebook. She'd caught something -- not the text, she was too far away for that, but something in his posture, the small shift in his body language when the message arrived. The way he'd leaned forward, then leaned back. The way his thumb had moved with a decisiveness the rest of him rarely showed.

"Who's that?" she asked.

"Just a mate," Connor said. "The German."

Something crossed Priya's face. Not suspicion -- the architecture of suspicion hadn't been built yet, there were no foundations, no framework, just an empty lot where something would eventually be constructed. What crossed her face was something earlier and smaller: attention. The slight narrowing of the eyes, the fractional tilt of the head, the medical student's instinct for symptoms that didn't quite add up. She looked at Connor, and Connor looked back at her, and for a moment the common room was very quiet except for the fans and the TV and Mama Siti's pans.

Then Priya smiled. "Have fun," she said, and went back to her book.
