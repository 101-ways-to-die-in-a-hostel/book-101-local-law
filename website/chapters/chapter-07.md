# Chapter 7: The Law You Don't Know

The toaster was trying to kill him.

Not in the Malaysian way -- not with the slow, systemic patience of a country whose legal code contained provisions that Connor Briggs had never read and would never read until the provisions were being read to him in a courtroom. No, this was more immediate. The toaster in the communal kitchen of The Lantern Hostel was a chrome relic of indeterminate origin, its brand name worn to a smear by years of backpacker abuse, and it had two settings: nothing, and inferno. Connor had inserted two slices of the hostel's complimentary white bread -- the kind of bread that existed in a quantum state between food and packing material -- and pressed the lever. The lever had refused to stay down. He'd pressed it again, harder. It had sprung back with a metallic complaint. He'd pressed it a third time, holding it with his thumb, and the element had glowed orange with a suddenness that suggested it had been waiting to do this, that the toaster had opinions about the people who used it and had chosen violence.

"Come on, you piece of--"

"Tekan sini."

The voice came from behind him, low and unhurried, and accompanied by a hand that reached past his elbow and pressed a small button on the side of the toaster he hadn't noticed. The lever clicked and held. The element settled into a steady glow. Toast commenced.

Connor turned. Mama Siti stood at the counter behind him, already back to her own station, already in motion, as if helping him with the toaster had been a thing that happened between moments rather than within one. She was small -- not just short but condensed, as if time had been slowly pressing her down toward the earth and she had responded by becoming denser rather than smaller. Her headscarf was white, clean, wrapped in a style that Connor couldn't have described but that looked deliberate and ancient, like a piece of origami that had been folded the same way for centuries. Her face was a landscape of lines -- deep grooves around her mouth, crow's feet that radiated from her eyes like the spokes of a wheel, the particular weathering of skin that has been exposed to tropical humidity and cooking steam for longer than most of the hostel's guests had been alive. She claimed to be sixty-eight. The building's foundations believed otherwise.

She was making nasi lemak, and the kitchen was her temple.

The hostel kitchen was a galley-sized strip of countertop, tile, and compromise, wedged between the common room and the air well courtyard. It contained one stove (gas, temperamental), one rice cooker (industrial, the only appliance that functioned without argument), a microwave that smelled permanently of someone's leftover curry, and a refrigerator whose interior represented a kind of archaeological dig through the dietary habits of a dozen nations -- jars of kimchi next to tubes of Vegemite next to plastic containers of something that might have been hummus or might have been a biohazard, all of it sweating in the tropical air whenever the fridge door opened, which was constantly. The kitchen was cramped, warm, perpetually crowded with backpackers trying to boil water for instant noodles or assemble sandwiches from ingredients they'd optimistically purchased at the 7-Eleven on the corner. It smelled of cooking oil and chilli and the ghost of a thousand meals.

But at 6 AM, before the backpackers stirred, the kitchen belonged to Mama Siti.

She had been there when Connor came downstairs, bleary-eyed, his hair a disaster, wearing the board shorts he'd slept in and a singlet that read CANGGU SURF CO. She was always there. She arrived at five, or she never left, or she materialised from the building's fabric like a spirit of the hearth -- the specifics were unclear and no one asked. What was clear was the food. The coconut rice was already steaming in the rice cooker, the sambal was bubbling in a small pot that seemed to be as old as she was, and the ikan bilis -- the tiny dried anchovies -- were frying in a shallow pan of oil, their bodies curling in the heat, filling the ground floor with a smell that was simultaneously fishy, nutty, and addictive. Roasted peanuts sat in a bowl. Hard-boiled eggs, halved, waited on a plate. Cucumber slices, cool and green, were arranged in a neat row on a cutting board.

She assembled a plate without being asked. She always knew who needed feeding. It was, Connor had decided during his seven days at The Lantern, one of the small miracles of hostel life -- that this ancient woman appeared every morning and produced food that was, objectively and without exaggeration, the best thing he'd eaten in any country, and that this food cost five ringgit, which was about a dollar fifty Australian, which was less than he'd pay for a bad coffee in Hawthorn.

She placed the plate in front of him. The nasi lemak was perfect: the coconut rice in a tight mound, glossy and fragrant, flanked by the sambal -- deep red, volcanic, flecked with dried shrimp and chilli seeds -- the anchovies crisp and golden, the peanuts scattered like small brown stones, the egg halved to show its pale yellow heart, the cucumber as an afterthought of freshness. It was beautiful in the way that food prepared by someone who has made the same dish ten thousand times is beautiful -- not arranged but inevitable, each element finding its correct position through the muscle memory of decades.

Connor ate. He made the sounds that the nasi lemak demanded -- small involuntary noises of gratitude that bypassed his brain entirely and came from somewhere deeper, somewhere that understood food in a way his conscious mind, with its Instagram filters and its #foodie hashtags, never would.

"Mama Siti," he said, mouth full, fork raised in a gesture of reverence, "this is unreal. Seriously. You could open a restaurant. You'd make a killing."

She didn't turn from the stove. She made a sound -- a soft exhalation through the nose -- that could have been acknowledgment or dismissal or both.

"I'm serious," Connor pressed. "Back in Melbourne, people pay thirty bucks for brunch that's half as good as this. You could charge whatever you wanted."

Now she turned. She looked at him with those dark eyes -- eyes that were not unkind but were very, very old, the kind of old that comes not from years alone but from having watched years pass over and over and over again, each one carrying away someone who sat where Connor sat now, eating what Connor ate now, saying what Connor said now.

"Ini bukan tentang wang," she said quietly. This is not about money.

"Yeah, nah, I know, but--"

"Orang yang tak tahu undang-undang," she said, and her voice changed. Not louder -- softer, actually, as if the words were being spoken from a distance, from a place behind her eyes where the kitchen and the hostel and the present moment were thin layers over something deeper. "Undang-undang tak tahu dia."

Connor paused, a forkful of sambal-drenched rice halfway to his mouth. "What's that mean?"

Mama Siti turned the stove down. The sambal stopped bubbling. In the sudden quiet, Connor could hear the morning call to prayer from Masjid Jamek, faint but clear through the air well, a human voice rising over the city in a melody that was simultaneously alien and familiar, like a memory from a life he hadn't lived.

She considered the question. Not the way people consider questions when they're translating -- she spoke English perfectly well, everyone knew that. She considered it the way a doctor considers how much to tell a patient.

"The man who does not know the law," she said, "the law does not know him."

Connor chewed. Swallowed. "Is that a good thing or a bad thing?"

She wiped her hands on the cloth that hung from her waistband, a slow and deliberate motion. "When the law comes," she said, "it does not ask if you know its name."

The words settled between them like something dropped into water, sending out ripples that Connor couldn't see and wouldn't feel until they reached the shore of a moment he hadn't arrived at yet. He blinked. The nasi lemak was getting cold. The call to prayer was fading. Mama Siti was looking at him -- really looking, the way you look at someone standing at the edge of a cliff who thinks they're standing on flat ground. Her eyes held something that wasn't warning, exactly, and wasn't pity, exactly, but sat in the unnamed space between the two where the old women of the world keep their most terrible knowledge.

"Hey," Connor said, "do you have any hot sauce?"

The look lingered. It lingered for one full second longer than was comfortable, long enough that a more attentive person might have felt the hairs rise on the back of their neck, might have put down the fork and said *What do you mean? What law? Why are you looking at me like that?* A second that contained, compressed within it, the full weight of everything Mama Siti knew and could not say directly, because prophecy, like cooking, had rules -- you could not force someone to taste what they refused to put in their mouth.

Then she reached behind her and produced a bottle of sambal from the shelf. She set it in front of him.

"You already have all the fire you need," she said.

She turned back to the stove. The sambal began to bubble again. The moment closed over itself like water, leaving no visible trace.

Connor upended the bottle over his nasi lemak, dousing it in additional chilli, and ate with the uncomplicated pleasure of a man who had been handed a prophecy and mistaken it for condiment advice. He finished the plate, left five ringgit on the counter, and headed upstairs to shower.

Mama Siti stood at the stove and watched the sambal turn in the pot, the same slow red circles it had been making since before this building was a hostel, since before the boy upstairs was born, since before the law he did not know was written on the paper he would never read.

She picked up his plate and washed it. She washed all the plates eventually.

Priya was waiting for him in the common room at nine, her battered Lonely Planet held against her chest like a shield, her round glasses pushed up on her forehead, her long braid swinging as she turned to face him. She was wearing jeans and a loose cotton shirt and trainers -- practical, appropriate, researched. She looked like she was going somewhere specific, which she was.

"I want to visit Masjid Jamek," she said.

"The what?"

"Masjid Jamek. One of the oldest mosques in KL. It's at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers." She said this the way she said most things -- with the quiet authority of someone who had read the relevant chapter. "It's beautiful. Mughal-style architecture. I've been wanting to see it all week."

Connor rubbed his wet hair with the sleeve of his singlet. "A mosque?"

"A mosque."

"Like a... praying mosque?"

Priya's expression performed a complex operation -- the smile that wanted to happen was intercepted by the eye-roll that deserved to happen, and the result was something in between: an expression of fond exasperation that Connor had become increasingly familiar with over the past seven days. It was the look she gave him when he said things that were not quite stupid enough to be offensive but not quite smart enough to let pass.

"Yes, Connor. A praying mosque. As opposed to the other kind."

"I just meant -- I'm not really a mosque guy. I'm more of a... beach guy."

"We're in Kuala Lumpur. There are no beaches."

"There might be."

"There are not." She tucked the guidebook under her arm. "Come with me. You'll like it. And you need to see something in this city that isn't a bar or a night market."

He should have said no. He had no interest in mosques, in architecture, in the history of a city he'd been in for a week and still thought of primarily as a backdrop for content. But Priya was standing there in the warm light of the common room, her dark skin luminous against the white of her shirt, her eyes bright behind the glasses that had slipped back down to the bridge of her nose, and she was asking him to spend the morning with her, and Connor Briggs was many things -- ignorant, reckless, dangerously incurious about the world he moved through -- but he was not immune to Priya Sharma.

"Yeah, go on then," he said.

They walked.

KL in the morning was a different beast from KL at night -- shopkeepers hosing down pavements, roti canai frying at corner stalls, the particular golden quality of equatorial morning light hitting old plaster. They followed the river past colonial-era buildings and through the edges of the financial district.

"KL means 'muddy confluence,'" Priya said, gesturing at the brown river below the bridge they were crossing. "It was literally named for the mud where these two rivers meet."

"That's sick," Connor said. "Like, literally muddy? Gross."

She rolled her eyes but smiled, and the smile was the thing he was after -- the crack in her composure, the moment where her curated intelligence gave way to something warmer. He collected those smiles the way he collected everything: casually, greedily, without understanding their value.

They approached Masjid Jamek from the south. The mosque sat at the actual confluence, the two rivers meeting at its feet -- white stone and onion domes and arched colonnades, salmon pink stripes catching the morning light.

"Wow," Connor said, and meant it.

"Built in 1909," Priya said. "Mughal and Moorish style."

"You memorised that?"

"I read a book, Connor. You should try it sometime."

They crossed to the entrance, where signs in Malay and English explained the rules for visitors. Priya had already read them. Connor had not.

He was two steps from the entrance when she caught his arm.

"Connor."

"What?"

She looked at him. Then she looked at his outfit. He followed her gaze. Board shorts. The Bintang Beer singlet. Flip-flops. The compass tattoo visible on his forearm. He looked like what he was: an Australian backpacker who had rolled out of a hostel and into a sacred space with all the preparation of a man stumbling into the wrong room at a party.

"You can't go in like that," Priya said. Her voice was patient but firm -- the voice of a medical student explaining to a patient why, no, they couldn't just take the bandage off because it itched.

"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?"

"Everything. Shoulders need to be covered. Legs need to be covered. No shoes inside. This is a mosque, not a beach bar."

"Seriously?"

"Seriously."

He looked at the entrance. A rack stood to one side, hung with folded garments -- robes for men, longer coverings for women -- provided by the mosque for visitors who hadn't come prepared. A sign above the rack, in English: PLEASE DRESS RESPECTFULLY. COVERINGS PROVIDED. Connor looked at the sign. For once, he actually read it.

"So I wear one of those?"

"They're sarongs and robes. Yes."

"Like a skirt?"

"Like a sarong. And you're a guest in their sacred space, Connor."

The words landed with a weight that Connor didn't expect. *A guest in their sacred space.* He thought about that for a moment. He was always a guest, everywhere -- that was the point of travel, wasn't it, being a guest in places that weren't yours? But he'd never thought about what that word actually meant. A guest had obligations. A guest behaved. A guest didn't walk into someone's house in flip-flops and a beer singlet and expect the house to accommodate them.

He was not, by nature, a man who was chastened. But Priya had a way of framing things that got through -- not by lecturing, not by shaming, but by presenting the reality so simply that even Connor's defenses couldn't find a way to deflect it.

"Right," he said. "Yeah. Fair enough."

He selected a robe from the rack -- pale green, long, lightweight cotton -- and pulled it on over his singlet and shorts. He removed his flip-flops and placed them on the shoe rack, where they sat among dozens of other pairs: leather sandals, trainers, delicate women's shoes, and his battered Havaianas, the most disreputable items in the collection by a considerable margin. Priya had already wrapped a scarf around her hair, borrowed from the women's section, and was adjusting it in the reflection of the glass door.

"How do I look?" Connor asked, holding out his arms. The robe hung to his shins, and with his sun-bleached hair and stubbled jaw and the green fabric draping loosely over his board shorts, he looked like a surfer who'd been press-ganged into a nativity play.

"You look appropriate," Priya said. "For once."

"Harsh."

"Accurate."

They stepped inside.

---

The interior of Masjid Jamek was cool -- not air-conditioned but the coolness of marble and shade and water, a building designed to shelter people from equatorial heat. After the furnace of the street, it was a physical relief.

Connor stood in the main prayer hall and felt something shift.

White marble columns rose to pointed arches, the geometry repeating in a rhythm that drew the eye upward toward the dome, where light entered through small windows and fell in soft shafts to the floor. Against one wall, the mihrab -- Priya murmured the word, indicating the direction of Mecca -- was decorated with geometric patterns in gold and blue, the kind of design that rewarded attention in a way that Connor's attention was almost never rewarded.

But the sound. From somewhere outside, ablution fountains were running -- a gentle splash of water on stone that entered the prayer hall as a presence rather than a noise. And woven through it: silence. Not the absence of sound, but the particular hush of a space consecrated for listening to something beyond human speech.

Connor stood still. This was rare. Stillness was not his natural state. But here, in the cool marble silence, something in him stopped. The constant, exhausting performance of being Connor Briggs fell away, and what was left was just a person in a beautiful building, breathing cool air, not filming anything.

Priya was watching him. Her borrowed scarf framed her face, and her expression was softer than the fond exasperation he was used to. She was seeing something in him that he rarely showed -- a capacity for genuine experience, for being present without trying to extract content from it.

The moment lasted perhaps thirty seconds.

Then Connor took out his phone, turned the camera on himself, and took a selfie with the dome behind him, angling his jaw to catch the light, deploying the travel-selfie face he'd perfected over four years and twelve countries: slightly squinted eyes, half-smile, chin tilted up. The prayer hall became a backdrop. The awe became content.

"Delete that," Priya said.

"What? Why?"

"Because this is a mosque, not a photo studio. And because the moment you had just then -- that real one, before the phone came out -- was worth more than anything you'll ever post."

Connor looked at her. She was serious. Not angry, not lecturing -- serious in the way that people are serious when they've seen something valuable being discarded.

He looked at the selfie on his screen. He looked good. The light was incredible. The dome behind him was perfectly framed. It would do well on the grid, definitely break a hundred likes, maybe more with the right hashtags -- #malaysia #mosque #travel #culture --

He deleted it.

He didn't know why. Something about Priya's face, something about the quality of the silence. He put his phone in his pocket and stood there, empty-handed, in a sacred space, genuinely present.

"Good," Priya said softly.

They stayed for another twenty minutes. Connor listened while Priya read the plaques and explained the architecture. He didn't retain much, but he listened, and listening was enough.

When they left, stepping back into the assault of heat and noise, he put his flip-flops on and hung the robe back on the rack and became, once again, a backpacker in board shorts squinting in the sun.

"Thanks," he said.

"For what?"

"I dunno. That was... yeah. That was something."

She took his hand briefly and squeezed it, and they walked back toward Petaling Street, and Connor did not film any of it, which was, by his standards, an act of extraordinary restraint.

He would not visit another mosque. The moment in the prayer hall would sink below the surface of his days, joining the other moments of genuine experience that accumulated beneath the performance of his life like coins at the bottom of a pool -- visible if you looked, unreachable if you didn't dive. But it had happened. And Priya had seen it.

---

The common room was full by eight o'clock, and someone had turned on the TV.

The screen -- perpetually smeared with fingerprints, its remote held together with tape -- was showing a documentary. Someone had been flipping channels and landed here by accident or inertia.

The documentary was about drug trafficking in Southeast Asia.

Connor was on the sofa, a Tiger in his hand, Priya beside him reading her guidebook, Jake on the floor scrolling his phone. Two Swedish girls occupied the armchairs. A solo Korean traveler sat cross-legged on the beanbag.

The documentary was well-made. The camera work was careful, the narration measured, the kind of production that had been funded by a European public broadcaster and took its subject seriously. It opened with aerial footage of the Golden Triangle -- where Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar meet -- the green hills and brown rivers filmed from above with a drone, beautiful and ominous. Then it moved south. Malaysia. Indonesia. The Philippines. The supply chains. The couriers. The arrests.

A map appeared on screen, red lines tracing drug routes through Southeast Asia. The narrator's voice -- British, female, steady -- explained: "Malaysia remains one of the world's strictest jurisdictions for drug offenses. Under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952, trafficking in certain quantities of controlled substances carries a mandatory sentence."

Cut to a courtroom. Malaysian. High-ceilinged, wood-panelled, a judge in robes, the formality of the setting absolute. A defendant in a dock. The camera didn't show his face yet -- just his hands, cuffed, resting on the wood in front of him. The narrator continued:

"The mandatory sentence for drug trafficking above threshold amounts -- as little as fifteen grams of heroin, or fifty grams of methamphetamine -- is death."

The common room was quiet. Not the comfortable quiet of before, but the tight, attentive quiet of people receiving information they didn't want. The Swedish girls had stopped talking. Jake's thumb had paused on his phone screen. The Korean traveler looked up from his beanbag.

The camera moved to the defendant's face.

He was young. Western. Maybe twenty-five, maybe younger -- hard to tell because his face had the collapsed quality of a person who has not slept in a very long time and has been crying and has stopped. His hair was light brown, overgrown. His eyes were fixed on something beyond the courtroom walls, something internal and unimaginable.

He looked like someone Connor might meet in a hostel.

The judge spoke. The subtitles translated: "This court finds the accused guilty under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. The sentence of this court is that you shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead."

The screen cut to exterior footage of a prison -- high walls, barbed wire, the Malaysian flag hanging limp.

Something cold moved through Connor's gut. Pre-thought. The body's own intelligence recognising threat before the conscious mind had finished constructing its denial. The young man on screen had blue eyes. Not quite the same blue as Connor's, but close enough.

For a synapse-thin fraction of a second, Connor saw himself in the dock.

The fraction passed.

Connor reached for the remote. It was on the sofa cushion beside him, half-buried under Priya's guidebook. He picked it up and changed the channel.

A football match appeared. Manchester City versus somebody. Green grass, running figures, the roar of a crowd. The screen flooded with colour and motion and the comfortable, comprehensible drama of sport.

"That's heavy, man," Connor said. His voice was light. His voice was always light. "Can we not?"

Jake, from the floor: "Yeah. Yeah, put the game on. Who's playing?"

"City, looks like."

"Sick."

The common room exhaled. Shoulders dropped. Someone reached for their beer. The two Swedish girls resumed their conversation. The Korean traveler returned to his book. The French couple drifted away. The documentary was gone, replaced by football, and the cold thing in Connor's gut receded, pushed down by the beer and the noise and the comfortable fiction that the screen now provided -- a world where the stakes were points and trophies and where nothing permanent ever happened.

Priya did not resume reading her guidebook.

She sat very still, looking at the side of Connor's face. Her expression was complicated -- layers of emotion stacked like geological strata, each one partially visible through the one above. Concern. Frustration. Something deeper and sadder that she couldn't quite name, the feeling you get when you watch someone walk toward an edge they can't see and you know that shouting will only make them walk faster.

She didn't say anything. Not yet. She turned back to the screen, where Manchester City was pushing forward on the counterattack, and she held her guidebook in her lap -- open, still, to the page about Malaysian law, the section about the Dangerous Drugs Act, the paragraph about the mandatory death penalty that Connor had never read and would never read and that was, at this moment, four inches from his right thigh.

He didn't look down. He watched the football. He drank his beer.

The documentary was gone. The young man in the courtroom was gone. The cold feeling was gone. Connor Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian, had been shown the truth -- clearly, directly, on a screen three meters from his face, in a language he understood, with subtitles -- and he had picked up the remote and changed the channel.

The thing about changing the channel is that it only changes what you see. It doesn't change what's there.

---

Connor and Priya sat on the mosaic bench in the air well courtyard at half past eleven, the red lantern casting its warm glow above them. The hostel was quiet -- that particular deep quiet of midnight, the layered breathing of dozens of sleeping strangers. Through the open rectangle of sky above, the faint suggestion of stars through KL's orange haze.

Priya was close beside him. Not touching, but close -- the careful proximity of two people who have been circling each other for a week. Her glasses were off, folded in her lap, and without them her face looked softer, younger. She was looking up at the sky.

"Connor," she said. "Have you looked into Malaysian laws? At all?"

"What, like jaywalking?"

Her eyes, without the glasses, were large and serious. "Like drug laws."

"Oh, come on--"

"They have the death penalty here, Connor. For trafficking. Mandatory. As little as fifty grams."

He sighed -- the defence mechanism, the sound that said *we're not doing this.* "Yeah, but that's for actual drug dealers. Kingpins. Not backpackers."

"That's not how the law works. It doesn't matter who you are."

"I'm not carrying any drugs," he said.

"I know. I'm just saying. Be careful. This isn't Australia."

"You worry too much."

She looked at him -- a long, searching look, the medical student's diagnostic eye at work. She wanted to ask about Felix. About the envelopes, the "side hustle," the RM200 deposits. But the evidence was circumstantial, and she didn't want to accuse, and she didn't want to ruin the moment.

Connor kissed her.

Partly because he'd wanted to for days. And partly to stop the conversation -- the questions getting closer to something he didn't want to examine, something that lived in the same territory as the cold feeling from the documentary, as Mama Siti's eyes across the kitchen counter. A kiss was a channel change.

She tasted of teh tarik and spearmint gum and herself, warm and alive in the red lantern light. She kissed him back with a tenderness that was also, underneath, a kind of grief, though he couldn't have known that and she might not have known it either.

They pulled apart.

Priya smiled. The smile was small and genuine and more complicated than any selfie could capture.

Connor smiled. His smile was larger, more confident, the smile of a man who had gotten what he wanted, which was both the kiss and the end of the conversation.

His phone buzzed in his pocket.

The vibration was a single pulse against his thigh -- short, insistent, unmistakably a text. He pulled the phone out, angled the screen away from Priya -- a reflex, automatic, the muscle memory of a man who'd been reading his phone privately for long enough that the gesture was invisible to him even when it shouldn't have been.

The screen lit up. A message from Felix:

*Morning job tomorrow. RM300 this time. Package, not envelope. Same deal. You in?*

Connor read the message twice. RM300. Nearly a hundred Australian dollars for a single delivery. That was more than his monthly social media client paid. That was breathing room.

The other thing -- *package, not envelope* -- sat in the message like a step on a staircase that was noticeably higher than the one before it. He did not examine the progression. He did not think about the young man in the courtroom documentary.

He looked at Priya, her face soft in the lantern light. She was trying to save him, and he didn't know it.

He texted back, holding the phone under the bench where she couldn't see:

*In.*

"Who was that?" Priya asked.

"Just Mum," Connor said. "Checking in."

The lie came easy. They always did. But this one was slightly larger, because it was told to someone looking at him with trust, in the warm dark, after a kiss that had meant something.

"That's sweet," Priya said. "Tell her you're being safe."

"I will."

He put his arm around her. She leaned into him. And somewhere on the third floor, Felix Decker watched the *In* message arrive on his screen and smiled the smile of a man whose machinery was working exactly as designed.
