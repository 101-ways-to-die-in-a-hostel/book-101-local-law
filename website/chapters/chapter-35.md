# Chapter 35: Confession

Connor told Rizal everything.

Not all at once. Not in the ordered, chronological manner of a statement prepared for a courtroom or a letter written to a police sergeant. The telling was organic, disordered, the telling of a man who had been silent for too long and was now unsilent and the unsilencing was not a tap being opened but a dam breaking, the water finding its own channels, flowing where the terrain allowed, accumulating in pools before rushing forward again.

He told Rizal about Felix.

"Felix. His name's Felix Decker. German bloke. Thirty-one, maybe thirty-two. He's at the hostel -- the Lantern, on Petaling Street, third floor, he's got a private room because he's -- he pays for the private room, right? He's been there... eighteen months? Yeah. Eighteen months. And the gloves. He wears these gloves. Leather. I thought it was eczema. He told me eczema and I just -- I just believed him. The gloves are so his fingerprints aren't on the packages. He told me that himself. On the rooftop."

The words came out in a rush, tumbling over each other, the syntax collapsing under the weight of the content, the sentences running together without pause or punctuation because pausing required the breath that Connor couldn't spare and punctuation required the composure that Connor didn't have. The words were the words he should have spoken to Ahmad. The words were the words that Priya had begged him to speak to the embassy. The words were the words that Razak had offered to facilitate, that Tomoko had been waiting to corroborate, that Mama Siti had been watching for. The words had been assembled and ready for weeks, and they were now being spoken, and they were being spoken to the wrong person.

Rizal listened. Rizal's listening was expert -- the listening of a man who understood that the most effective extraction technique was not interrogation but silence, not questions but the absence of questions, the open space that a desperate person rushed to fill. Rizal sat on the steel bench opposite Connor, his back against the concrete wall, his legs crossed at the ankle, his posture relaxed, his expression attentive. He nodded at intervals. He made small sounds of understanding -- "Mm," "Yeah," "Right" -- the acoustic currency of a listener who was engaged but not directing, who was receiving but not steering, who was letting Connor talk because Connor talking was the objective and the objective required no intervention beyond presence.

"He recruited me in the common room," Connor said. "Day 1. My first night. He bought me a beer. He told me travel stories. He was charming -- that's the thing, that's the thing that nobody understands, he was *charming*, he was the most charming person in the building, and the charm was real, it worked, I felt it, I felt chosen, I felt like he'd picked me because I was special, because I was different, because I was the kind of person who deserved a friend like Felix Decker."

He laughed. The laugh was not funny. The laugh was the sound that humans produced when the alternative was the other sound, the sound of breaking, and breaking was not an option yet because there was more to tell and the telling required the structural integrity that breaking would destroy.

"It started with an envelope. Day 6. Just an envelope, sealed, deliver it to a man at a café in Bukit Bintang. Twenty minutes of walking. RM200. I didn't open it. I didn't think about it. The money was good and the task was easy and the person who asked me was my friend and friends asked friends for favours and this was a favour. That's what I told myself. That's what the machine told me."

"The machine?" Rizal said. The question was the first question he'd asked. The question was casual, interested, the question of a man following a story rather than conducting an interrogation.

"In my head. The thing that... rationalises. The thing that takes the evidence and converts it into something manageable. The machine that said the envelopes were business documents and the packages were phone accessories and the backpack was electronics and the charger boxes were chargers. The machine that said *you don't know for certain* every time I almost knew for certain. The machine kept me going. The machine kept me carrying."

He told Rizal about the deliveries. All of them. The envelopes -- three in the first week. The packages -- brown paper, taped, the weight that felt wrong. The contacts: Mr. Tan at the café in Bukit Bintang. Auntie Lim at the shophouse in Jalan Ipoh. Danny at the defunct karaoke bar in Bukit Bintang, Lot 22B. Ah Keat at the nasi kandar restaurant behind Petaling Street.

He told Rizal about the backpack. The red Deuter, six hundred grams to the warehouse in Sentul. The warehouse with the men who weighed packages and sealed them and spoke in Hokkien and didn't look at Connor because looking at the mule was not part of the protocol.

He told Rizal about Wei. The phone repair shop, two doors from the hostel. The back room -- the stainless steel table, the vacuum sealer, the digital scale, the rolls of cling film, the charger boxes that were not charger boxes. Wei's precision. Wei's silence. Wei's function.

He told Rizal about the money. Fourteen thousand ringgit in his bank account. The deposits that couldn't be explained by social media consulting. The money that Priya had seen and questioned and he had deflected.

"Priya," Rizal said. The name registered with the interest of a man who had been listening for names. "Who's Priya?"

"She's... she was at the hostel. British. A medical student. She tried to warn me. She printed the law -- the Dangerous Drugs Act, Section 39B. She put it on my bed. She confronted Felix. She... she's on a plane right now. To London. She has a letter. A letter to the police, to the embassy, to a newspaper. She was going to send it when she landed."

"She's coming back though, yeah? Or she's gone for good?"

Connor calculated. Priya's flight was at eleven thirty last night. A thirteen-hour flight. She would land at Heathrow around five AM London time, which was one PM KL time. It was now -- he looked at the cell, at the absence of a clock, at the fluorescent light that gave no indication of time -- it was now late afternoon, maybe four or five PM. Priya had landed. Priya might have already sent the letter.

"She's already landed," Connor said. "She might have already sent it. To Sergeant Ahmad. Narcotics Division. Here. At this station."

"Ahmad," Rizal said. "You know Ahmad?"

"He gave me his card. At a checkpoint. Bukit Bintang. Weeks ago. He looked at me and said *Malaysia is not a game*. I kept his card. I called him -- twice. The first time I got voicemail. The second time he answered. I couldn't speak. I just... I couldn't."

Rizal nodded. The nodding was slow, thoughtful, the nodding of a man processing information. Behind the nodding, behind the calm exterior, behind the performance of a man listening to a cellmate's story, calculations were being made. The calculations were not Connor's to see. The calculations were the internal process of a man who was tallying names -- Felix Decker, Wei, Mr. Tan, Auntie Lim, Danny, Ah Keat, Priya Sharma, Sergeant Ahmad -- and locations -- the Lantern Hostel, the phone repair shop, the Sentul warehouse, Bukit Bintang, Jalan Ipoh -- and assessments -- a letter in transit, a journalist with photographs, a hostel owner with records, a narcotics officer with a card that connected him to the mule.

The calculations were the network's calculations. The calculations were the risk assessment that the network performed when a mule was caught -- the assessment of what the mule knew, what the mule had said, what the mule might say, and the degree to which the mule's testimony could damage the infrastructure that the network had built over years of operation.

Connor's testimony could damage the infrastructure. Connor's testimony, combined with Priya's letter and Tomoko's photographs and Razak's records and Ahmad's case file, could dismantle the infrastructure. The network's calculation was simple: the mule had to be silenced before the testimony could be delivered.

But Connor didn't know this. Connor was talking because talking was the thing that silence had denied him for forty-seven days, and now silence was over, and the talking was a release, a catharsis, the opening of a valve that had been closed too long. The talking felt good. The talking felt like the thing he should have done on Day 6, on Day 15, on Day 39 when Priya had said *call Ahmad* and he had gone to the rooftop instead. The talking felt like salvation.

The talking was the opposite of salvation. The talking was the mechanism of his destruction.

---

He told Rizal about the suitcase.

"Four hundred and fifty grams. Felix told me. He told me the number. He said it would pass a visual inspection and an X-ray but not a dog. He said Fridays were usually quiet. He said *usually*."

"Usually," Rizal repeated. The word sat between them in the fluorescent light.

"There was a checkpoint. Between Tapah and Ipoh. Two checkpoints, actually. The first one was routine -- three officers, no dog. Waved through. The second one had dogs. Two dogs. German shepherds. The dog went along the luggage compartment and stopped at my suitcase and sat down. The handler said *positif*. And that was it. That was the end."

He paused. The pause was not for effect but for breath, the body's insistence on the mechanical requirement of oxygen even while the mind was operating at a level that made oxygen feel irrelevant.

"They opened the suitcase on the highway shoulder. Cut the lining. Found five vacuum bags. Tested the contents. Blue. Positive for methamphetamine. They arrested me. Read me my rights. Put me in a car. Drove me here."

"To Ahmad's station," Rizal said.

"To Ahmad's station. Yeah. The irony isn't lost on me."

Rizal looked at Connor. Something shifted -- not in his expression, which remained attentive and calm, but in the architecture beneath it, the way a building settles on its foundations when a load is added and the settling is invisible but the structure knows. Rizal uncrossed his legs. The movement was small, unhurried, but the new posture was different from the old posture in a way that Connor did not register: the old posture was the posture of listening, of a body arranged for the purpose of absorbing information, and the new posture was the posture of a body that had absorbed enough and was rearranging itself for the next function. Rizal's hands, which had been resting loosely on his knees, moved to the bench on either side of his thighs, the fingers curling around the steel edge, the grip light but present, the grip of a man who was no longer a listener but something else. His questions, in the last minutes of Connor's telling, had become fractionally more precise -- "Ahmad, you said? Narcotics Division?" and "The letter -- she was sending it to Ahmad specifically?" and "The journalist -- she had photographs of Felix?" -- the questions arriving with the focused economy of a man who was no longer following a story but confirming an inventory, ticking items off a list that existed somewhere behind his calm, attentive eyes. The fluorescent light caught those eyes and for a moment -- less than a moment, a fraction of a second that Connor would never consciously recall -- there was something in them that had not been there before. Not menace. Not cruelty. Certainty. The specific, settled certainty of a professional who had confirmed what he needed to confirm and now knew the shape of what came next.

The look was the look of a man who had heard enough. Not enough as in sufficient for a conversation, but enough as in sufficient for a purpose, the purpose that Rizal's presence in this cell served, the purpose that Connor didn't know and wouldn't know until the purpose was enacted.

"Better you rest, brother. Long day already," Rizal said.

"I can't sleep."

"Try. Lie down. Use your towel as a pillow. The bench is shit but it's better than the floor."

Connor looked at the bench. The steel surface was cold and hard and the bench was designed not for comfort but for containment, the minimum accommodation that the system provided to the bodies it held. He lay down. The bench was short -- his legs hung off the end, his knees bent. He folded the blue towel and placed it under his head. The towel was soft against his scalp. The microfiber compressed to a thin cushion. The towel smelled of sunscreen and the faint, chemical scent of hostel soap and the accumulated olfactory memory of twelve countries.

He closed his eyes. The fluorescent light buzzed behind his eyelids, the light penetrating the thin skin, the darkness not complete but red -- the colour of blood seen from behind the lid, the colour of the world when you closed your eyes in a room that never went dark.

Rizal sat on the opposite bench. Rizal did not close his eyes. Rizal watched Connor with the steady, patient attention of a man waiting for sleep to arrive, the way a hunter waited for prey to settle, the patience that was not idleness but preparation, the stillness that preceded action.

The cell was quiet. The fluorescent light buzzed. The disinfectant smell was constant -- the chemical signature of a space that was cleaned with industrial products by people who cleaned without care, the cleaning a function rather than an act, the function maintaining the minimum standard of hygiene that the system required.

---

Connor didn't sleep. He drifted -- the shallow, incomplete drift that existed between wakefulness and sleep, the state in which the mind produced fragments rather than dreams, the fragments assembling and disassembling with the random, kaleidoscopic logic of a consciousness that was too exhausted to organise itself but too afraid to surrender.

The fragments were memories.

His mother's kitchen. The yellow curtains. The Vegemite jar with the red lid. The morning light coming through the window above the sink, the light that fell on the counter in a rectangle that moved as the sun moved, the slow clock of domestic life.

His father's hand on his shoulder at the airport. "The rules don't care who you are." The hand heavy and warm and the weight of it carrying the authority of a man who knew something about the world that his son didn't know and was trying to communicate it through a palm and five fingers and the pressure of a grip that said *please listen*.

Priya's face at the hawker stall. The first time. Her glasses reflecting the stall's fluorescent light (the light -- always the light, the fluorescent light in every memory now, the light contaminating the past the way the drugs had contaminated his luggage). Her expression: amused, sharp, the face of a woman encountering a specimen she found irritating and interesting in equal measure.

Felix in the common room. The beer. The stories. The scar on the eyebrow. The linen shirt. The charm that was a weapon. The smile that was a tool. The word *reliable*. "I could use someone reliable around here." The word that had opened the door, the first door, the door that led to all the other doors.

The fragments cycled. The kitchen. The airport. The hawker stall. The common room. The envelope. The package. The backpack. The charger box. The suitcase. The dog. The handcuffs. The cell. The light.

The light.

Always the light. The fluorescent tube on the ceiling of the cell, the tube that buzzed and hummed and cast its flat, blue-white illumination on everything -- the walls, the bench, the toilet, the towel, the two men, the air. The light was the cell's defining feature. The light was the thing that made the cell different from every other space Connor had occupied -- not the bars, which were expected, not the concrete, which was expected, but the light, which was unexpected in its permanence, in its refusal to turn off, in the message that its permanence conveyed: *there is no night here, there is no rest, there is no darkness to hide in, there is only this -- this light, this buzzing, this brightness that reveals everything and conceals nothing*.

He opened his eyes. The light was there. The light was always there.

Rizal was watching him. Rizal's eyes were open, steady, the eyes reflecting the fluorescent light in two small points, the eyes of a man who had not slept and did not intend to.

"What time is it?" Connor said.

"Late. Maybe ten. Maybe eleven."

"How do you know?"

"The shift change. The guards. You hear the doors. The evening shift ends at ten. The night shift starts."

Connor listened. The sounds of the station were distant but present -- the muffled rhythm of a building that operated on a schedule, the opening and closing of doors, the footsteps in corridors, the occasional voice. The sounds were the sounds of a system running, the bureaucratic machinery of a police station performing its nightly transition from day operations to night operations, the change of personnel, the change of rhythm, the change from the brisk efficiency of daylight hours to the slower, quieter tempo of the night.

A sound at the cell door -- metal on metal, the scrape of the observation slot sliding open. A rectangle of light appeared in the door at eye level, the light from the corridor brighter than the cell's fluorescent tube, sharp-edged and briefly blinding. A face filled the rectangle: a guard, new, not the one who had processed Connor. The night-shift officer. His face was the face of a man four hours into a shift that would last until six AM -- the eyes carrying the particular fatigue of institutional boredom, the mouth set in the neutral expression of a person performing a task he had performed a thousand times, the check a function rather than an investigation, the eyes moving without searching, seeing without analysing. The guard's gaze swept the cell -- two prisoners, one lying down, one sitting -- and found nothing that required action, and the observation slot scraped shut, and the rectangle of corridor light vanished, and the cell was again sealed in its own fluorescent universe.

On the opposite bench, Rizal's eyes tracked the slot as it closed. The tracking was brief -- a flick of attention -- but in the moment after the slot shut, Rizal's right hand moved. The movement was nearly invisible: his index finger extended from the loose fist resting on his thigh and tapped once, softly, against the steel bench. A single tap. The tap of a man marking a timestamp. Then the finger curled back into the fist and the hand was still and the movement was over and it had meant nothing, or it had meant everything, and the difference between nothing and everything was a difference that Connor, lying with his eyes half-closed, could not perceive.

Footsteps. Receding. A door, distant, opening and closing. Then the corridor was silent, the guard absorbed into the station's nighttime architecture, gone.

"Night shift," Rizal said. "One guard for the whole block. Checks every hour. Maybe every forty minutes if he's keen. Maybe every ninety if he's not."

"How do you know?"

"You hear the pattern. First check is always prompt -- the new shift, the fresh guard, the supervisor maybe still around. After that it loosens. The gaps get wider. By two, three AM..." He made a gesture with his hand, an opening, a spreading, the gesture of a man describing the natural expansion of unsupervised time. "The station is quiet. The guard has a desk somewhere. A phone. Earbuds. Maybe a game, maybe a show. Six hours of checking cells and paperwork and the boredom that is the specific boredom of a man who is employed to watch other men sit in rooms. The boredom wins. It always wins."

The information was delivered casually, conversationally, with the warm tone of a man sharing institutional wisdom with a newcomer -- *this is how it works, this is what to expect, this is how the night will go*. The information was comforting. But the information was also reconnaissance -- Rizal was narrating the security environment, mapping the intervals between checks, calculating the window of unobserved time that would open in the hours ahead, the way a professional assessed a space before operating in it. Every detail -- the guard's routine, the loosening intervals, the desk and the earbuds and the boredom -- was a variable in an equation that Connor could not see, an equation whose solution was a span of uninterrupted minutes sometime between two and four AM, a span long enough for the task that Rizal's presence in this cell had been arranged to accomplish.

Connor didn't hear the reconnaissance. Connor heard a man who knew about police stations, who understood the system, who could help navigate the long, terrifying night ahead.

"I need to talk to someone," Connor said. He sat up on the bench. "Ahmad. Sergeant Ahmad. Narcotics Division. He's in this building -- this building, this station, Dang Wangi. He gave me his card. He looked at me at a checkpoint and he knew, he *knew*, he could see it, and he said *Malaysia is not a game* and he gave me his card because he was giving me a chance, and I didn't take it, and I need to take it now. If I can talk to him--"

He was rehearsing it already, the speech assembling itself in his mouth, the words that Priya had helped him research in those desperate final days at the hostel -- the legal terminology she had found on the Malaysian Bar Council website, the phrases she had underlined in her precise handwriting on the printout she'd left on his bed. *I am a cooperating witness. I wish to make a voluntary statement under Section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Code. I have information regarding a drug trafficking network operating in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. I can identify the handler, the supplier, the distribution contacts, and the locations of operation. I am requesting consideration under Section 39C, which provides for reduced sentencing in exchange for cooperation with the prosecution.* The words were legal, formal, the words of a system that Connor had spent his entire adult life refusing to engage with, the words that were now, in this cell, under this light, the only words that might save his life. He had memorised them, refined the delivery during the hours on the bench, imagining Ahmad's face as he listened -- the stern, professional face softening into the expression of an officer who recognised that the boy in front of him was not a trafficker but a fool, a useful fool who could bring down something larger, and the recognition would be the beginning of the process that would transform Connor from a prisoner into a witness, from a dead man into a living one.

The hope was enormous. The hope filled every cubic centimetre of the fluorescent air and the hope was built on the belief that Ahmad -- the man who had stood on a Bukit Bintang pavement and looked at Connor with the eyes of someone who had seen a hundred Connors -- would listen, would intercede, would reach into the machinery of the Dangerous Drugs Act and pull Connor out before the machinery did what machinery did. The hope was desperate and irrational and it was all Connor had, and he held it the way a drowning man held a plank, with the full, white-knuckled grip of a body that understood the alternative to holding was sinking.

"In the morning," Rizal said.

The words were gentle. But beneath the gentleness there was something else -- something in the fractional pause between "the" and "morning," a pause so small that only a machine calibrated for such measurements could have detected it: the pause fractionally longer than the words required, as though "in the morning" were not a promise but a sedative, a verbal anaesthetic administered to keep the patient still and cooperative in the hours remaining.

"Tonight nobody is coming, lah. Morning, they come," Rizal continued.

The morning. Everything was the morning. The embassy was the morning. The lawyer was the morning. Ahmad was the morning. The morning was the boundary between the night and the process, between the cell and the system's official response, between the waiting and the acting. The morning was twelve hours away. The morning was the thing that Connor had to survive to reach.

He pulled the blue towel tighter around his shoulders. The towel was warm now -- warmed by his body, the microfiber absorbing his heat and reflecting it back, the thermal loop of a body trying to comfort itself with its own warmth. The towel was the only soft thing in the cell. The bench was steel. The walls were concrete. The bars were iron. The towel was the exception -- the one material that yielded, that gave, that pressed against his skin with the quality of something that was not trying to contain him.

He thought about the morning. The guard would come at six, or seven. The day shift would begin. Connor would stand at the bars and say the words -- *I am a cooperating witness, I wish to make a voluntary statement* -- and the words would travel through the system the way signals travelled through wires, from the guard to the desk officer to Ahmad, and Ahmad would come, and Ahmad would listen, and the listening would be the beginning of something that was not this cell, this light, this night.

The words were ready. The words had been ready for weeks. The words would be spoken in the morning. The morning was the thing he had to reach.

He closed his eyes again. The light persisted behind his eyelids. The light was permanent. The light was the condition of the cell, the condition of the night, the condition of the last night of Connor Briggs's life, though he didn't know that yet, though the not-knowing was the last mercy the universe would extend.

Rizal sat across from him. Rizal's eyes were open. Rizal was watching. Rizal was waiting.

The fluorescent light buzzed. The cell was quiet. The station was quiet. And somewhere outside, somewhere in the city, the late call to prayer rose from a mosque and reached through concrete and distance and the acoustic barriers of institutional architecture and arrived in the cell as a faint, ghostly thread of sound, the muezzin's voice carrying the words that had been spoken five times a day for fourteen centuries, the words that called the faithful to prayer, the words that Connor heard without understanding, without responding, without knowing that the words were the last beautiful thing he would hear.

The night continued. The light buzzed. The towel was warm.

And the man across the cell sat with his eyes open and his hands on the bench edge and his body still.
