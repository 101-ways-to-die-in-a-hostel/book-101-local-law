# Chapter 9: The Map of the Dead

The door was behind reception, and Connor had walked past it every day for eleven days without seeing it.

This was not difficult. The door was the same colour as the wall -- a mottled cream that had once been white, softened by decades of tropical damp into something organic, something that looked less like paint and more like skin. There was no sign on it, no handle visible from the common room side, just a thin vertical line where the door met the frame, hairline-thin, barely distinguishable from the cracks that ran through the plaster like the building's own nervous system. If you didn't know it was there, it was a wall. If you did know, it was a door. This was the kind of detail that said something about Uncle Razak, though Connor would never work out exactly what.

It was mid-morning on Day 11, and Connor was in the common room eating Mama Siti's nasi lemak with the reverent focus of a man who had discovered religion through coconut rice. His phone was propped against a water bottle, filming the plate at an angle that made the banana leaf look like an artifact from an undiscovered civilisation. He was composing the caption in his head -- *When the hostel aunty's cooking is so good you consider permanent residency* -- when Uncle Razak appeared.

"Appeared" was the right word. Razak had a way of being in a room that bypassed the conventional mechanics of arrival. One moment the common room contained Connor, his nasi lemak, and the background furniture of hostel life -- the bookshelf, the jigsaw puzzle, the TV showing a cooking competition in Mandarin. The next moment there was also a man of approximately sixty-three years standing beside the reception desk, as though the building had generated him from its own substance.

Uncle Razak bin Omar was a large man made small by posture -- broad-shouldered, barrel-chested, his thick scarred hands hanging at his sides like tools he no longer quite needed. His face was round and deeply creased, the skin darkened to mahogany by six decades of equatorial sun, and when he smiled the creases deepened into something that looked genuinely warm. He wore a batik shirt in blues and browns, loose cotton trousers, and plastic sandals. Reading glasses hung from a cord around his neck.

"Connor!" He said everyone's name like that -- with the exclamation mark audible. "Come, come. You have finished eating? I want to show you something interesting."

He reached behind the reception counter, found a point on the wall that looked like wall, and pushed. The door opened inward on silent hinges, revealing a narrow corridor lit by a single bulb, and beyond it, a room. "My office."

Connor followed. The corridor was barely two metres long, the air different here -- cooler, drier, carrying the particular smell of newsprint ageing in a humid climate. Not quite mould, not quite dust. The olfactory equivalent of sepia.

Razak's office was small. A wooden desk scarred by decades of use, piled with papers and ledgers and a laptop so old it might have been the communal Dell's grandfather. A leather chair, cracked, the stuffing leaking from one arm. A reading lamp with a green glass shade casting amber across the desk. A shelf of books lined up with a collector's neatness: *The Backpacker Murders*, *Death Abroad*, *Hostel: The True Stories*, *Missing Persons of Southeast Asia*. All true crime.

But it was the walls that stopped him.

Every surface that wasn't shelf or door was covered. Newspaper clippings, dozens of them, pinned directly to the plaster in overlapping layers -- some yellowed to the colour of old teeth, some recent enough that the ink was still sharp. Different languages: English, Malay, Thai, German, French, Indonesian. Headlines visible even in the low light:

*FIRE IN BUDAPEST HOSTEL KILLS 4 -- FAULTY WIRING BLAMED*

*BACKPACKER DIES IN BARCELONA BALCONY FALL -- RAILING FOUND DEFECTIVE*

*METHANOL POISONING IN VANG VIENG: 5 TOURISTS HOSPITALISED, 3 DEAD*

*CAPE TOWN BACKPACKERS' MURDER: SUSPECT ARRESTED*

Some clippings had handwritten notes in the margins -- dates, names, annotations in Razak's cramped script. Some were circled in red pen. Some had single words: *avoidable*, *covered up*, *no investigation*.

And on the wall behind the desk, dominating the room the way the Petronas Towers dominated the skyline: a map.

Large -- at least a metre wide -- a standard Mercator projection stuck with red pins, small and round-headed. Connor's eyes moved across the continents: three pins in Western Europe, two in Eastern, five across South America, one in Australia, two in Africa. And Southeast Asia -- Southeast Asia was a constellation. The pins there were so dense they overlapped, a cluster of red dots marking Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Thirty pins in that region alone. Maybe forty. Each pin had a small paper tag dangling from it by thread: a name, a year, a cause.

*Bangkok 2014 -- CO. Quito 2017 -- Fall. Phnom Penh 2019 -- Methanol. Siem Reap 2016 -- Drowning. Pai 2012 -- Motorbike.*

Connor stood in the doorway and stared. The map covered the entire wall. The red pins were like a disease, spreading outward from a central mass in Southeast Asia, thinning at the edges of the world but never disappearing entirely. There were pins in Alaska. There were pins in New Zealand. Wherever people slept in shared rooms in foreign countries, the red pins followed.

"Sit, sit," Razak said, squeezing past to his desk. He lowered himself into the leather chair with the deliberate care of a man whose knees had opinions. "I'll make tea."

From a shelf hidden behind papers, he produced two metal cups and a warm kettle and performed a trick Connor had seen in hawker stalls but never in an office. He raised one cup above his head and poured the tea in a long, arcing stream into the cup held at waist height -- the liquid falling in a smooth amber rope, foaming as it hit the surface. He switched hands, pouring back, the stream longer this time, a full arm's length of liquid suspended in air, catching the desk lamp's light like a thread of gold. Back and forth, three times, four, the foam building on the surface.

"Teh tarik," Razak said, setting a cup in front of Connor. "Pulled tea. The secret is the height. The higher you pour, the better the foam." He smiled. "In the old days, the tea stall operators on Petaling Street would compete to see who could pull the highest. Two metres, three metres. The champion was a man named Ah Beng who could pour from a stepladder and not spill a drop. He's dead now. Heart attack. But the tea lives on."

The teh tarik was sweet, milky, rich -- condensed milk and strong black tea, the foam on top thick enough to leave a moustache.

"This," Razak said, nodding at the walls, "is my collection."

He sipped. He let the word settle.

"Fifteen years ago, a boy died in a hostel in Chiang Mai. Carbon monoxide from a faulty water heater. He went to sleep in the shower and never woke up." Razak pointed to a pin in northern Thailand. "The hostel covered it up. Filed it as a heart attack. The family never knew the truth. Nobody else records them, Connor. The hostels cover them up. The police file them away. But I remember."

His finger moved across the map. "Bangkok, 2014. Three dead -- carbon monoxide, faulty heater. A whole dorm. An American, a Briton, a Canadian. The hostel changed its name and reopened three months later." Another pin. "Quito, 2017 -- a girl, Swedish, twenty-two. Fell from a fourth-floor balcony. The railing had been loose for months. Guests had complained." Another. "Phnom Penh, 2019 -- methanol in the rice wine. Five backpackers poisoned, two survived. The bar closed. Another opened in the same location six weeks later, different name."

Connor leaned forward, both hands around the teh tarik, eyes moving between Razak's face and the map. He was fascinated. Not with the weight of it, not with the accumulation of preventable death. Connor was fascinated the way he was fascinated by anything with narrative potential. He was seeing content. He was seeing posts. He was seeing a thread, a series, a story that his 4,200 followers would find darkly compelling.

"Uncle," he said, "this is sick."

Razak looked at him.

"Like, in a good way. How many pins are on there?"

"Sixty-seven. That I know of. The real number is higher. Hotels keep records. Hostels keep secrets."

"Can I photograph the map?"

He was already reaching for his phone, already framing the shot -- the red pins catching the desk lamp's light, the handwritten tags like tiny epitaphs. He'd caption it: *The death map. Uncle Razak at The Lantern Hostel has been tracking backpacker deaths for 15 years. Every red pin is someone who didn't come home.* The hashtags wrote themselves.

Razak hesitated. Then he waved his hand. "Sure, sure."

Connor took six photos from different angles. Close-ups of the Southeast Asian pins. A wide shot of the whole map. Detail shots of the tags.

"You should start a podcast, Uncle. Seriously. 'Deaths in Hostels.' True crime is massive right now. You'd get a huge following."

Razak sat behind his desk, watching Connor photograph the dead the way you'd photograph street art. "These are real people, Connor."

"No, yeah, totally. That's what makes it so powerful. Every pin is a story. You could do an episode per death. That's a Netflix series right there."

Razak looked at him for a long time. The expression on his face was difficult to categorise -- something between pity and disgust, with recognition underneath. He'd seen this type before. The bright, confident young traveler who walks through the world seeing everything as raw material, every human experience as something to be captured and captioned and posted for strangers who will scroll past it in three seconds.

He offered more tea. He changed the subject.

---

"The building has been many things," Razak said, refilling Connor's cup with the theatrical pour.

"Built in 1928. A Hokkien textile warehouse. Then the Japanese came." The word settled in the room the way a heavy stone settles in water. "1942 to 1945. This building was used as an administrative office. That's the official record." He paused. "Unofficially, people went in and did not come out. The old neighbours call it *rumah tangisan*. The house of crying. You've seen the Japanese characters on the second-floor landing? Under the paint?"

Connor had. He'd walked past them every day without thinking about what they said.

"After the war, the Lim family reclaimed the building, but they didn't live here. Nobody wanted to live here. They rented the ground floor to a businessman who ran a gambling den through the fifties and sixties. Mahjong, mostly. Illegal, of course, but this was Chinatown in the old days -- the police came for tea and left with their pockets full." He chuckled, but the chuckle was thin. "Then a brothel in the seventies. Women from Indonesia, the Philippines, some local." He touched the desk. "This was the madam's room. The blue tiles in the hallway -- she chose those. After the brothel closed, the building sat empty for twenty years. When I renovated, we found things in the walls. Japanese military buttons. Old mahjong tiles. A woman's shoe." He tapped the desk. "Every use leaves something behind. The building doesn't forget."

Connor's phone was in his hand, filming. "That's content gold, Uncle. Seriously. You could do ghost tours. 'The Haunted Hostel of Petaling Street.' Charge fifty ringgit a head."

Something moved in Razak's expression -- something tired and faintly nauseated. The expression of a man watching someone use a gravestone as a selfie stick.

"The building has seen enough commerce. It doesn't need to sell its dead."

He poured more tea. Changed the subject with the practised redirection of a man who had been a host for seventeen years. Then he set down his cup and said, very quietly:

"Be careful who you trust in this city, Connor. Not everyone who smiles at you is your friend."

The words sat between them. The desk lamp flickered -- a momentary brownout in the old wiring -- and the newspaper clippings on the walls seemed to shift.

Connor smiled. "You're alright, Uncle. Everyone here is awesome."

Razak watched him go. He didn't finish his tea. He didn't stand. He sat behind his desk in the amber light, in his small room papered with the dead, and looked at the map. His eyes found a pin in Kuala Lumpur -- one among many, unremarkable, positioned right where they were sitting. The tag read: *KL 2025 -- Custody.* A girl. Swedish. Twenty-two. The name he never said aloud. Lena. The name that was also scratched into the wooden frame of Bed 7, where Connor slept every night without seeing it.

Razak had known about the trafficking network for years. He had known about Felix -- not this Felix specifically, but the Felixes, the succession of charming Europeans who passed through Chinatown with too much cash and too little luggage, who befriended the lonely and the broke. He had made his arrangement: they don't recruit from his hostel, he doesn't call the police. The arrangement had protected him. It had protected his guests. It had worked, in the way that all bargains with the dark work -- as long as nobody looked at it too closely.

Felix had broken the arrangement. Felix had recruited Connor from inside the hostel, from the common room, from under the red lanterns that Razak had hung with his own hands. And Razak had told Connor to be careful, and Connor had smiled, and the arrangement was broken and there was nothing left to do but sit in the amber light and know what was coming and not stop it.

He reached for his tea. It was cold.

The Petaling Street night market was a different creature after dark.

The harsh daytime fluorescents were supplemented by strings of LED lights -- white, blue, orange -- that turned the canopy into a low-slung galaxy. Food stalls dominated: charcoal smoke rose through the lights like fog, carrying the smell of satay and char kway teow and the caramelised edges of frying popiah. Chinese opera music drifted from a tinny speaker, the falsetto wail rising and falling over the crowd noise like a bird circling above a forest.

Connor walked through it with Priya on his left and Jake on his right, and for a suspended half-hour, nothing else existed. The press of the crowd was warm and chaotic -- tourists with cameras, locals with shopping bags, children darting between legs. The calls of vendors layered over each other in Cantonese and Mandarin and English: "Hey, you want bag? Good price!" "Best watch, real leather!" "Makan, makan, come eat!" The air was thick with charcoal smoke and frying oil and the sugary tang of shaved ice being drizzled with syrup at a dessert stall.

He was generous with his money -- Felix's money. The RM700 from three deliveries sat in his account like a small promotion, lifting him from anxiety to ease. Two envelopes and a package, delivered without incident, without a single question about what he was carrying or for whom. The money changed who he was. It made him the person he wanted to be: the one with his hand in his pocket, the one who said "I've got this."

At the clothing stalls, he pulled a fake Supreme t-shirt from a rack -- white, with the familiar red box logo across the chest. The lettering was slightly too thick and the tag said SUPPREME if you looked closely, which no one would.

"How much?"

"Thirty."

"Twenty-five."

The vendor, a young woman scrolling her phone, didn't look up. "Fine."

Connor dropped the money on the counter. "There you go, mate. Early Christmas present."

Jake held the shirt up against his sunburned chest. "Dude. You didn't have to do that."

"I know. I'm a legend. Put it on."

Jake pulled his old shirt off right there in the market and pulled on the fake Supreme, and several vendors watched this display with the practised indifference of people who had seen far stranger things on Petaling Street.

At a jade stall near the temple end, Connor stopped. Small table, green velvet, trays of jade jewelry in shades from nearly black to the pale translucent colour of new leaves. He pointed at a bracelet -- thin, delicate, deep forest green.

"How much?"

The vendor held up three fingers.

"Try it on," he told Priya.

"Connor, no--"

"Just try it."

She picked it up. The jade was cool against her dark skin, vivid green against brown. She turned her hand, watching the light move across the stone's surface. The bracelet was slightly too large, sliding toward her knuckles, and she pushed it back -- a small, unconscious gesture, the gesture of a woman who has already imagined owning this thing.

"Done." Connor handed the vendor fifty ringgit. "Keep the change."

"You don't need to buy me things," Priya said, in the tone of someone simultaneously touched and annoyed.

"I know. I want to."

She looked at the bracelet on her wrist. She pushed her glasses up -- the diagnostic gesture. Then: "Thank you." Her voice was different. Simpler. The irony stripped away.

The bracelet cost thirty ringgit -- about ten Australian dollars. A sum that had come from an envelope delivered to a man in Bukit Bintang whose name Connor didn't know, on behalf of a German whose business Connor didn't question. The jade sat on Priya's wrist like a small, green promise, and it was beautiful, and it was paid for with money that was not clean, and neither of them knew this.

They ate satay. A vendor at the market's edge was working a charcoal grill, the coals glowing orange-red, plumes of smoke spiralling into the LED lights above. Thirty sticks of marinated chicken, peanut sauce thick enough to stand a skewer in, compressed rice cake, cucumber wedges. They stood at the counter and ate with their hands and didn't speak because speaking would have been an interruption. They drank fresh coconut water from green coconuts hacked open with machetes -- the juice cool and faintly sweet, cutting through the richness of the satay.

Then Jake announced he needed a watch.

At the stall, he pointed at a gold Rolex Submariner.

"Eighty ringgit," the vendor said.

Jake straightened up, his face set in borrowed seriousness. "I watched a TED Talk about negotiation. You say eighty, I say twenty, we meet in the middle." He paused. "So. I'll give you a hundred."

The vendor blinked. Looked at Connor. Connor shook his head. The vendor looked back at Jake.

"One hundred ringgit," he said. "For a watch I was selling for eighty. Deal."

He took the note with the delicate speed of a man pocketing a miracle.

Priya laughed. Not the measured, ironic half-laugh she deployed for Connor's jokes, but a real laugh -- full and sudden and surprised out of her, her head tipping back, her hand going to her mouth, her glasses sliding down her nose. Jake started laughing because Priya was laughing, and Connor started laughing because the night was warm and the market was beautiful and Priya's laugh was the best sound he'd heard in twelve countries.

For a moment -- brief, specific, unrepeatable -- everything was perfect. The three of them stood under a canopy of LED lights and charcoal smoke, laughing about a fake watch, and the Guan Di Temple glowed red and gold at the end of the market with incense smoke rising from its open doors, and somewhere a speaker played Chinese opera in a high, wavering voice that sounded like it was singing about something that had happened a long time ago and would happen again.

Connor reached for Priya's hand. She let him take it. Her fingers were cool from the coconut water, and the jade bracelet slid against his wrist as their hands interlocked. She was watching Jake try to take a selfie with his new watch -- an operation requiring both hands, which Jake was solving by holding the phone in his teeth. She was smiling. Not the diagnostic smile. Just smiling.

Connor held her hand and felt, with a clarity that surprised him, happy. Not content. Not performing happiness for an audience. Just happy, the way a glass is full, the way a room is warm.

He would think about this moment later. In a room without windows, under a light that never turned off, he would close his eyes and try to find his way back to this market, this smoke, this hand in his hand. He would try, and he would almost succeed, and then the door would open and the trying would stop.

But that was later. Now the night was young, and Priya's hand was in his, and the red and gold glow of the temple lit the smoke above the market like something sacred.

---

They walked home through the darkening streets after eleven.

The night market was contracting -- a galaxy collapsing back into ordinary matter. Metal shutters rolled down with bangs and clatters that echoed off the shophouse facades. Vendors packed fake designer goods into cardboard boxes with the practised speed of people who did this every night. The food stalls were the last to close, their grills still smoking, their fluorescent tubes still buzzing, a few last customers eating standing up with the hurried focus of people aware that the night was ending. The LED light strings went dark section by section, and the market's galaxy collapsed back into a corridor of shuttered stalls and swept pavement and the lingering smell of charcoal and peanut oil.

Jake walked ahead, filming a TikTok of himself in slow motion with his fake Rolex extended toward the camera, his narration audible from ten metres away: "When you're balling on a budget in KL. Link in bio for discount designer watches. Not sponsored but should be."

Connor and Priya walked behind, still holding hands. The street was quieter now, reduced to its nighttime essentials: a motorcycle parked at an angle, its engine ticking as it cooled; a cat picking through a rubbish bag; the distant bass of a club on Changkat, felt more than heard.

They turned the corner onto the hostel's street. The Guan Di Temple was closed, its red doors shut, but incense still leaked from the gaps, sweet and lingering. The traditional Chinese medicine store was dark, its jars of dried things invisible behind the glass. And next to it, Wei's phone repair shop.

The light was on.

The fluorescent tube cast a flat, blue-white light onto the pavement -- the kind of light that made everything it touched look slightly ill. Through the cluttered window display -- cracked screens, coiled USB cables, a handwritten sign reading REPAIR CHEAP FAST -- two figures were standing at the counter inside. One was Wei, the quiet Chinese-Malaysian man in his forties Connor had seen every day, always bent over a phone with a magnifying glass. The other was Felix.

Connor stopped walking. Felix was leaning forward, hands flat on the counter. Wei was opposite, also leaning forward. Between them, on the surface, something Connor couldn't quite make out through the glass -- a shape. It could have been a phone. It could have been a box. Their body language was not customer and shopkeeper. It was the tense, focused intensity of a negotiation, or a briefing -- two men discussing something that mattered.

Connor raised his hand and waved.

Felix looked up.

For one second -- too brief for analysis, too long for comfort -- Felix's face was not the face Connor knew. The warm smile was absent. The easy charm was absent. What remained was something Connor had never seen on Felix's features: flat, still, and cold. Not angry. Not surprised. Just empty. The way a shop window is empty after closing, the displays removed, the lights still on but illuminating nothing.

Then the second passed. Felix raised a hand -- not a wave, a half-gesture, an acknowledgement -- and his mouth moved in something that stopped short of a smile. He turned back to Wei. He did not come to the door. He did not call out. He did not do any of the things Felix always did when he saw Connor.

Connor's hand was still raised. He lowered it.

"What's Felix doing in there?" Jake asked, appearing beside them.

"Probably getting his phone fixed. His screen's been cracked for weeks."

Felix's phone screen was not cracked. Connor had seen him using it that morning, the screen perfectly intact. He knew this, and he said the other thing, and the lie came out smooth and easy, because lying about something you don't want to think about isn't lying -- it's management. The management of a reality you haven't decided to examine yet.

Priya said nothing. She'd looked at the phone shop when Connor stopped. She'd looked at Felix through the glass, at the counter between them, at the posture of two men who were not discussing phone repairs. She'd looked at Connor's face when Felix didn't wave back -- the brief confusion, the quick smoothing-over, the lie that came too easily. She saw something, or the beginning of something, or the shadow of something that hadn't fully formed. But she didn't say it. She held Connor's hand, and she walked, and the jade bracelet was cool on her wrist.

---

Bed 7 in Dorm 3 at midnight was a coffin of foam and vinyl and the breathing of strangers.

Connor lay on his back, staring at the underside of the bunk above him -- the stickers, the carved graffiti, the ghost of a Che Guevara someone had tried to scrape off. The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.* Through the air well, a motorcycle in the distance. Then silence. Then a cat. Then silence again.

He thought about the night market. Priya's hand in his, warm and then cool. Her laugh -- real, unguarded, the kind of laugh that breaks out of a person rather than being performed by one. The jade bracelet, green against brown, sliding on her wrist. Jake's face, guileless and happy, strapping on his overpaid watch with the satisfaction of a man who believed he'd won.

He thought about Uncle Razak's map. Sixty-seven red pins. He could still see the Southeast Asian constellation, thick as a rash. He thought about the pin in Kuala Lumpur -- Razak tapping it with his thick finger, saying quietly: "This one is nearby. A girl. Swedish. Last year." He hadn't elaborated. Connor hadn't asked. The Swedish girl. The pin. The cause of death -- *Custody* -- a word he hadn't thought about, hadn't connected to anything, hadn't allowed to mean what it meant.

He thought about Felix.

The thought arrived clearly, like a bubble rising from deep water. It broke the surface of his mind and sat there, perfectly formed: *What if Felix isn't what he says he is?*

He examined it. He turned it over. He held it up to the light.

Then he popped it.

*Felix is a legend. Felix is my mate. Felix gave me RM700 for basically nothing. That's not sketchy, that's generous.* Felix paying cash for everything? He's European; Europeans use cash. Felix's private room for two months? He values his space. Felix's too-good stories? He's been travelling for years. Felix's cold expression through the phone shop glass? Connor caught him off-guard. Everyone looks weird when they're caught off-guard.

*It means nothing. It all means nothing.*

The rationalisation was smooth and fast and complete, a machine of self-deception so well-oiled it ran without friction. Each doubt was met by a counter-doubt. Each shadow was chased by a spotlight. The machine hummed, and the doubt dissolved, and Connor was left with the warm residue of certainty.

He turned over. The mattress squeaked under him. He thought about Priya's hand because that was warm and good, and the other thing -- the thought about Felix, the cold expression, the phone shop at eleven PM -- was cold and uncertain and would, if he let it grow, threaten everything warm and good.

So he didn't let it grow. He did what he always did with uncomfortable information. He changed the channel. He swiped left on the truth and right on the story he preferred, and the algorithm of his own mind delivered exactly what he wanted: reassurance, comfort, the conviction that everything was fine.

Everything was fine. Everything was absolutely fine.

He closed his eyes. Sleep came slowly, then all at once. He didn't dream. The building dreamed for him -- its old wood creaking, its pipes humming, its ghosts walking corridors that had been corridors for a century, past the Japanese characters on the second-floor landing, past the blue tiles the brothel madam had chosen, past the hidden door to Razak's office where sixty-seven red pins marked sixty-seven stories that had ended badly.

At seven-fifteen the next morning, his phone buzzed on the mattress beside his head. He reached for it with his eyes still closed.

A text from Felix.

*Big day tomorrow. Come find me.*

Connor read it. He smiled. He put the phone down. He rolled over.

Outside, the call to prayer rose from Masjid Jamek, long and wavering, reaching for something above the rooftops and the wires and the heat. It washed over the building and asked the same question it asked every morning, five times a day, a question that had been asked in this city for centuries:

*Are you awake? Are you listening? Do you know where you are?*

Connor was not listening. He was already asleep again, dreaming of night markets and jade bracelets and the faces of people who smiled at him, and not one of those faces, not one, belonged to the man who was going to get him killed.
