# Chapter 17: Easy Money

Days 25 through 30 passed the way water passes over a stone -- continuously, invisibly, wearing everything smooth.

---

**Day 25. Monday. Jalan Ipoh.**

Package: sports bag, black nylon, 3.2 kilograms. Pickup from Felix's room, 9:00 AM. Delivery to Mr. Tan, 9:47 AM. Mr. Tan took the bag, inspected the contents behind a partially closed roller door, nodded. RM350. Grab home. Total time: one hour twelve minutes.

Connor spent the afternoon at Grind Culture. Flat white, RM14. Scheduled three posts for Pacific Soul Retreats. Received a DM from a boutique resort in Lombok asking about social media management: 500K IDR per month, which was approximately RM150, which was less than one delivery. He replied with his rate card -- the one he'd made in Canva six months ago that listed his services at prices no one had ever paid -- and never heard back.

Bank balance: RM11,830.

He bought Priya dinner at a Korean restaurant in Bukit Bintang. Spicy tofu stew, fried chicken, three side dishes. She ate quietly. The conversation was careful -- they talked about her medical studies, about the neurology rotation she was dreading, about the difference between the NHS and the Malaysian health system. They did not talk about packages or photographs or the law. The not-talking was a new feature of their relationship, a room they'd built together and agreed not to enter, and the room grew larger every day.

---

**Day 26. Tuesday. Brickfields.**

Package: brown paper, taped shut, 1.8 kilograms. Lighter than usual. The lightness produced a brief, irrational relief -- as though the weight of the package correlated with the weight of the crime, as though carrying something light was less illegal than carrying something heavy. This was not how the law worked. The law did not care about kilograms. The law cared about grams -- fifty of them -- and the law did not weigh the package. The law weighed the contents.

Connor delivered to the Blue Door. The woman in the green salwar kameez took the package, closed the door, and the door's colour -- that faded, institutional blue -- stayed in his mind for the rest of the day, the way certain colours stay after you close your eyes, an afterimage that was not visual but emotional.

Afternoon: he walked through Brickfields back to the hostel instead of taking a Grab. Little India unfolded around him -- the garland shops and textile stores and the banana leaf restaurants where lunch was served on actual banana leaves, the rice and curries arranged in a pattern that was both aesthetic and practical, the leaf's natural coating preventing the food from sticking, the eating done with the right hand, the leaf folded toward you when you were done to signal satisfaction.

He stopped at a temple. Sri Mahamariamman, the oldest Hindu temple in KL, its tower rising from the street in a riot of painted gods and goddesses, each figure expressing an emotion Connor couldn't name, each colour -- red, green, gold, blue, purple -- saturated beyond reality into the territory of the divine. He stood at the entrance and looked up and felt, for a moment, the specific smallness that comes from standing before something that was ancient when your country was not yet a country. The temple had been here since 1873. It would be here long after Connor was gone.

He photographed it. He captioned it: *When the universe is bigger than your plans.* Twelve hashtags. Thirty-one likes.

Bank balance: RM12,180.

---

**Day 27. Wednesday. Rest day.**

He slept until eleven. Ate Mama Siti's nasi lemak. Sat on the rooftop in the morning heat and did nothing.

The doing-nothing was different now. Previously, Connor's rest days had been genuinely restful -- the absence of deliveries creating a lightness, a freedom, the day stretching open like a hand unclenching. Now the rest days were the days when the machine ran hardest, because the machine had nothing to process except itself, and the self it was processing was increasingly difficult to maintain.

He thought about Priya. She was leaving in twelve days. Her six-week break was half over, and the return flight to London was booked and paid for, and the final-year placements were waiting, and the life she'd built -- the real life, the life with structure and purpose and a future -- was pulling her back with a gravity that Connor's world could not match.

He thought about Jake. Jake was still in KL -- Langkawi had been postponed because Jake had met an Italian girl named Chiara who worked at a bar on Changkat and Jake had decided, with the confident romanticism of a man whose decisions were made entirely by his limbic system, that Chiara was "the one." The one lasted approximately five days before Chiara left for Penang, but the postponement meant Jake was still here, still a presence, still the golden retriever in board shorts whose function in Connor's life was to be the friend who didn't question, didn't push, didn't see beneath the surface.

He thought about the money. RM12,180. *She'll be right.* The phrase arrived the way it always did -- automatic, reflexive, the Australian mantra that had carried him through twelve countries. But the phrase was beginning to sound, even to him, like something a man said when he was falling and couldn't reach the railing. He'd never had this much money in his life. The number sat in his banking app like a small monument, a stack of ringgit that represented four weeks of packages and sports bags and brown paper and blue doors and men who didn't make eye contact. The money was clean in his account and dirty in its origin and the difference between clean and dirty was a question Connor had stopped asking because asking was the first step on a road he couldn't afford to walk.

He went to the cinema. Pavilion KL, the mall in Bukit Bintang, where the multiplex had leather seats and air conditioning cold enough to make him shiver. He watched a Marvel film -- he couldn't remember which one by the end, they were all the same film now, the same indestructible heroes fighting the same impossible odds with the same outcome, the good guys winning, the bad guys losing, the universe restored. He ate popcorn and drank a Coke and sat in the dark and felt the comfort of clean rules and just consequences and nobody dying who didn't deserve to.

Bank balance: unchanged. RM12,180. The money sat there. The money waited.

**Day 28. Thursday. Chow Kit.**

The delivery to Auntie Lim was routine. Sports bag, 2.6 kilograms, taxi, drop, transfer. RM350. The wet market was in full morning cry -- fish sellers hawking in Malay and Cantonese, the ice on the tables melting in the heat, the smell of the sea competing with the smell of raw poultry and the sulfurous funk of the storm drains, the same rotten-egg stench that had hit Connor on his first night in Chinatown and that he'd stopped noticing weeks ago.

But something happened on the way back that Connor would not think about until much later.

He was walking through the market, past the stalls, past the vendors, past the displays of tropical fruit stacked in pyramids -- rambutans red and hairy, mangosteens purple and smooth, dragonfruit pink and alien. A woman bumped his shoulder. She was Malay, middle-aged, carrying a shopping bag in each hand, and the bump was accidental -- the crowded market, the narrow aisles, the inevitable physics of too many people in too small a space.

"Sorry, sorry," she said, in English, and then looked at his face and stopped.

She looked at him the way Mama Siti looked at him. The way Razak had looked at him in the office with the map. The way Mei Ling had looked at him at the reception counter. The way people looked at a person when they knew something about that person that the person didn't know about themselves.

"You're from the hostel," she said. "Petaling Street."

"Yeah, I--"

"I see you. Every Thursday. Walking through here with the bag." She shifted her shopping bags from one hand to the other, the gesture of a woman redistributing weight. "My stall is there." She pointed to a vegetable stall three metres away. "I sell kangkung and okra and I see everything from my stall."

Connor said nothing.

"Be careful, boy." She said *boy* the way Malaysian aunties said *boy* -- not as a diminutive but as a term of address that simultaneously acknowledged your existence and implied your stupidity. "The police come through here too. They see the same things I see."

She walked away. Her shopping bags swung at her sides. She didn't look back.

Connor stood in the market. The fruit pyramids rose around him. The vendors called. The ice melted. And the woman's words settled into him like rain into soil, reaching a depth that the surface warnings -- Priya's arguments, Tomoko's photos, Mei Ling's instruction -- had not reached, because this was not a warning from a friend or a journalist or a receptionist. This was a warning from a stranger. A vegetable seller. A woman who had no investment in Connor's survival except the basic, unremarkable human impulse to tell a person they are walking into traffic.

He went home. He didn't tell Felix about the woman. He wasn't sure why. Maybe it was because telling Felix about the checkpoint had led to the checkpoint being avoided, and telling Felix about Tomoko had led to the camera being stolen, and telling Felix about this woman would lead to -- what? What could Felix do about a vegetable seller in Chow Kit who had eyes?

He ate lunch. He met Jake for beers. He went to bed.

Bank balance: RM12,530.

**Day 29. Friday. Jalan Ipoh.**

Return leg. Mr. Tan. RM350. The delivery was unremarkable. The delivery was always unremarkable. That was the point.

Connor spent the afternoon with Jake at the Petronas Towers -- the skybridge tour, which Connor had been meaning to do since he arrived and hadn't because doing tourist things felt like regression, like admitting he was a tourist rather than a resident, a visitor rather than a local. But Jake wanted to go and Connor wanted to not think, and the Petronas Towers delivered on both counts: the skybridge was forty-one floors up, the city spread below like a circuitboard, the buildings and roads and parks and mosques miniaturised by distance into something comprehensible, something you could hold in your eye and know.

From the skybridge, you could see everything. Petaling Street, a sliver of red and gold in the urban grid. Bukit Bintang, its malls glinting. Chow Kit, a dense cluster of low-rise rooftops. Brickfields, identifiable by the temple towers. The North-South Expressway, a grey ribbon heading north toward Penang. The LRT lines, silver threads connecting the city's parts. And in the distance, green hills, and beyond the hills, more hills, and beyond those, the edge of the Malaysian peninsula, where the land ended and the sea began and the rest of the world waited.

"Dude," Jake said, pressing his forehead against the glass. "This is insane."

"Yeah."

"Like, we're literally standing between the tallest twin towers in the world. How is this our life?"

"It's pretty sick."

Jake took seventeen selfies. Connor took three. In one of them, looking at it later, he noticed his own reflection in the glass -- a figure standing against the city's grid, transparent, ghostlike, as though the city was already showing through him, as though he was already becoming less solid, less present, less there.

He posted the photo. Caption: *Standing on top of the world. KL, you absolute legend.* Forty-three likes.

Bank balance: RM12,880.

**Day 30. Saturday. Bukit Bintang.**

The drop to Danny at Lot 22B was the last of the week. Sports bag, heavier than usual, 4.1 kilograms. Danny was young -- mid-twenties, Chinese-Malaysian, thin, with the nervous energy of a person who was not at the top of any chain but was somewhere in the middle, the disposable middle, the part that could be replaced without the machine noticing.

Danny took the bag through a door in the back of a building that, from the front, looked like a defunct karaoke bar -- the sign still up, the neon tubes dark, the windows papered over. The interior, glimpsed briefly as Danny pulled the door open, was not a karaoke bar. It was a room with a table and scales and bags and the smell of something chemical that Connor's nose registered and his brain rejected.

The door closed. RM400. Higher than the others. Saturday deliveries paid more. Connor did not ask why.

He walked through Bukit Bintang in the late afternoon sun, the pavement crowded with Saturday shoppers, the monorail humming overhead, the durian stall pumping its signature aroma into the air. He felt the RM400 arrive in his account with the small, warm pulse of validation that each transfer produced, the Pavlovian response that the schedule had built into his nervous system -- delivery, transfer, dopamine. The cycle was complete. The cycle was repeating. The cycle was all there was.

Bank balance: RM13,280.

---

On Sunday, rest day, Connor sat on his bunk and opened the banking app and looked at the number and felt something he had never felt before.

The feeling was not happiness. Happiness was what he told himself it was -- the satisfaction of accumulation, the security of surplus, the quiet triumph of a man who was making it work. But beneath the happiness, beneath the number, beneath the green bar graph that showed his balance climbing week over week in a line that looked like success, there was something else.

The something else was this: the number was not a number. The number was a weight. Each ringgit was a gram. Each transfer was a delivery. Each delivery was a package he'd never opened, a bag he'd never checked, a sports-bag-sized piece of the unknown carried across a city that would kill him for carrying it. The balance in his account was an inventory of risk, denominated in currency, and the inventory was growing, and the risk was growing with it, and the growth was silent and smooth and invisible the way all growth was when you weren't looking.

RM13,280. In thirty days. For carrying things.

**Day 31. Monday.**

Jalan Ipoh. Mr. Tan. RM350. The routine.

Something happened on the way home that was not part of the routine.

The Grab dropped Connor on Jalan Sultan, two blocks from the hostel, because a food delivery truck was blocking the lane and the driver refused to navigate around it with the particular stubbornness of a KL Grab driver encountering a situation that required effort. Connor walked. The midday sun was a white disc in a white sky, the heat landing on exposed skin like a physical weight, the humidity turning every breath into something that had to be earned.

He passed the Guan Di Temple. The red doors were open, the interior visible -- the altar, the smoke, the golden statue of the Chinese god of war sitting in his niche with the calm authority of someone who had been settling disputes for two thousand years. An old man knelt at the altar, burning joss paper, the flames leaping and dying in the still air. The smoke rose straight up, undisturbed.

Connor paused. He'd passed the temple every day for a month and had never gone inside. Today, he stepped through the door.

The interior was cool -- not air-conditioned cool but the stone-and-shade cool of a building designed for a tropical climate, the thick walls absorbing the heat and releasing it slowly, the open doorway creating a draft that moved the incense smoke in lazy spirals. The smell was intense: sandalwood incense, burning paper, the waxy fragrance of red candles, and beneath it all, the dusty sweetness of old wood and old gold.

He stood in the middle of the temple and felt something shift. Not a thought -- a sensation. The sensation of being very small in a very old place, the same feeling he'd had at the Hindu temple in Brickfields, the same feeling that religious architecture was designed to produce: the dissolution of the ego, the reminder that the self was temporary and the building was not.

He looked at the altar. Guan Di sat in gold, his beard flowing, his halberd beside him, his expression carrying the particular serenity of a deity who had seen everything human beings could do to each other and had decided to help anyway.

Connor didn't pray. He didn't know how to pray, and if he had known, he wouldn't have known what to pray for, because the thing he needed was not divine intervention but the human courage to stop doing what he was doing, and courage was not something you could request from a statue, however gold, however serene.

But he stood there. For three minutes, in the cool and the smoke, he stood and felt the smallness and let it hold him. Then he left. The heat hit him at the door. The city resumed. He walked home with the feeling fading and by the time he reached the hostel it was gone, replaced by the afternoon routine, the scrolling, the performing, the slow, warm erosion of everything that was not the machine.

---

**Day 32. Tuesday.**

Brickfields. Blue Door. RM350. Routine.

In the evening, he received an email from his sister.

Megan Briggs, senior analyst, accounting firm, Sydney. The email was brief, as Megan's communications always were -- she wrote the way she lived, efficiently, without excess, each sentence carrying exactly the information it needed and not a syllable more.

> Connor,
>
> Mum told me you're staying in Malaysia for a while. She's worried. She's always worried about you but she's more worried than usual, which means something is different, even if she can't say what.
>
> I'm not going to lecture you. You're 27 and you've been doing this for four years and nothing I say will change your mind. But I want you to know that Dad is not well. He hasn't told you because he doesn't want you to come home out of guilt. He has high blood pressure and his doctor has put him on medication and reduced his golf to once a week, which is making him miserable.
>
> I'm telling you this not to make you feel bad but because I think you should know. And because I think, at some point, you might want to consider that the people who love you are getting older, and the time you have with them is not unlimited, and spending it on the other side of the world carrying a phone you never answer is a choice that has consequences for more people than just you.
>
> That's all. Take care of yourself.
>
> Megan

Connor read the email three times. The words were sharp -- Megan's words were always sharp, honed by years of numbers and reports and a lifetime of saying difficult things concisely so the numbers did the feeling for her. But the sharpness was a surface; beneath it, in the spaces between the sentences, was something softer. Something that sounded like: *I'm your sister and I love you and I'm scared and I don't know how to say it because we've never been good at saying it.*

His father. High blood pressure. Medication. Golf reduced. The images arrived: David Briggs, sixty-one, square-shouldered, the property developer who'd built half of Hawthorn's new townhouses, reduced to a pill organiser and a doctor's caution. His father, who never complained, who never showed weakness, who'd driven Connor to the airport and said *the rules don't care who you are* and meant it and been right.

Connor typed a reply:

> Thanks for telling me, Megs. Tell Dad I'll call him this week. And tell Mum not to worry.

He sent it. He put down the phone. He stared at the wall of the common room -- the bookshelf, the TV, the red lanterns -- and thought about consequences, and time, and the brutal arithmetic: earning RM13,000 in a country that would kill him while his father was taking medication in a country where he could have been safe.

The image came without permission: David Briggs at the kitchen table in Hawthorn, the pill organiser open in front of him -- one of those plastic trays with the days of the week printed on each compartment, the kind of object that belonged in the homes of the very old, not in the hands of a sixty-one-year-old property developer who had built half a suburb with those hands. His father's hands. The hands that had poured foundations and signed contracts and gripped Connor's shoulder at the airport and held on for a beat longer than the protocol allowed. Those hands, now sorting pills. Monday through Sunday. The small, coloured capsules that were keeping his blood from doing what blood, left to its own devices, apparently wanted to do -- which was to press against the walls of the vessels that carried it with a force that could kill the man who carried them.

Connor did the arithmetic. He couldn't help it. The arithmetic was reflexive, the way flinching was reflexive, a thing the body did before the mind could intervene. His father was sixty-one. The life expectancy for an Australian male was eighty-two. That was twenty-one years. Twenty-one years of pills and reduced golf and his mother watching his father's face for the signs of something worse. Twenty-one years was seven thousand, six hundred and sixty-five days. Connor had been in KL for thirty-two of them. Thirty-two days of packages and sports bags and blue doors, during which his father's blood pressure had been doing its quiet, domestic violence, and Connor had not called, had not come home, had not been there for any of it, because being there would have required being someone who did not carry things through Chow Kit for money.

He could call now. He could pick up the phone and dial the Melbourne number and say the words: *I'm coming home, Dad. I'll be on the next flight.* He could feel the words forming -- the shape of them in his mouth, the weight of them in his chest, the specific, physical relief they would produce, the way setting down a heavy bag produces relief, the sudden lightness of a body freed from cargo. He reached for the phone. His hand moved. And the machine intercepted it -- not with logic, not with argument, but with the blank, smooth refusal of a system that had learned to redirect impulse before it became action. The phone stayed on the table. The call was not made. The words dissolved back into the silence they had come from, and in their place the machine substituted the familiar calculation: the RM13,280 in the account, the schedule that continued, the packages that needed carrying, the steady accumulation that felt, from inside the machine, like purpose.

He picked up the phone. He opened the banking app instead. The green bar graph climbed. The number sat. And the email from Megan -- the email with its sharp sentences and its soft centre, the email that weighed nothing in megabytes and everything in grams -- joined the list of things Connor had received and registered and filed in the part of his mind where warnings went to be acknowledged and then, systematically, ignored.

---

---

**Day 33. Wednesday. Rest day.**

He called his father.

David Briggs picked up on the fourth ring, which was unusual -- David Briggs picked up on the first ring, always had, the reflexive grab of a man who'd spent thirty years taking calls from site managers and councils and lawyers. The fourth ring meant he'd been looking for the phone, or hesitating, or both.

"Connor." The voice was the same -- square, solid, Australian in the way that eucalyptus trees were Australian, deeply rooted and slightly weathered. "How are you, mate?"

"I'm good, Dad. How are you?"

"Can't complain. Well, I can, but your mother tells me nobody wants to hear it." A chuckle. The chuckle was the same too -- dry, brief, the humour of a man who rationed his laughter the way he rationed his affection, not because he lacked it but because he believed economy was a virtue.

They talked for twelve minutes. Connor learned that his father's blood pressure was "under control" (David's term), that the medication was "a nuisance" (David's term for anything that reminded him of mortality), and that golf once a week was "criminal" (David's term for anything that prevented him from playing golf). They talked about the Melbourne property market, which David tracked the way astronomers tracked the stars -- with precision, with passion, with the conviction that the patterns meant something. They talked about Megan's promotion. They talked about the dog, a labrador named Bruce, who had developed a limp.

They did not talk about Connor's life. This was the protocol: David asked "How are you?", Connor said "Good," and the subject was closed. David did not ask what Connor did for money, where he slept, who his friends were, or when he was coming home. These questions lived in the space between father and son like furniture in a dark room -- present, immovable, navigated by memory.

At the eleven-minute mark, David said: "Your mother tells me you've been in KL a while now. She says you might stay longer."

"Yeah. Thinking about it."

"Right." A pause. The pause was David's version of a paragraph break, a space in which unspoken things accumulated. "Just -- look after yourself, Connor. That's all."

"I will, Dad."

"I know you will. You're a sensible bloke." He said it without irony, which was worse than irony, because irony would have acknowledged the gap between the statement and the reality, and the absence of irony meant David believed it, the way parents believe things about their children that the children have long since disproven.

"Love you, Dad."

"Love you too, mate. Call your mother. She misses you."

The call ended. Connor sat on the rooftop with the phone in his hand and the Petronas Towers in his eyes and the word *sensible* in his ears and the word was wrong, the word was the wrongest word in the English language applied to the most wrong person in the most wrong situation, and the wrongness hurt in a way that the warnings hadn't, because the warnings came from people who saw the truth and the word *sensible* came from a man who loved the lie, and the lie was the only thing Connor had given his father in four years.

---

**Day 34. Thursday.**

Chow Kit. Auntie Lim. RM350.

The vegetable seller was at her stall. She saw him. She didn't speak. She didn't need to. Her eyes tracked him as he walked through the market with the sports bag, and her expression -- the same expression from last week, the expression of a woman who sees a boy walking toward something that will hurt him -- was the speech. The silence was louder than the words.

Connor walked faster. He delivered the package. He went home.

That evening, Tomoko was at the reception counter when he came down for dinner. She had a new camera -- smaller, cheaper, a Fujifilm compact that looked like a downgrade from the Nikon the way a car looked like a downgrade from an airplane. But it was a camera, and it had a lens, and the lens was pointed at nothing in particular, but its presence was a statement.

*I'm still watching. The camera was stolen but the watcher was not. You can take the tool but you can't take the eye.*

She didn't look at Connor. She didn't need to. The camera was the communication. The camera said: *I have a cloud. I have contacts. I have patience. And I am not done.*

Connor went to dinner. He ate roti canai at the mamak stall and watched the evening traffic on Jalan Sultan and thought about cameras and clouds and women from Osaka who didn't give up and wondered, briefly, whether not giving up was a form of kindness or a form of cruelty, and decided it was both, the way most true things were both.

---

He closed the app. He opened Instagram. He posted a photo of the Petronas Towers at sunset -- the one Jake had taken, the one where the light turned the silver cladding to gold. Caption: *Living the dream. No alarm clock. No boss. Just sunsets and good vibes.* Twenty-two hashtags.

Sixty-one likes.

The likes were the smallest number he cared about and the largest number anyone would see. The bank balance was the largest number he cared about and the number no one would see. Between the two numbers -- between the public metric of a curated life and the private metric of an illegal one -- Connor Briggs existed, a man with two phones and two identities and two accounts, one that counted followers and one that counted ringgit, and both of them were lies and both of them were true and the difference between the lies and the truth was a question he would never ask because asking was the thing that would end everything.

He put down the phone. Both phones. He lay on Bed 7 and listened to the building settle around him -- the pipes ticking, the wood groaning in the heat, the slow respiration of a structure that had been breathing since 1928 and would keep breathing long after the man on the mattress stopped. The ceiling fan turned above him. *Tick, tick, tick.* He thought: *I should stop.*

He didn't stop.

The money was too easy. The routine was too comfortable. The stopping would require a confrontation with Felix that he couldn't envision and a conversation with the police that he couldn't face and a phone call to his parents that he couldn't make. The stopping would require becoming a different person, and Connor had spent twenty-seven years becoming this person, and this person was the only person he knew how to be.

So he didn't stop. And the days passed. And the money grew. And the packages moved through the city like blood through veins, invisible and essential and alive, and the man who carried them moved too, through streets he'd learned and markets he'd memorised and doors he'd opened without asking what was behind them, and the moving was so fluid and the earning was so regular and the lie was so complete that it felt, in every way that mattered, like a life.

The life that was ending. The life that was, even now, in its final weeks, counting down toward a bus station and a suitcase and a dog that could smell the truth through any amount of tape and nylon and denial.

But that was later. Now there was only the easy money and the easy days and the ceiling fan turning in the dorm where a name waited in the wood, the same name that had waited for the last one, the same patience, the same silence.
