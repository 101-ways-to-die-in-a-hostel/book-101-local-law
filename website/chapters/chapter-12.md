# Chapter 12: Don't Ask

Monday morning arrived with the smell of rain on hot concrete and the sound of Mei Ling arguing with a Grab driver on the street below.

Connor heard it through the air well -- the rapid-fire Cantonese that Mei Ling deployed in situations that required a precision weapon rather than the polite English she used at reception. The driver was arguing back. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that sounded like a negotiation conducted at swordpoint, each syllable a thrust, each pause a recalibration. It ended the way Mei Ling's arguments always ended: with the sound of a car door closing, an engine starting, and silence. The silence of victory.

Connor reached for the phone on his mattress. Not the old phone. The new one -- the Samsung, the burner, the work phone, which he was already thinking of with the casual familiarity of a tool you've owned for years rather than hours. The screen showed one message, received at 7:14 AM:

*Package ready. Room 301. Come when you're dressed.*

He swung his legs off Bed 7. The morning routine -- board shorts, singlet (today: LIFE'S A BEACH in fading letters), flip-flops, leather bracelet. He splashed water on his face in the second-floor bathroom. The mirror above the sink was spotted with age and humidity, the silvering gone dark at the edges, and the face that looked back at him was the face he always saw: tanned, stubbled, squinting. The face of a man who had figured things out.

He climbed to the third floor. Felix's door was closed. Connor knocked twice -- a pattern that was already becoming habit, the specific two-knock rhythm that meant *it's me*, that meant *I'm ready*, that meant *I'm the one who doesn't ask questions*.

The door opened. Felix was dressed, groomed, the private room behind him neat and intentional in the way Felix's world was always neat and intentional. The bed made with hospital corners. A laptop open on the desk, displaying something Felix minimised before Connor could see it. The window overlooking Petaling Street, shuttered against the morning light, the wooden slats throwing striped shadows across the floor.

On the desk, beside the closed laptop, a package.

This one was different.

The previous packages had been small -- shoebox-sized, wrapped in brown paper, light enough to carry in one hand. This was larger. A sports bag -- black nylon, generic, the kind sold at every market stall in Southeast Asia for thirty ringgit. Zippered shut. Not sealed with tape the way the brown paper packages had been, just zipped, the two halves of the zipper meeting in the middle with a casualness that was either confident or careless.

Connor looked at the bag. The bag looked like a bag.

"Jalan Ipoh," Felix said. "Mr. Tan. Same as the schedule. The address is in your work phone -- I texted it last night."

"Got it."

Connor reached for the bag. Lifted it. And paused.

It was heavier than the packages. Not dramatically heavier -- not the weight of bricks or metal -- but heavier than phone chargers. Heavier than cables. He felt the weight settle into his arm, into his shoulder, and the weight had a texture to it, a density that suggested whatever was inside was packed tightly, compressed, occupying less space than its mass suggested it should.

"What's in this one?" The words came out before the machine could stop them, emerging from the same place the hesitation had lived -- the shrinking territory of Connor's self-preservation, the last patch of ground where doubt still grew.

Felix looked at him. The look lasted one second. In that second, something moved behind Felix's eyes -- a calculation, a recalibration, the quick assessment of a man who manages risk for a living and has just detected a variable. Then the look was gone and Felix was Felix again, warm and easy and unconcerned.

"Phone components. The same as always. Just a bigger order." He gestured at the bag. "Mr. Tan's shop is expanding. He needs more stock."

"Right. Yeah. Course." Connor hoisted the bag onto his shoulder. The weight distributed. It became ordinary. He was a backpacker with a bag, and in this city, in this neighbourhood, that was the most invisible thing you could be.

"Connor."

He turned at the door. Felix was standing by the desk, one hand on the closed laptop, and his expression was the one he wore when he was about to say something he wanted Connor to remember.

"Don't open the bag."

"I wasn't going to--"

"The clients are particular about packaging. If the seal is broken -- even if you rezip it -- they'll know, and they won't accept the delivery. It's a quality control thing. The components are packed in a specific configuration. If you disturb it, the whole shipment has to be redone."

"Mate, I wasn't going to open it."

"I know you weren't. I'm just telling you."

The words were reasonable. The tone was reasonable. Everything about the exchange was so perfectly reasonable that it should have been unremarkable, a boss telling an employee to follow procedure, nothing more. But there was something in the instruction -- the specificity of it, the pre-emptive quality, the way Felix had answered a question Connor hadn't asked -- that lingered. Like a taste you can't identify. Like a sound in an empty room.

"Have a good run," Felix said, and smiled, and the smile closed the conversation the way a lid closes a box.

---

The Grab from Petaling Street to Jalan Ipoh took twenty-two minutes.

Connor sat in the back seat with the black sports bag on his lap. The driver -- a young Malay man with a skull-cap and a dashboard Quran -- drove in silence, the radio tuned to a station playing dangdut, the Indonesian pop genre that sounded like someone had put a love song and a drum machine in a blender and poured the result directly into Connor's neural pathways. The music was hypnotic, repetitive, the kind of sound that fills a car the way water fills a glass -- completely, leaving no room for thought.

Which was useful, because thought was the enemy this morning.

The bag sat on his lap. His hands rested on the nylon. Through the fabric, he could feel the shape of the contents -- not individual items but a mass, a single compressed form, wrapped in something, packed tight. The shape was rectangular, approximately the size of a laptop, but heavier. Denser. His fingers found the edge of the zipper -- the small metal tab, warm from the car's interior, resting against the nylon like a door handle.

He could open it. Right now, in the back of this Grab, with the driver absorbed in dangdut and the traffic crawling past the Chow Kit market. He could unzip the bag six inches, look inside, see the phone components or the chargers or whatever was in there, confirm the story, and zip it back up. Felix would never know. Mr. Tan would never know. The zip would realign. The "quality control configuration" would be undisturbed.

His thumb found the zipper tab. Pressed against the metal. Felt the tiny ridge of teeth beneath.

The car stopped at a traffic light. Outside the window, a billboard rose above the shophouses: POLIS DIRAJA MALAYSIA -- the Royal Malaysia Police crest, blue and gold, above a public safety message in Malay and English. The English text read: KEEPING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFE. Below the crest, in smaller text: REPORT DRUG ACTIVITY -- 999.

Connor looked at the billboard. The billboard looked back. The light changed. The car moved. The billboard slid away.

His thumb was still on the zipper. He could feel his own pulse through the pad of his thumb, the blood fast and hard, the body already deciding what the mind refused to. Open the bag. See what's inside. Know the truth.

*And then what?*

The question arrived with the force of practical reality. If he opened the bag and found phone components, he'd feel stupid for doubting Felix. If he opened the bag and found something else -- something that was not phone components, something that the billboards warned about, something that the airport signs promised death for carrying -- then he would know. And knowing would require action. Knowing would require a decision: continue, or stop. And stopping meant losing the RM2,000 a week. Stopping meant losing Felix. Stopping meant going back to RM14 flat whites and his parents' deposit and the slow, grinding arithmetic of a life that didn't add up.

Not knowing was easier. Not knowing was free.

His thumb moved away from the zipper. The bag sat on his lap, unopened, and the not-knowing settled over him like a blanket -- warm, comforting, the comfort of a man who preferred the dark room he was sitting in to the light that would show him what was in it.

The Grab pulled up outside a shophouse on Jalan Ipoh. Connor got out. The heat hit him like a wall of wet wool. He slung the bag over his shoulder, walked to the metal roller door that was half-raised, ducked under, and found Mr. Tan.

Mr. Tan was approximately fifty, thin, with the compressed energy of a man who had been doing this for decades and had reduced the process to its most efficient form. He took the bag. Unzipped it -- Connor watched, trying to see inside, but Mr. Tan's body blocked the view -- inspected the contents for approximately three seconds, rezipped, nodded once.

No handshake. No conversation. The roller door descended.

Connor's work phone buzzed: RM350 transferred.

He walked back to the main road in the sun. The delivery had taken four minutes. Three hundred and fifty ringgit for four minutes of walking. The mathematics of it was so absurd that it functioned as its own anaesthetic: anything that paid this well had to be legitimate, because the alternative -- that it paid this well because it was dangerous, because the risk premium was built into the rate, because the money was compensation for the probability of catastrophic consequences -- was a thought Connor did not have the architecture to construct.

He flagged a Grab. Went home.

---

The Lantern Hostel at midday was in its somnolent phase -- the quiet hours between check-out and the afternoon rush, when the building drifted in a warm stupor of ceiling fans and empty corridors. The common room TV was playing a Malay cooking show to nobody. The bookshelf had acquired a new addition: *Shantaram*, dog-eared, its spine cracked at page 200, the exact point where every backpacker in Southeast Asia stopped reading *Shantaram*.

Connor came through the front door and turned right toward the staircase, his daypack over one shoulder, the black sports bag no longer with him, the RM350 warming his account, the morning's delivery already migrating from *thing I did* to *thing that happened*, the active voice becoming passive, the agency dissolving.

"Connor."

He stopped. Mei Ling was behind the reception counter.

She was always behind the reception counter. The counter was her territory, the wooden surface scarred with seventeen years of key-drops and ledger-signings and the casual violence of backpackers leaning too hard on cheap wood. Mei Ling presided over it with the calm authority of someone who had seen every kind of guest pass through and had catalogued them all.

Today she was not doing what she usually did -- the quiet busywork of reception, the shuffling of papers, the checking of the ledger. She was standing. Arms at her sides. Looking at Connor with an expression he had never seen on her face before.

The expression was difficult. It contained several things at once, layered like the sediment in old rock: concern at the base, irritation above that, and at the surface, the particular exhaustion of someone who has watched a preventable disaster approach and has been unable to stop it.

"Can I speak with you?"

"Yeah, sure. What's up?"

She didn't answer immediately. She looked past him, at the front door, at the street beyond where the phone repair shop's fluorescent light was visible. Then she looked back.

"Come here. To the counter."

Connor approached. The reception counter was chest-high, the wood dark with age, a bell and a hand-sanitiser bottle and a laminated card of house rules the only objects on its surface. Behind Mei Ling, the wall of guest keys -- metal hooks, most empty at this hour. The hostel's guest ledger, thick and cloth-bound, sitting on a shelf beside a box of passports being held for current guests.

Mei Ling placed both hands flat on the counter. Her nails were short, unpainted, practical. Her polo shirt -- white, red lantern logo on the breast pocket -- was pressed. Everything about Mei Ling was pressed: her clothes, her expression, her patience, which she was pressing to its limit.

"I see you," she said. "Every morning. Going out with a bag that isn't yours. Coming back without it. Sometimes twice a day."

Connor's stomach performed a small, cold contraction. He smiled. The Instagram smile -- wide, warm, weaponised.

"That's my freelance gear, Mei. Laptop, chargers, camera stuff. I work from cafés."

"Your laptop is in your dorm. I saw it on your bunk this morning when Aisha was cleaning."

The smile held. Behind it, the machine was running -- the rationalisation engine, the defence system, the twenty-seven years of practised evasion that Connor deployed with the fluency of a native speaker. "Sometimes I don't bring the laptop. Sometimes it's just camera gear. I'm doing some photography work for a client--"

"Connor." Her voice cut through his sentence with the precision of someone who had spent two years learning when guests were lying, which was most of the time, and had decided that today she was not going to let the lie land. "Please be careful what you carry for other people."

The sentence arrived in the space between them and stayed there. It did not move. It did not qualify itself. It sat on the reception counter like a stone, and Mei Ling looked at Connor with the expression of a woman who had just placed her last card on the table and was waiting to see if the man across from her was capable of reading it.

Connor heard the words. The words were clear. The words were, in fact, so clear that they required no interpretation, no context, no additional information. *Be careful what you carry for other people.* It was not a riddle. It was not a proverb. It was not Mama Siti's Malay wisdom, opaque and beautiful and ignorable. It was a direct, English-language warning from a young woman who was looking at him with something very close to fear.

He heard it. He processed it. And then the machine ran.

*She's just doing her job. It's a liability thing. The hostel has a policy about guests' belongings. She's covering herself. She doesn't know anything -- she's making assumptions because she's seen me carrying bags. Everyone carries bags. I'm a backpacker. Bags are what we do.*

"Mei, I appreciate the concern. But I'm a big boy. I know what I'm doing."

She held his gaze for a long moment. Behind her round face and her practical ponytail and her pressed polo shirt, behind the reception counter and the guest ledger and the laminated house rules, something was happening -- a decision being made, a line being drawn, the quiet recalibration of a person who has extended a hand and felt it pushed away.

"The rules are posted," she said, her voice flat now, the concern drained away, replaced by the professional neutrality of an employee returning to protocol. She pointed at the laminated card on the counter. Connor's eyes followed her finger to the bottom of the list, where rule number 6 was printed in red:

**Guests are responsible for knowing and obeying Malaysian law. The hostel is not liable.**

"I've read them," Connor said. He hadn't.

"Good."

She sat down behind the counter. Opened the ledger. Began writing. The conversation was over. The warning had been issued, received, and dismissed, and Mei Ling had added Connor to the mental ledger she kept -- the one that wasn't cloth-bound, the one that tracked not room assignments and payment dates but the guests she expected never to see again.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters were visible under the peeling paint -- brush strokes from 1943, administrative notations from an occupation that had used this building for purposes the building still remembered. Connor walked past them the way he walked past everything: without looking, without reading, without knowing that the characters he passed every day said *processing room*, which in 1943 meant something no one in the building wanted to remember.

---

The afternoon unfolded in the way KL afternoons unfolded: slowly, hotly, with the gathering promise of rain.

Connor was in the common room, on the sofa, doing his impression of a man at work. His laptop was open. The Pacific Soul Retreats account was loaded. He was choosing between three stock photos of a yoga retreat in Ubud -- all identical, all featuring a woman in white doing a pose that looked like she was trying to reach something on a high shelf -- when the rain began.

It didn't start gradually. KL rain arrived like a decision -- one moment the sky was grey and swollen, the next the air was water, the zinc roofs of Petaling Street hammered with a sound like ten thousand drummers playing the same beat. Rain cascaded down the air well in sheets, turning the courtyard into a small waterfall. The gutters overflowed. The smell changed -- the hot concrete and diesel of a tropical afternoon replaced instantly by the green, electric smell of ozone and wet earth.

Connor closed his laptop and watched. The rain was extraordinary in the way KL rain was always extraordinary -- not the grey drizzle of Melbourne but a vertical ocean, a biblical demonstration of water's capacity for volume. It hit the pavement so hard it bounced, creating a secondary mist that rose from the ground and merged with the falling rain, so that for a few minutes the street was barely visible, a grey-white haze punctuated by the red taillights of stalled traffic.

The hostel filled. Travelers who had been out on afternoon excursions came streaming through the front door, laughing, drenched, wringing out hats and squeezing water from hair. The common room's population tripled in ten minutes. Conversations started the way conversations always started in hostels during rain: Where are you from? How long are you here? Have you been to...?

Connor was drawn into a group. Three Scandinavians -- two Swedish women and a Danish man -- who were sharing a bottle of duty-free vodka mixed with canned passion fruit juice, a combination that tasted like a tropical sunset designed by someone who had never seen one. The Swedish women were medical students on placement in Penang, down to KL for the weekend. The Danish man, Lars, was a software developer "on sabbatical," which appeared to mean "drinking in hostels until the money ran out."

They were loud. They were fun. They were the specific kind of fun that hostels manufactured -- the effortless, temporary, chemistry-of-strangers fun that happened when you put young people from different countries in a room with alcohol and rain.

Connor drank. He told his stories -- the Bali stories, the Cambodia stories, the time he'd ridden a motorcycle across Vietnam without a licence ("Mate, the cops just waved me through, it's different in Asia"). He was good at this. This was his skill, his actual skill: the transformation of unremarkable experiences into compelling narratives, the alchemy of turning a cheap holiday into an epic. He held the group. He made them laugh. He made the Swedish women lean in. He made Lars nod with the earnest agreement of a man three vodkas deep.

For an hour, he was the person he believed himself to be. The traveler. The storyteller. The one who had figured it out.

Then one of the Swedish women -- Astrid, blonde, tall, with the angular features of a Bergman film -- said something that detonated quietly in the middle of the conversation.

"We had a lecture before we came," she said. "At the university. On practicing medicine abroad. Part of the briefing was about local laws."

She was two vodkas in, her English precise and musical in the way Swedish-accented English was, every vowel clear. She was talking to the group generally but looking at Connor specifically, the way people looked at the person who talked the most.

"Did you know that Malaysia has the death penalty for drugs?" she said. "Like, actual death penalty. Not life in prison -- death. If you're caught with more than fifty grams of methamphetamine, you're automatically charged with trafficking. Mandatory death sentence."

The common room was warm. The rain hammered outside.

"Yeah, they've got signs at the airport," Connor said. "Mental, isn't it?"

"We had to sign a declaration before we came. That we understood the drug laws and wouldn't carry anything for anyone. Even prescriptions -- our professor said you can get into trouble for carrying painkillers without documentation."

Lars, the Danish man, nodded. "Same in Singapore. My friend's cousin -- this was ten years ago -- got caught at the Causeway with hash. He was in prison for two years. And that's light. In Malaysia, with the quantity they're talking about..."

He drew a finger across his throat. The gesture was theatrical, clumsy, the kind of thing a drunk man does when he thinks he's being dramatic. But the meaning was unambiguous.

"That's for dealers though, isn't it?" Connor said. "Like, actual drug dealers. Big fish. They're not going to execute some backpacker who's got a joint in his pocket."

"The law doesn't distinguish," Astrid said. She said it the way medical students said things -- with the flat certainty of someone quoting a textbook. "Over fifty grams, you're presumed to be trafficking. The burden of proof reverses. You have to prove you *weren't* trafficking. And the mandatory sentence is death."

"Mandatory meaning--"

"The judge has no choice. It's automatic. You're convicted, you're sentenced. There's an appeal process but the success rate is..." She shrugged. The shrug contained the entire weight of a legal system designed to be merciless.

"That's insane," Jake said. Jake had appeared from somewhere, beer in hand, attracted by the gravity of a group. "They can't just kill you for carrying drugs. Like, there have to be exceptions. For foreigners."

"There are no exceptions for foreigners," Astrid said. "They've executed Australians. Nigerians. Iranians. A British woman in the eighties, though I think that was in a different country. The point is, the law applies to everyone."

"They've executed Australians?" Connor's voice did something he didn't intend -- it rose half an octave, the register of surprise rather than the register of casual dismissal. He corrected immediately. "I mean, that's -- when was this? Ages ago, right?"

"I don't know the details. Our professor mentioned it. The point was clear: know the law before you go."

"Right. Well, I'm not carrying any drugs, so." He laughed. The laugh was supposed to close the topic the way a door closes a room -- firmly, completely, with the clear message that whatever was on the other side was not relevant to whoever was on this side. But the door didn't close all the way. A draught came through.

He drank his vodka-passion-fruit. It was warm now, the ice melted, the taste cloying. The rain was beginning to ease, the percussion on the zinc roof fading from fury to murmur. The common room was steamy, the air thick with the humidity of twenty wet bodies and the smell of cheap vodka and rainwater.

Connor's mind was doing something it rarely did: operating on two levels simultaneously. The surface level -- the talking, the laughing, the performing -- continued without interruption. Beneath it, a second process was running, involuntary and unwelcome, playing back Astrid's words in a loop.

*Mandatory death sentence. Over fifty grams. The law doesn't distinguish. No exceptions for foreigners.*

The sports bag he'd carried that morning. The weight of it. The density. The rectangular shape, compressed, heavier than phone chargers. How heavy was fifty grams? He didn't know. He'd never thought in grams. Fifty grams was... the weight of a few coins? The weight of a small chocolate bar? The weight of something that could fit in the palm of your hand?

*What was in the bag?*

The question surfaced, bright and sharp, like a fish breaking water. He looked at it. The machine started running.

*Phone components. Felix said phone components. Felix has never lied to me. The bag was full of phone components for Mr. Tan's shop, which is expanding. It was heavier because it was a bigger order. Simple. Logical. Done.*

The fish sank. The water closed. The surface was smooth again.

"Anyway," Connor said, refilling his cup from the vodka bottle, "who wants to hear about the time I accidentally crashed a wedding in Bali?"

The group laughed. The conversation moved on. The rain stopped. KL's sky cracked open and revealed the late-afternoon sun, which hit the wet streets and turned them to mirrors and made everything -- the shophouses, the temples, the market stalls, the Petronas Towers in the distance -- glow with the specific, temporary beauty that follows a tropical downpour, the beauty that makes you forget what came before and not think about what comes next.

---

That night, Connor lay in Bed 7 and could not sleep.

This was unusual. Connor's relationship with sleep was the same as his relationship with most things: uncomplicated, requiring no effort, arriving when expected. He typically fell asleep within minutes of closing his eyes, his consciousness dimming like a phone screen timing out, the day's inputs dissolving into the static of dreams that he never remembered.

Tonight the static wouldn't come.

The dorm was dark. The ceiling fan turned. The French backpacker above was asleep. Two beds over, the Korean girl's earbuds emitted a faint tinny pulse. Through the air well, the residual sounds of the city's midnight -- a motorcycle, a distant stereo, a cat in the alley -- filtered up through the building's open core and settled into the room like sediment.

Connor's mind was replaying the afternoon's conversation. Not all of it -- not the Bali wedding story or Lars's software sabbatical or the Swedish women's medical placements. Just one part. Just Astrid's voice, precise and Swedish-accented, saying: *The law doesn't distinguish.*

He turned over. The mattress squeaked. The thin foam compressed under his shoulder with the familiar inadequacy of hostel bedding. He stared at the wooden slats of the bunk above him, at the stickers -- BINTANG BEER, FULL MOON PARTY KOH PHANGAN, a Thai flag, a peace sign -- and tried to think about something else.

*RM2,000 a week. That's what matters. That's the reality. Not some hypothetical, paranoid, what-if scenario about drug laws that don't apply to me because I'm not carrying drugs.*

*Am I carrying drugs?*

The question came. It was not the first time it had come. But it was the first time it stayed.

He lay in the dark and held the question and looked at it the way you look at something you've found in a drawer that you don't recognise -- turning it over, trying to determine if it's valuable or dangerous or both. The question had weight. It had the same weight as the sports bag -- the weight of something compressed, dense, occupying less space than its mass should allow.

He thought about the bag. The black nylon. The zipper. The rectangular shape inside. The way Mr. Tan had unzipped it with his body blocking the view. The way Felix had said *don't open it* with the specific emphasis of a man who was not talking about quality control.

He thought about Mei Ling. *Be careful what you carry for other people.* The stone she'd placed on the counter between them, the stone he'd stepped over.

He thought about the burner phone on the mattress beside him. The work phone. The corporate-policy phone. The phone that legitimate import-export businesses definitely gave their field staff, because that was how the corporate world worked, obviously, everyone knew that.

He thought about Priya's face in the common room two days ago. *It looks like something I've read about.*

He thought about Tomoko's voice. *The people Felix knows are not who he says they are.*

He thought about Mama Siti's proverb. *He who eats the chilli feels the heat.*

He thought about Astrid's words. *Mandatory death sentence. No exceptions for foreigners.*

The thoughts circled. They moved through his mind the way the ceiling fan moved through the humid air -- around and around, never arriving anywhere, never resolving, just circulating. Each thought produced a counter-thought. Each doubt produced a defence. The machine ran. But tonight the machine was not running smoothly. Tonight there was grit in the gears, sand in the engine, the accumulated friction of too many warnings dismissed and too many questions unasked.

Connor lay in the dark and felt something he had not felt since the night before his Monash University exam results came back, the exam he knew he'd failed, the exam that would confirm what he'd been running from for the rest of his life: that he was not the person he'd told everyone he was.

The feeling was fear.

Not the clean, sharp fear of immediate danger -- not the fear of a snake or a cliff or a car coming too fast. This was the other fear, the slow one, the one that lives in the back of the skull and wakes you at three AM and asks questions you can't answer. The fear of having done something that cannot be undone. The fear of a mistake so large it doesn't have edges, so you can't see where it ends and where you begin.

He thought: *I should open the next bag.*

The thought was clear. It was responsible. It was the thought of a man engaging with reality for the first time in weeks, reaching out to touch the surface of the water he'd been floating on and checking whether it was water or something else.

He thought: *If it's phone components, then I'm right and everyone else is wrong and I'll keep going and the money will come and everything will be fine.*

He thought: *If it's not phone components--*

He stopped. The sentence had a second half but the second half contained a world he could not enter from the warm safety of Bed 7 in Dorm 3 in the Lantern Hostel on Petaling Street in Kuala Lumpur. The second half contained police and lawyers and embassies and phone calls to his mother at three AM Melbourne time and the sound of her voice breaking and the word *mandatory* and the word *death* and the word *sentence*, and these words were too large for this small dark room with the ceiling fan and the French snorer and the stickers of places where people had been happy.

He didn't finish the sentence. He turned over. He pulled the blue Sea to Summit towel from beneath his pillow -- he slept with it there, always, a habit from years of hostels where things went missing -- and draped it across his chest. The microfiber was cool and smooth and smelled faintly of sunscreen and the Andaman Sea and all the places the towel had been with him, all the countries and the showers and the beaches and the laundry sinks where he'd washed it by hand and wrung it out and hung it to dry and known, in the simple, animal certainty of possession, that this was his.

The fear was still there. But the towel was on his chest and the fan was turning and the building was breathing and somewhere in the machinery of his mind, the operator was reaching for the off switch.

*She'll be right,* Connor thought. *She's always been right. I'll open the next one. Just to check. Just to be sure. And it'll be phone components, because it's always been phone components, and then I'll know, and I'll stop worrying, and everything will be fine.*

He wouldn't open the next one. He knew this already, the way you know you won't go to the gym tomorrow even as you set the alarm. The promise to check was a sedative, not a plan. It existed to get him through the night, to bridge the gap between the fear and the morning, to give the machine time to reassemble itself and smooth the grit from its gears and resume the production of certainty that was Connor Briggs's primary manufacture.

Sleep came. It took longer than usual -- forty minutes, maybe fifty, the longest he'd been awake in a hostel bed since the cockroach incident in Phnom Penh -- but it came, descending through the layers of his consciousness and carrying him down to a place where the questions didn't follow.

He slept. The phones lay beside him -- one cracked and sticker-covered and full of the life he showed the world, one clean and anonymous and full of a life he carried in the dark. The blue towel rose and fell on his chest with his breathing.

Beneath his hand, unlit, unfelt, the name in the bed frame waited.

L-E-N-A.

She had laid in this exact position. She had held this exact fear. She had told herself the same lies, in the same dark, in the same bed, with the same fan turning overhead. And she had not opened the bag, and she had not asked the question, and the machine had run, and the morning had come, and she had carried the next one and the next one and the next one until the morning came when the bag didn't matter anymore because the police were at the bus station and the handcuffs were cold and the word *mandatory* was no longer theoretical.

Lena was in Kajang Prison, forty kilometres south of this bed. She had a number now instead of a name. She had a cell instead of a dorm. She had a sentence instead of a future. And the bed frame still carried her name, five letters carved with a fingernail or a coin, a message to whoever came next, a message that said *I was here, I was real, I carried the bags and I didn't ask and this is where it ends*, and the message went unread every night by the boy who slept above it, the boy who was following the same path, step by step, bag by bag, into the same dark.

The building creaked. The rain had passed. The city hummed. And in the morning, the work phone would buzz with a new address, and Connor would dress and descend and collect a new bag and carry it without opening it to a new man in a new doorway, and the money would arrive in his account, and the machine would run, and the fear would dissolve in the daylight the way it always dissolved, the way it was designed to dissolve, the way it would keep dissolving right up until the moment when the fear was the only thing left and even the machine couldn't make it go away.

But that was later. Now there was sleep, and the towel, and the dark, and the building holding him the way buildings hold everyone who sleeps inside them -- gently, temporarily, without promise.
