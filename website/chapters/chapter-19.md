# Chapter 19: The Backpack

The backpack was red.

This was the first thing Connor noticed, and the noticing was significant because the sports bags had been black -- generic, anonymous, the kind of bag that dissolved into a crowd the way a raindrop dissolved into a puddle. The red backpack was different. It was a Deuter hiking pack, forty litres, the kind designed for multi-day treks, with a waist belt and chest strap and compression straps and the particular engineering that German outdoor brands applied to carrying loads over distance. It was also clearly not Connor's.

It was on the desk in Felix's room on the morning of Day 37. Beside it, Felix was standing with the posture of a man about to explain something complicated in simple terms.

"New delivery," Felix said. "Different from the usual."

Connor looked at the backpack. The backpack was full -- packed tight, the compression straps cinched, the zippers closed, the waist belt coiled and clipped. Whatever was inside had been arranged with the precision of someone who understood how to distribute weight in a hiking pack, the heavy items centred and close to the spine, the lighter items at the periphery.

"This goes to Sentul," Felix said. "Industrial area, north of the city. Address is in your work phone. Man named Ah Keat. He'll be at a warehouse -- I'll text you the description. The delivery is straightforward but the distance is longer than usual. Take a Grab there, walk the last two blocks. Ah Keat will meet you at the loading dock."

"Sentul." Connor hadn't been to Sentul. He knew it by reputation -- an area north of KL Sentral that was part industrial, part residential, the kind of neighbourhood that tourists didn't visit because there was nothing to visit, just warehouses and workshops and the working infrastructure that kept the city running.

"What's in it?" The question came out before the machine could intercept it, propelled by the backpack's colour, its size, its weight -- the sheer physical difference from the sports bags that had been his cargo for a month.

Felix looked at him. The look was the familiar one -- the half-second assessment, the recalibration, the smooth return to warmth. "Specialty electronics. Circuit boards, processors, high-value components. The backpack is better for this -- more padding, more protection. These are fragile items."

"Right."

"The payment is higher. RM800."

The number landed. RM800. Double the standard rate. The mathematics was clear and the mathematics was a message: the number was proportional to the risk, and the risk was proportional to the cargo, and the cargo was proportional to whatever was inside the red backpack that Felix had called specialty electronics with the same smooth conviction he'd called everything else phone components.

Connor reached for the backpack. He lifted it from the desk.

The weight was wrong.

Not in the way the sports bags had been wrong -- the subtle, almost-plausible wrongness of something slightly heavier than chargers and cables. This was a different wrongness. The backpack was heavy -- genuinely heavy, the weight of something dense and compressed, the weight pulling on his shoulder and arm with an insistence that demanded acknowledgement. He estimated seven kilograms. Maybe eight. The weight was distributed well -- centred, close to the spine, the work of someone who knew how to pack -- but the mass was there, unavoidable, physical, present.

Seven kilograms of circuit boards. Seven kilograms of processors. Seven kilograms of specialty electronics that required a forty-litre hiking backpack with compression straps and a waist belt and RM800 for an hour's work.

The machine ran. The machine produced: *Electronics are heavy. Circuit boards are dense. High-value components require careful packaging, which adds weight. The backpack is overengineered because the contents are fragile. Felix is paying more because the items are valuable, not because they're dangerous.*

The rationalisation was competent. It addressed the weight, the payment, the packaging. It provided an explanation that was internally consistent and externally plausible. But the rationalisation had a quality it hadn't had before -- a transparency, a thinness, the quality of a paint that's been applied too many times and has begun to crack, revealing the surface beneath.

Connor put the backpack on. Adjusted the straps. The waist belt sat on his hips and the chest strap crossed his sternum and the weight settled into the pack's frame, distributed, managed, but present -- always present, a constant physical reminder that what he was carrying was not the same as what he'd carried before.

"Be safe," Felix said. "The Sentul area can be rough. Stay on the main roads. Deliver, collect confirmation, come home."

Connor nodded. He walked to the door.

"Connor."

He turned.

"Don't open the backpack."

The instruction was the same as always. But this time Felix didn't smile when he said it. This time the words were delivered flat, without the warm packaging of a boss reminding an employee of procedure, without the casual ease that made the instruction sound reasonable. The instruction was delivered the way a command is delivered -- clean, direct, non-negotiable -- and the absence of the smile was its own communication, a signal that whatever was in the red backpack was different enough from whatever had been in the sports bags that Felix had abandoned the pretence of normality and replaced it with the raw mechanics of control.

"Wouldn't dream of it," Connor said.

---

The Grab to Sentul took forty minutes.

Connor sat in the back seat with the red backpack beside him, occupying the middle seat like a passenger, its bulk pressing against his thigh with a warmth that was not warmth but weight -- the dense, insistent weight of something that wanted to be acknowledged. The backpack was the colour of a warning. The colour of stop signs and fire extinguishers and the little flags that divers planted on the surface to say *something is happening below*. In the dim back seat of a silver Proton Saga, the red was muted, almost maroon, but it was still there, still wrong, still the colour of a thing that did not belong in a car with a pine-scented air freshener and a phone playing Waze directions in Bahasa Melayu.

The driver was a Malay man in his fifties, soft-faced, wearing a songkok and a button-down shirt that suggested another life -- a teacher, perhaps, or a government clerk moonlighting for Grab. He glanced at the backpack in his mirror. He glanced at Connor. The glance contained the calculation that all Grab drivers performed: assess the passenger, assess the cargo, decide whether to speak or drive in silence.

"Going to Sentul, ya?" he said. His English was careful, practiced, the English of a man who used it as a professional courtesy rather than a native instrument.

"Yeah."

"Business or visiting?"

The question was casual. The question was devastating. Connor said the thing that backpackers said when they didn't want to answer questions.

"Just checking out a different part of the city. Trying to see the real KL, you know?"

The driver smiled. "Sentul is real," he said. "Very real. Not many tourist there. You are the first *orang putih* I take to Sentul in a long time."

*Orang putih.* White person. Connor had heard the term before -- in markets, in hawker stalls, always at the edge of conversations he wasn't meant to understand. The term was not hostile. It was classificatory, and in Sentul, the category it assigned him -- *foreigner* -- would be visible in a way it was not in Bukit Bintang or Petaling Street, where white skin was part of the landscape, expected, catered to, absorbed.

The city changed as they moved north. The gleaming towers of the city centre -- KLCC, the Petronas Towers, the glass-and-steel monuments to Malaysia's ambition -- gave way as they turned onto Jalan Ipoh, the broad artery that ran north through the city's older body. The buildings lowered. The glass and steel surrendered to concrete and corrugated zinc. The pavements cracked. The traffic thickened with lorries and motorcycles, the heavy diesel machinery of a city's circulatory system, the vehicles that moved goods rather than people. Connor watched through the window and the watching was like watching a translation -- the same city, rendered in a different language, the tourist-facing version replaced by the version that existed when the tourists weren't looking.

He checked the GPS on the driver's phone. The blue dot was moving through streets he had never seen, into a territory that his mental map of KL -- bounded by Petaling Street to the south, KLCC to the east, Changkat to the west, the monorail to the north -- simply did not contain. He was off his map. He was in the white space at the edges, the part of the city where @ConnorGoesGlobal had never taken a photo because there was nothing to photograph, nothing that would generate engagement, nothing that would look good with a Valencia filter and a caption about discovering hidden gems.

The backpack sat beside him. Its weight had shifted during a turn, pressing harder against his thigh, and the pressure was a nudge, the physical equivalent of a hand on the shoulder saying *I'm still here, I'm still heavy, I'm still the thing you're pretending not to know about*.

Sentul was grey. Not uniformly grey -- there were patches of colour: a Hindu temple's painted tower rising from a row of workshops, its gopuram crowded with painted gods in blues and greens, a roti canai stall with a yellow awning where a man was stretching dough with the wrist-flick mastery of a lifetime's practice, a school playground where children in blue uniforms were running in the heat. But the dominant tone was industrial grey, the grey of concrete and steel and the flat, functional buildings that housed the machinery of commerce. This was a neighbourhood that existed for the verb *to work*, and the work was visible everywhere -- in the oil stains on the road, in the forklift tracks on the pavement, in the men in coveralls walking with the slow, deliberate gait of people who carried heavy things for a living.

"Here, ya?" The driver had pulled over on a wide, quiet street. Ahead, the road continued past warehouses with corrugated walls and loading docks.

Connor looked at the backpack. He looked at the street. He was two blocks from the warehouse, as instructed, and the instruction to walk the last two blocks was not about exercise or fresh air -- the instruction was about distance, about separation, about ensuring that no Grab driver's trip history showed a pickup or a dropoff at the exact address where a man named Ah Keat weighed things on a digital scale.

"Yeah. Here's good. Thanks."

He took the backpack. He opened the door. The heat hit him -- not the tourist-district heat modulated by air-conditioned malls and shaded walkways, but the raw heat of an industrial street, rising from asphalt and zinc and the exhaust of idling lorries. The air smelled of machine oil and hot metal and, beneath that, the faint sweet rot of tropical vegetation reclaiming the gaps between buildings.

Connor got out of the Grab two blocks from the warehouse, as instructed. The street was quiet -- no vendors, no tourists, no market stalls. Just warehouses and workshops and parked lorries and the smell of machine oil and hot metal. A stray dog trotted past on some private mission, its ribs visible under matted fur.

He walked. The backpack's weight was on his hips and shoulders and spine, and the weight was conversation, the weight was communication, the weight was the backpack saying *I am here and I am heavy and you know why I am heavy and you are choosing not to know*.

The warehouse was at the end of the street. A large building, single-storey, corrugated zinc walls, a loading dock with a metal roller door raised to half-height. Outside, a white van was parked at an angle, its rear doors open. A man was leaning against the van, smoking.

Ah Keat was approximately forty-five. Chinese-Malaysian. Short, stocky, his forearms thick and scarred, the build of someone who moved things for a living. He wore a white polo shirt stained with something dark, dark trousers, rubber-soled boots. His face was flat, unreadable, the face of a man who had optimised himself for function rather than expression.

He saw Connor approach. His eyes went to the backpack. He straightened from the van, dropped the cigarette, and ground it under his boot with the automatic precision of a man who ground out a hundred cigarettes a day.

"You're the Australian," he said. Not a question.

"Yeah. From Felix."

"Inside."

He ducked under the roller door and Connor followed. The warehouse interior was dim -- high ceiling, fluorescent tubes hanging from chains, only half of them lit. The space was large and mostly empty, the concrete floor stained with oil and scored by forklift tracks. Along one wall, metal shelving held boxes of various sizes. Along another, a workbench with tools, a lamp, and a large digital scale.

A scale. The same kind of scale Tomoko had photographed in Wei's shop. The flat metal platform, the LCD readout, the precision equipment of a person who measured things in grams.

Ah Keat held out his hand. Connor slipped the backpack off and handed it over. The weight transferred -- from his shoulders to Ah Keat's hands, from his responsibility to someone else's -- and the transfer produced a relief so intense it was almost physical, a lightness that made him feel briefly, absurdly, like he could float.

Ah Keat took the backpack to the workbench. He unzipped it with a single fluid motion, the sound of the zipper loud in the warehouse silence, the sound of something being opened that should not be opened in the presence of the person who had carried it. Connor was standing five metres away, near the roller door, and from five metres, in the dim light, with Ah Keat's body partially blocking the view, he could see the backpack's contents.

They were not circuit boards.

The contents were packages. Multiple packages, each one wrapped in layers of cling film, then sealed in vacuum bags, then wrapped again in something opaque -- plastic sheeting, black, taped shut. The packages were rectangular, flat, dense. Ah Keat removed them one by one and placed them on the workbench, and the placing was careful, methodical, the movements of a man handling material that required respect. His hands moved with the efficiency of repetition -- no hesitation, no fumbling, no wasted motion. He had done this before. He had done this a hundred times, perhaps a thousand, and the doing had been refined into a choreography, a set of movements as practised and automatic as a surgeon tying sutures or a mechanic changing spark plugs.

Seven packages. Each one approximately the size of a paperback novel. Each one sealed, wrapped, anonymous.

The fluorescent light above the workbench hummed at a frequency that was almost too low to hear, a vibration that lived in the teeth and the sinuses. The light cast everything in the flat, shadowless pallor of an operating theatre -- every surface rendered in clinical detail, every edge sharp, every colour drained to its institutional version. Under that light, the packages looked medical. The vacuum seal looked sterile. The cling film caught the fluorescence and threw it back in small, sharp gleams, and the gleams were like the flash of instruments, the glint of things designed to cut or measure or quantify.

Ah Keat placed one on the scale. The LCD display flickered and resolved. Connor was five metres away. The display was small. The numbers were not fully visible.

But the gesture was visible. The weighing was visible. The scale, the packages, the careful handling, the vacuum seal, the multiple layers of wrapping designed to contain something that could not be contained by brown paper and tape -- all of it was visible, present, undeniable, the accumulated evidence of every suspicion he'd suppressed and every question he'd refused to ask.

Connor watched. His hands were at his sides and his hands were doing something he had not authorised -- his right hand was opening and closing, the fingers curling into the palm and releasing, curling and releasing, the unconscious rhythm of a body trying to discharge the electricity that the mind refused to acknowledge. His breathing had changed. He could hear it -- the shallow, too-fast breathing of an animal in the presence of a predator, the breathing that said *run* in a language older than thought. He did not run. He stood. He breathed. He watched Ah Keat place the second package on the scale and note the number and place the third package and note the number, and each placement was a sentence in a language Connor understood but would not translate, a language that spoke in grams and vacuum seals and the precise, clinical movements of a man who weighed things that could not legally be weighed.

He almost spoke. The word was rising in his throat -- not a specific word but the precursor to a word, the gathering of breath and intention that preceded speech, the moment before the moment of asking *what is that* or *what am I carrying* or simply *what*. The word gathered. The word rose. And the machine intercepted it -- not gently, not with the smooth rationalisation of the early weeks, but violently, desperately, the way a hand clamps over a mouth, the way a door slams shut on something that must not be let in. The machine killed the word before it reached his lips and replaced it with silence, and the silence was louder than any word would have been, the silence of a man who had chosen not to ask because the answer was already inside him, fully formed, waiting in the dark.

Connor's mind was running -- not the machine, not the rationalisation engine, but the other mind, the deeper one, the one that processed information before the conscious mind could edit it. The deeper mind was assembling the evidence: the scale, the packages, the wrapping, the weight, the payment (RM800 for an hour's work), the location (a warehouse in an industrial area), the contact (a man who didn't smile, who didn't talk, who weighed things on a digital scale).

The deeper mind reached a conclusion. The conclusion was a word. The word was *drugs*.

The machine intercepted. The machine ran. The machine produced: *You don't know what those packages contain. They could be specialty electronics. They could be high-value components that require vacuum sealing for moisture protection. Circuit boards are sensitive to humidity. The scale could be measuring the total weight for shipping purposes. You're five metres away and you can't see the display and you're making assumptions based on packaging and Ah Keat's demeanour and your own paranoia.*

The rationalisation worked. Not completely -- a crack remained, a fissure in the wall, a space through which the truth leaked like water through a dam. But the wall held. The wall had been built by a master craftsman -- twenty-seven years of practised denial, of looking away, of choosing the comfortable interpretation over the accurate one -- and the wall could hold a crack. The wall could hold many cracks. The wall could hold until the moment when the water pressure exceeded the wall's capacity, and then the wall would break, and the breaking would be the end.

Ah Keat finished. He rezipped the backpack, empty now except for the padding, and handed it back to Connor. The backpack was light -- featherweight, impossibly light after the walk here, the absence of the weight producing a vertigo, a sensation of something missing.

"Done," Ah Keat said.

Connor took the backpack. He walked out of the warehouse. The sunlight hit him like a wall. The stray dog was still there, lying in the shade of a lorry, its ribs moving with the slow breathing of an animal that had accepted its conditions.

His work phone buzzed: RM800 transferred.

He walked to the main road. He flagged a Grab. The wait was seven minutes. He stood on the pavement with the empty backpack hanging from one hand, and the emptiness was its own sensation -- a lightness that was not relief but vertigo, the weightlessness of a thing removed, the phantom ache of an amputation. His shoulder still carried the memory of the weight, the muscles still braced for seven kilograms that were no longer there, and the absence of the weight was worse than the weight had been, because the weight had been a question and the absence was an answer, and the answer was that he had carried something to a warehouse and a man had taken it and weighed it in grams and the something was now gone and the grams were now known and the transaction was complete and Connor was standing on a pavement in Sentul holding a red backpack that contained nothing but the ghost of what it had contained.

The Grab arrived. Another silver Proton, another anonymous back seat, another driver who did not speak. Connor sat with the backpack on his lap, his arms around it, and watched the city translate itself back -- the warehouses giving way to shops, the shops to signboards in Mandarin and Tamil, the roads widening, the traffic shifting from lorries to sedans. The city reversed. The industrial grey dissolved into the commercial colour of Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the sari shops and electronics stores, and then they were crossing the river and the KLCC skyline was ahead, the Petronas Towers rising above everything like a pair of chrome exclamation marks, and the towers were a signal, a geographic reset, a declaration that he was back in the version of KL that he knew, the version that was legible and navigable and safe.

His phone buzzed. Not the work phone -- the real phone, the Connor phone, the phone that connected to @ConnorGoesGlobal and the 4,200 followers who believed he was living the dream. An Instagram notification: someone had liked a photo he'd posted three days ago, a sunset from the hostel rooftop, the Petronas Towers backlit in orange and violet, the caption reading *Golden hour in KL. This city never gets old.* The photo had forty-seven likes. The photo was beautiful. The photo was a lie -- not in its composition but in its implication, which was that the man who took it was a man whose life was sunsets and rooftops and the uncomplicated beauty of a city seen from above. The man who took that photo did not carry red backpacks to warehouses. The man who took that photo did not watch men weigh packages on digital scales. The man who took that photo existed on a screen, in a curated gallery of a life that was increasingly fictional, and the distance between that man and the man sitting in the back of a Grab with an empty backpack on his lap was a distance that could not be measured in kilometres or ringgit but only in the specific, corrosive unit of self-knowledge that Connor had spent five weeks refusing to acquire.

He closed Instagram. He put the phone in his pocket.

He thought about the packages on the workbench. The vacuum seal. The scale. The weighing.

*Specialty electronics,* the machine said. *High-value components. Moisture-sensitive circuit boards.*

The machine said it. Connor heard it. The machine was still running but the machine was tired, the gears grinding, the output thinner, the product less convincing. The machine had been running for five weeks and the fuel was running low and the cracks were multiplying and the water pressure was building and the wall was holding but the wall was not as strong as it had been, not as thick, not as sure.

He went home. He showered. He stood under the cold water in the second-floor bathroom -- the bathroom with the cracked tiles and the showerhead that delivered water in an uneven, pulsing stream, the bathroom where someone had scratched @HostelReaper into the grout between the tiles near the drain -- and felt the water on his skin and let it run over his face and his shoulders and down the body that had carried the backpack to Sentul and back. The water was cold. The cold was supposed to be a cleansing, a reset, the physical equivalent of pressing delete, but the water only cleaned the skin and the thing that needed cleaning was not on the skin. The thing that needed cleaning was behind the wall, behind the cracks, in the place where the deeper mind had assembled the evidence and reached the conclusion and been silenced by the machine, and no amount of cold water from a hostel showerhead would reach that place.

He stood under the water until the cold stopped feeling cold and started feeling like nothing, the sensation flattening into numbness that was almost peace. Then he thought about seven kilograms and RM800 and a scale in a warehouse, and the numbness broke, and the water was cold again.

He thought about Priya's words: *You're not trapped. You're choosing.*

He thought about Jake, on a beach in Langkawi, drinking duty-free beer, the most dangerous thing in his day a sunburn.

He thought about his father: *The rules don't care who you are.*

He thought about David's brother, in Kajang Prison, counting days.

He thought about the word *drugs* and the wall that held it back and the cracks in the wall and the water behind the cracks.

He turned off the shower. He dried himself with the blue Sea to Summit towel -- the towel that had been with him through twelve countries, that smelled of every place he'd been, that would be with him at the end. He hung the towel on the hook behind the bathroom door and went to his dorm and lay on Bed 7 and stared at the ceiling and did not sleep.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The building breathed.

And in a warehouse in Sentul, a man named Ah Keat was weighing the last of seven packages on a digital scale, and the scale's LCD display read a number, and the number was in grams, and the total across all seven packages was a number that Connor would never know but that the Malaysian legal system would eventually quantify with the precision and the finality that the law brought to all quantification, the law that didn't distinguish and didn't forgive and didn't care who you were or where you came from or how many countries your towel had been to.

The number was enough.

The number was more than enough.
