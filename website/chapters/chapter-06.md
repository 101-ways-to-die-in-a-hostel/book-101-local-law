# Chapter 6: The Envelope

Felix found him in the common room at half nine in the morning, which was early for Felix and obscene for Connor. The German was showered, shaved, and wearing a fresh linen shirt the colour of cream, looking less like a man who lived in a backpacker hostel and more like a man who had stepped out of a cologne advertisement to temporarily grace one with his presence. He was carrying two coffees from somewhere outside -- not the instant Nescafe that the hostel kitchen offered in a jar with a rusted lid, but real coffee, in paper cups with sleeves and lids and a logo that looked expensive. Felix always had good coffee. Felix always had good everything.

Connor was on the corduroy sofa, horizontal, one arm draped over his eyes. He was wearing the board shorts he'd slept in and a singlet with a faded Corona logo that had been through enough wash cycles to achieve a transparency that bordered on the conceptual. His phone was on his chest, playing a podcast about cryptocurrency investing he wasn't listening to.

"Morning," Felix said, and placed one of the coffees on the jigsaw table. The jigsaw had not progressed since Connor's arrival. The Petronas Towers remained headless.

Connor peeled his arm from his face and squinted up. "What time is it?"

"Nine-thirty."

"Jesus." He sat up, rubbed his face, and reached for the coffee. Flat white. Perfect. The caffeine began its repair work on the damage done by last night's beers -- four Tigers on the rooftop with Jake, followed by two rum-and-Cokes at a karaoke bar on Changkat where a group of Korean tourists had performed a genuinely moving rendition of "Bohemian Rhapsody."

"You're a legend," Connor said, meaning the coffee, meaning Felix, meaning the simple fact that someone in this city knew what he wanted before he did.

Felix sat in the armchair opposite, arranging himself with his usual studied ease. "How's the bank account?"

Connor's jaw worked. Seven hundred and twelve ringgit. Roughly two hundred and thirty Australian dollars. His parents' monthly deposit wasn't due for another eight days. He could survive on hostel noodles and free toast, but surviving wasn't the point. You couldn't curate the digital nomad life on seven hundred ringgit.

"It's fine," Connor said, because he said this about everything.

"I have something for you."

Felix reached into his canvas messenger bag and produced a Manila envelope. Standard size. Sealed. The kind of envelope you'd see in any office -- the universal container of boring adult things. He placed it on the jigsaw table.

"What's that?"

"A favour. A small one. Twenty minutes, maybe."

Connor picked it up. Light -- the weight of a few sheets of paper. He turned it over. No markings. The seal was firm, gummed flap and brass clasp.

"I do some work for an import-export company," Felix said. "Photography, mostly -- product shots for their catalogue. Boring stuff, but it pays. They need these documents delivered to one of their associates. Physical copies. Their courier service in KL is --" he grinned -- "*scheisse*. Unreliable. These are contracts, invoices, sensitive business documents. They need a human being to walk them from A to B."

"Why can't you do it?" Connor asked, and later -- much later -- he would recognise this as the only sensible question he'd asked in the entire conversation, and how easily Felix had navigated around it.

"I have a meeting. A gallery in Bangsar wants to exhibit some of my Malaysia series. The meeting is at eleven and I can't be in Bukit Bintang and Bangsar at the same time."

It made sense. That was the thing about Felix's explanations -- they always made sense. Not the aggressive sense of a lie trying too hard, but the easy sense of a truth that had nothing to prove.

"Two hundred ringgit," Felix said. "For twenty minutes of walking."

Connor did the math. Not the real math -- not *why would anyone pay two hundred ringgit for a twenty-minute walk*, or *what kind of business documents can't be emailed*. He did the other math. Two hundred ringgit was almost a third of his remaining funds, materialised from thin air. Four nights at the hostel. Ten plates of Mama Siti's nasi lemak. The difference between anxiety and comfort.

"Where am I going?"

"A cafe in Bukit Bintang. Brickhouse -- exposed brick, minimalist, charges fifteen ringgit for a flat white." He smiled. "You'll meet a man sitting alone. Blue polo shirt, reading a newspaper. Hand him the envelope. He won't say much. I'll send the money via GrabPay as soon as you confirm."

"That's it?"

"That's it."

Connor turned the envelope over. His thumb found the seal. He could open it. The thought arrived and departed in the same instant, the way a fish surfaces and vanishes -- visible for a fraction of a second, gone before the brain can form the word *fish*. He could open the envelope and make an informed decision about carrying it across the city for a man he'd known for six days, in a country where the drug laws were printed in red on signs the size of doors.

Connor did not open the envelope.

"One thing," Felix said, his voice shifting by a degree -- not colder, just more precise. "Don't open it. Sensitive business documents -- invoices, client details. Confidentiality is a big deal. If the seal is broken, they won't accept delivery and neither of us gets paid."

"Easy as," Connor said.

He put the envelope in the back pocket of his board shorts. Felix finished his coffee, stood, and adjusted his messenger bag.

"Text me when it's done." At the archway, he paused. "And Connor? Thanks, mate."

He said *mate* with the German accent, the *a* wider and flatter than an Australian would make it, and this small linguistic mimicry made the whole thing feel like a favour between friends.

Felix's footsteps climbed the narrow staircase -- the third step from the top squeaked -- and his door opened and closed with a soft click.

Connor sat in the common room with the envelope in his pocket and the morning light falling through the air well onto the mosaic tiles. From the kitchen, the clatter of Mama Siti's pans. The smell of coconut rice and sambal. He finished his coffee, checked his phone -- 10:07 -- and walked out into the heat.

---

The walk from Chinatown to Bukit Bintang was a transit through layers of Kuala Lumpur, each one thinner and more polished than the last, as if the city were shedding its history block by block and emerging into something chrome and air-conditioned and new.

Connor stepped out of the hostel's narrow door -- the phone repair shop on his left humming its fluorescent hum, the Chinese medicine store on his right dark and aromatic -- and into the late-morning chaos of Petaling Street. The market was in full throat: vendors unfolding trestle tables, hanging counterfeit handbags from wire frames, stacking bootleg sneakers in their boxes. A man was grilling satay over a portable charcoal grill, the smoke rising in a column that caught the light and turned it amber. Cantonese clattered above the traffic noise. A motorbike threaded through the pedestrian flow with the casual disregard for physics that Malaysian motorbikes treated as a religious principle.

He filmed, of course. Phone up, one-handed grip, low confessional voice.

"Morning walk through KL. Chinatown first thing -- the energy here is unreal. No itinerary, just stepping out the door and letting the city happen to you."

He turned the camera on himself. Grin. The market a blur behind him.

"Day six in Malaysia. Six days of no plan and everything's working out."

Past the Guan Di Temple, its red facade glowing like an ember, joss stick smoke curling from the open door. Past the dried goods shops and the old men playing Chinese chess on an upturned crate. Jalan Sultan widened. Shophouses gave way to commercial buildings. A 7-Eleven. A bank. Traffic thickened in a three-way negotiation that Connor couldn't parse but which never resulted in collision.

The humidity was building toward its daily crescendo. Connor's singlet darkened between his shoulder blades. His Havaianas slapped against the pavement. The envelope sat in his back pocket. He didn't think about it. He thought about the money, about extending his stay, about buying Priya dinner at that place Jake had mentioned on Jalan Alor.

He passed a police officer.

The officer was standing on the corner of Jalan Sultan and Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, a young Malay man in the light blue uniform of the Polis Diraja Malaysia, his cap pulled low against the sun, a walkie-talkie crackling on his hip. He was watching the traffic with the practised boredom of a man on a routine post. Connor walked past him -- two meters from a uniformed officer, a sealed envelope of unverified contents in his back pocket, given to him by a man he'd known for six days, to be delivered to a stranger across the city. He felt nothing. No spike of adrenaline, no flutter of conscience, no whisper of *maybe you should think about what you're doing*. He was carrying business documents. Boring stuff. A mate's favour.

He was invisible in the way that privilege makes you invisible -- not hidden, but beneath notice, unworthy of suspicion, because people who looked like Connor didn't do things that warranted suspicion. That was for other people. Connor knew this without knowing it, the way a fish knows water -- it was the medium he moved through, and he had never once been asked to name it.

Jalan Sultan became Jalan Bukit Bintang by degrees. Shophouses vanished. Glass-fronted malls appeared -- Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, the same brands in every city. The sidewalks widened. He stopped filming. Modernity didn't play well on Instagram. Nobody double-tapped a Zara storefront.

He followed Felix's directions: past the intersection, left at the Starbucks, down a side street of gentrified shophouses -- a barber shop with exposed bulbs, a boutique selling "curated" handicrafts, a yoga studio. And there: Brickhouse Cafe.

It was exactly the kind of place Felix had described. Exposed brick walls -- the original shophouse brickwork, cleaned and sealed and turned from functional material into aesthetic statement. Blonde wood tables, black metal chairs, the kind of Scandinavian-Japanese hybrid aesthetic Connor had seen in a hundred cafes across Southeast Asia. An enormous Italian coffee machine gleamed like a surgical instrument behind the counter. The menu was written in chalk: *Flat White RM15. Pour Over RM18. Matcha Latte RM16.* A single monstera plant in a ceramic pot guarded the entrance.

Air conditioning hit him like a wall of cold, the sudden shift from tropical humidity to controlled coolness that was, in its way, as much a feature of KL as the heat itself.

The cafe was half-full. A young woman with a laptop and the focused expression of someone meeting a deadline. Two men in business shirts having a meeting over espressos. A mother with a toddler in a highchair, the toddler systematically disassembling a croissant. And at the back, alone, reading a newspaper, wearing a blue polo shirt: the man.

Malaysian, maybe Chinese-Malaysian. Middle-aged. Nondescript. The kind of face you'd forget before you'd finished looking at it. His newspaper was the *New Straits Times*, folded to the business section. He read with the absorption of a man who had been told to look like he was reading.

Connor approached. "Hey, mate. I've got something from Felix."

The man looked up. His eyes met Connor's for a fraction of a second, then swept the cafe -- door, windows, other customers. Then his eyes dropped to Connor's chest -- specifically the area where a wire might be taped -- then to the envelope Connor was pulling from his pocket.

He did not speak. He did not smile. He reached out and took the envelope with a motion closer to extraction than acceptance, his fingers closing around it in a single fluid movement.

The envelope disappeared below the table. The soft tear of the clasp opening. Rustle of paper. Silence. The man's eyes were lowered, his face a mask of professional blankness, his hands invisible beneath the tabletop.

"So... we're good?" Connor said.

The man nodded once. A single, minimal dip of the chin. There was nothing in his eyes. Not hostility, not warmth. The eyes of a man who had trained himself to be a surface with nothing behind it.

Connor got the social cue -- the conversation was over -- without getting the actual hint: normal business associates make eye contact. They say hello. They do not scan rooms for surveillance before accepting envelopes, and they do not open them under tables. These were not the behaviours of a man receiving invoices.

Connor noticed none of this. He noticed that the man was rude, and that the cafe had good natural light.

"Right. Cool."

He walked out. Three steps along the pavement. His phone buzzed. GrabPay: *You have received RM200.00 from F. Decker.*

The hit was immediate and chemical, a flush of warmth that started in his chest and radiated outward to his extremities. It was not unlike the feeling of the first beer of the day, or the feeling of a post getting more likes than expected, or the feeling of a pretty girl laughing at something he'd said. It was the feeling of the world confirming that you were doing it right, that your instincts were correct, that the approach of just going with it and saying yes and not overthinking things was, in fact, the superior way to live. Two hundred ringgit for twenty minutes of walking. The hourly rate was -- Connor calculated with the only mathematics he respected -- approximately six hundred ringgit per hour, which was more than most people in this city earned in a day, and he'd earned it by putting one foot in front of the other.

He grinned. He grinned at the street, at the shopping malls, at the taxis lined up outside Lot 10, at a pair of girls in hijabs who walked past and did not grin back.

He texted Felix: *Done. Smooth as. Cheers legend.*

Felix's reply came within thirty seconds: *Perfect. Told you - easy money. Enjoy your day.*

---

He stopped at a street stall two blocks from the hostel and ordered a teh tarik. The stall was one of his discoveries -- a narrow counter under a zinc awning, run by an Indian-Malaysian man in his sixties who made pulled tea with the theatrical flair of a bartender and the precision of a chemist. The man held two metal cups at arm's length -- one high, one low -- and poured the milky tea between them in a long, frothy arc, the liquid streaming down in a golden rope that never broke, never splashed. It was a performance. It was a skill refined over decades. It was exactly the kind of thing Connor would have filmed if he hadn't already filmed it twice.

The teh tarik was sweet and milky and perfect. Connor drank it standing at the counter, two hundred ringgit richer, savouring not just the money but the sense of capability -- that he, Connor Briggs, had a skill the world would pay for. Granted, the skill was walking, but still. Felix had needed someone reliable. Felix had chosen him. There was something flattering in that, something that confirmed what Connor had always believed about himself: that he was a person who attracted opportunity because he was open to it in a way that planners and worriers simply weren't.

He left a five-ringgit note on the counter -- a generous tip, the generosity of the newly flush -- and walked back to the hostel.

The common room was occupied. Jake was sprawled on the corduroy sofa like a golden retriever that had been asked to sit and had interpreted the instruction liberally. He was wearing a backwards cap, a Quiksilver T-shirt, eating a banana, and watching surfing wipeouts on his phone without headphones.

"Dude! Where you been?"

Connor dropped into the armchair. "Side hustle," he said, and grinned. He was already constructing the narrative -- converting the morning into anecdote, shaping experience into content, which was what he did with everything. "You know that import-export company Felix does photography for? They needed someone to run some documents across town. Business papers, contracts, that kind of thing. Twenty minutes of walking. Two hundred ringgit."

Jake's eyebrows rose above the frame of his sunglasses, which were perched on his forehead despite being indoors. "Dude. Two hundred ringgit for *walking*? That's sick."

"For walking."

"That's like fifty bucks for doing nothing."

"Right?" Connor leaned back. The armchair smelled of dust and Tiger Balm and the collective exhaustion of a thousand backpackers. "Felix reckons there might be more. Regular thing."

"You're, like, living the dream, man. Side hustle in KL. That's content right there. You should post about it."

Connor considered this. An Instagram story: *Making money while making memories. The digital nomad life isn't just laptops and lattes. #sidehustle #KLlife #makingitwork.* He could see the likes accumulating, the comments from people back home who worked nine-to-five and scrolled through his feed thinking *how does he afford this?* Now he'd have an answer.

Neither of them heard the footsteps. Neither noticed Priya until she was already there, standing in the archway, her battered Lonely Planet under one arm, her round glasses pushed up her nose, her hair in its single long braid. She had heard the last two minutes.

"What kind of company?" she asked.

Connor straightened. He liked Priya. More than liked. She was smart and sharp and looked at him like she could see something in him that he couldn't see himself.

"Import-export. Photography equipment, I think. Felix's thing."

Her expression changed in a way Connor didn't have the resolution to detect -- a tightening at the corners of her mouth, the face of a fourth-year medical student registering a symptom. She held it for half a second.

"Hm. Right." She pushed her glasses up. "What were you delivering?"

"An envelope. Business documents. Invoices, contracts, boring stuff."

"Did you look at them?"

"Nah, they're sealed. Confidential."

Priya looked at Connor for a long moment. Then at Jake, who wasn't looking at either of them. Then at the floor.

"Be careful," she said.

"Of what?" Connor laughed -- his reflex against seriousness. "It's an envelope, Priya. Business papers. Felix is a mate."

"You've known him for six days."

"And they've been a great six days." The grin was a wall, and behind it, nothing. "Relax. It's all good."

Priya said "Okay" in a voice that communicated the opposite, and walked out the front door into Petaling Street.

Connor watched her go. He felt something -- not guilt, not concern, but a vague irritation, the itchy displeasure that arrived whenever someone introduced friction into the smooth narrative of his life. Priya was doing the thing that careful people did: worrying about things that didn't need worrying about. She was a planner. A Googler. A reader of guidebooks and fine print. He liked her, genuinely, but sometimes being around her was like wearing a seatbelt in a parked car. Necessary, she'd argue. Unnecessary, he'd counter. And he was right. He was always right about these things.

"She's cool," Jake said, not looking up. "Kind of intense though."

"She's great," Connor said, and went upstairs.

---

Dorm 3 was empty except for the ceiling fan, which turned with patient indifference, and the smell of old wood and damp cotton. The afternoon light came through the air well in a shaft of grey-white -- clouds gathering for the daily storm.

Connor climbed into Bed 7. The mattress squeaked. He lay on his back, scrolled Instagram, liked photos, the mechanical rhythm soothing in its mindlessness. He was buzzing with the teh tarik and the two hundred ringgit and the residual irritation from Priya's concern.

A noise in the doorway.

Aziz was standing at the entrance to Dorm 3, filling the frame the way a boulder fills a streambed -- wide shoulders touching both sides of the doorway, the air rerouting around him. He was holding a toolbox and a replacement motor for the ceiling fan, and he was looking at Connor.

In six days, Connor had heard Aziz say exactly four words: "Fan. Tomorrow. Morning." and, on a separate occasion, "No." He was in his fifties, broad-shouldered, with the kind of forearms that suggested a lifetime of physical work and the kind of eyes that suggested a lifetime of things he'd rather not have seen. He chain-smoked Gudang Garam kretek cigarettes in the alley. He fixed things. He checked IDs. He was, in Connor's taxonomy, a background character.

But Aziz was looking at him now with an expression that was something closer to grief -- the look of a person watching a thing happen that they have seen happen before and will see happen again and cannot stop.

Aziz set down his toolbox. He set down the motor. He stood in the doorway and opened his mouth.

The silence that followed was not empty. It was full of the words Aziz was not saying, words he had said once before in a different life and the saying of which had cost him his badge, his pension, his marriage, and very nearly his life. *I know what the envelope was. I know who Felix is. I have seen this play out before, with someone who slept in that exact bed, and she is in prison now.* The words were behind his teeth. He could feel them the way you feel a sneeze building.

Aziz's jaw worked. The muscles in his face shifted, rearranged, settled.

He had been a police officer once. Twenty-two years with the Polis Diraja Malaysia, twelve as a narcotics detective. He had been good at it. He had, on one occasion in 2014, followed the evidence to a place his superiors didn't want him to go and filed a report about connections between a trafficking ring and certain officers. The report had ended his career. Not violently -- just a transfer, then a redundancy, then a pension that evaporated in an administrative error never corrected. His wife left six months later. Aziz had taken the handyman job because Razak was his cousin and because the building needed things fixed and because speaking up was a luxury for people with nothing to lose, and he had discovered, too late, that he had everything to lose.

He had watched Lena. The Swedish girl. Bed 7. He had watched her carry envelopes, then packages, then a backpack. He had watched Felix build around her the same architecture closing now around Connor. He had said nothing, and Lena was in Kajang Prison, and Aziz fixed ceiling fans and smoked kretek cigarettes in the alley and said nothing.

He closed his mouth.

He picked up his toolbox. Picked up the motor. Stood in the doorway one more second, his eyes meeting Connor's -- a transmission of something not quite information, a frequency of human distress that required, on the receiver's part, a sensitivity Connor did not possess.

"You right, mate?" Connor said.

Aziz turned and walked down the corridor. His footsteps receded -- the third step from the top squeaked -- and then he was gone.

Connor shrugged. The physical gesture, shoulders up and down, a one-second dismissal. A weird bloke having a weird moment. Hostel people. You got all types.

He opened Instagram.

---

The storm came at 2:14 PM, as it always did, with a rumble of thunder that vibrated through the old building's bones and then the sudden, percussive fury of tropical rain on zinc roofs and tile courtyards and the open throat of the air well. The dorm darkened. The air cooled. Connor spent the afternoon in the common room -- the storm had driven the hostel's population inside, filling the space with the restless, stir-crazy energy of travellers trapped by weather. The French couple were there, and the guitar player who had located a fourth string. Jake was teaching a Japanese girl a card game he was inventing as he went. Mama Siti shuffled through the kitchen and produced a pot of curry that filled the ground floor with the smell of turmeric and coconut milk and lemongrass.

Connor ate the curry. He ate seconds. He told Mama Siti it was "insane, restaurant-quality," and she looked at him with the expression of a woman who had been cooking since before he was born and did not require his assessment. He posted a photo to his stories: *When the hostel cook is better than any restaurant in the city. #KLfood #hostellife.*

When Priya came back from the Islamic Arts Museum, she showed him photos on her phone -- geometric patterns, illuminated manuscripts, ceramic tiles in shades of blue. He listened. He asked questions. She was surprised. He was surprised by himself. For twenty minutes on the bench by the air well they talked about art and the weight of time, and Connor was, for those twenty minutes, a better version of himself -- curious, attentive, almost wise. It didn't last. It couldn't. But Priya saw it, and filed it in the part of her mind where she kept the evidence that Connor might be worth saving.

Night. The hostel quieted. The rooftop drinkers drank. The snorers snored. The ceiling fan turned.

He was in his bunk, Bed 7, Dorm 3. The room was dark except for the blue-white glow of phone screens -- the universal nightlight of the modern hostel, the scattered constellations of people lying in the dark, connected to everywhere except where they were. Someone above him watching a video, the volume barely audible -- a woman's voice, Korean, rhythmic and soothing. A gentle snore across the room. The air well letting in the city's deep-night sounds -- a motorbike, a cat, the long low moan of a cargo truck on Jalan Sultan.

Connor was scrolling. He'd posted the photo from his walk -- the KL skyline, slightly blurred in a way he'd decided was "intentional." Filter to deepen the shadows, add grain. The caption had taken twelve minutes:

*The city reveals itself to those who walk it. No map. No destination. Just motion and the faith that the next corner holds something worth seeing. #KL #kualalumpur #digitalnomad #streetphotography #noplan #livingmybestlife #malaysia*

Forty-seven likes. His mother: *Love this! Dad says hi xx.* A girl from Chiang Mai: *Omg KL is on my list!* A bot offering collab opportunities.

He rolled onto his side. The bunk creaked. His hand slid off the mattress and brushed the wooden frame -- dark, old wood, warm from the room's trapped heat. His fingers trailed along the surface, idle, sensing without seeking.

His fingertips found the grooves.

Letters. Carved small and shallow, someone pressing a point into the grain, letter by letter. The grooves were smooth with age. His fingers passed over them, reading the name in Braille, in the dark, without his eyes.

L. E. N. A.

If he turned on his phone flashlight and looked, he would see it. If he asked, someone might tell him about the Swedish girl who'd slept in this bed, who'd met a charming European man in the common room, who was now in Kajang Prison, four hundred and seven days into a wait for a trial that would almost certainly end with a judge pronouncing the words *gantung sampai mati* -- hanged until dead.

But Connor did not look. His hand was already back under his pillow, his eyes already closing, and the name was already forgotten -- not forgotten, because it had never been known. It was a texture. A roughness in wood. An imperfection he slept against every night and had never examined, because examining things was not what Connor did.

---

His phone screen lit up.

White light cutting through the dark. Connor's eyes opened. His thumb unlocked the screen before his brain had surfaced from sleep.

A text from Felix. 12:47 AM.

*See? Easy. Got another one tomorrow if you're keen. Same deal.*

Connor read the message. *See? Easy.* Yes. *Got another one tomorrow.* Another envelope. Another walk. Another two hundred ringgit. *If you're keen.* If. As if there were a version of Connor who would think *I'd like to know what I'm carrying and who I'm carrying it to and why a man I've known for six days is paying me to do something he could do himself*. As if there were a version of Connor who would lie in the dark and think, really think, about what it means when someone pays you not to ask questions.

His thumb hovered over the keyboard. The cursor blinked. The dorm was silent except for the breathing of seven people and the fan and the rain on the air well -- the particular, charged quiet of a moment that is, though the person living it does not know, a hinge.

Connor typed four letters.

*Keen.*

He sent it without thinking. Because why wouldn't he? It was just envelopes. It was just paper. Easy money in a city where money was the difference between the life he was living and the life he was afraid of. She'll be right. She'll always be right. Tomorrow another envelope, another walk, another two hundred ringgit, each one just as easy and just as harmless and just as light in his back pocket.

He put the phone face-down on the mattress. The screen went dark.

Connor closed his eyes. In two minutes he was asleep.

In the wooden frame of Bed 7, four letters held their shape in the dark, and the name they spelled belonged to a woman who had typed the same word -- *keen* -- on the same bed, to the same man, thirteen months ago, and who was now in a cell three hours south of this city, counting the days until a judge decided whether she would live or die.

The ceiling fan turned.

The rain fell.

The city did not care.
