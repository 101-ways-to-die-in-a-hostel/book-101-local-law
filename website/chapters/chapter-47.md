# Chapter 47: The Reckoning

Razak closed the hostel on a Wednesday.

He stood in the common room at 7 AM and watched the last guests leave -- a Korean couple who had seen the police tape and the forensic team and the headlines on their phones. They paid in cash and left without speaking, their rolling suitcases bumping down the narrow staircase. The bell rang once and settled.

Silence. Forty-two empty beds in six rooms on three floors. A kitchen without a cook -- Mama Siti had not come in since the news broke. The sambal pot was clean, upside down on the drying rack.

Razak climbed the staircase to Dorm 3. The room had been stripped by the forensic team, the mattresses bare. Bed 7 was in the far corner, bottom bunk, against the wall. The towel was gone -- sealed in an evidence bag at Dang Wangi, transformed from an object of comfort into an object of law.

Names were scratched into the bed frame. LENA, in thin, precise letters -- the Swedish girl who had slept here and been recruited here and was now in Kajang Prison. Below LENA, other names: TOM. JULIE. HANS. Connor's name was not scratched into the bed. Connor had not left a mark on the wood. The bed did not remember Connor. The bed was a bed.

Razak descended to his office. The newspaper clippings covered the walls. The map with its red pins hung above the desk, each pin marking a hostel where someone had died. There was a new pin. Kuala Lumpur. The Lantern Hostel. This pin was different from the others. The others marked deaths he had read about. This pin marked a death that had happened in his building, facilitated by his silence, enabled by his arrangement with a network he had tolerated because tolerance was easier than resistance.

"I'm sorry," he said to the map.

He locked the front door and pocketed the key. The red lanterns stayed on -- the lanterns were on a separate circuit that Razak had never turned off. He walked down Petaling Street toward Pasar Seni while the hostel behind him sat empty and the lanterns glowed for no one.

Ahmad interviewed Wei at the remand centre at Sungai Buloh.

The interview room was standard -- a table bolted to the floor, two chairs on each side, a camera in the corner, fluorescent lighting. The room was designed for function, not comfort: a space in which information was exchanged under conditions of asymmetric power, the interviewer holding the authority and the interviewee holding the information and the exchange requiring the careful calibration of pressure and release that was the art of interrogation.

Wei sat on the far side of the table. He was smaller than Ahmad had expected -- a thin man, early forties, Malaysian-Chinese, with the careful posture of a person who had spent his life in rooms where precision mattered. His hands were on the table, palms down, the fingers long and fine-boned, the hands of a technician. The hands that had assembled the packages. The hands that had sealed the methamphetamine in vacuum bags and placed the bags in charger boxes and backpack linings and suitcase walls. The hands were still now. The hands were on a table in an interview room and the stillness of the hands was the stillness of a man who was calculating the cost of every word he was about to speak.

Wei's lawyer sat beside him. Encik Ibrahim, a criminal defence lawyer from a firm on Jalan Sultan Ismail, retained by the network. The lawyer was there because the network's protocol included legal representation for arrested operatives -- the protocol recognising that legal representation was not a gesture of care for the operative but a mechanism of control, the lawyer's function not to defend the client but to manage the information that the client disclosed, to ensure that the client's cooperation served the client's survival without endangering the network's infrastructure.

But the lawyer's calculation had changed. The lawyer had reviewed the evidence. The lawyer had seen the CCTV footage that Tomoko's photographs had led Ahmad's team to subpoena -- the footage from Wei's own shop cameras, the cameras that recorded every pickup and drop-off, the cameras that showed Connor Briggs entering the back room on Day 39 and receiving a charger box, the cameras that showed Felix Decker and Wei in conversation over a table covered in packaging materials. The lawyer had seen the phone records. The lawyer had seen the banking transactions. The lawyer had seen the quantity -- four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in the suitcase, plus the accumulated evidence of months of trafficking operations.

The lawyer had done the math. The math was Section 39B. The math was the mandatory death penalty for trafficking in dangerous drugs. The math was the difference between cooperation and silence, between information exchanged for a reduced charge and silence maintained until the gallows.

The same law that had ensnared Connor -- the law of which Connor had been ignorant, the law whose existence Connor had dismissed as "that's for big-time dealers" -- the same law now motivated Wei to speak. The irony was structural, built into the architecture of the legal system: the law was a pressure, and the pressure was applied equally to the ignorant mule and the knowing supplier, and the pressure produced different responses -- the mule's panic, the supplier's calculation -- but the pressure was the same pressure, and the source of the pressure was the same seven words that appeared at the top of every briefing, every warning, every sign that Connor had failed to read: *Mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking.*

"My client is prepared to cooperate," Encik Ibrahim said. The sentence was formal, rehearsed, the legal preamble to the transaction that was about to occur. "He will provide information about the network's structure, supply chains, and operatives in exchange for the prosecution's agreement to pursue charges under Section 39A rather than 39B."

Section 39A: trafficking, reduced charge, fifteen to thirty years. Section 39B: trafficking, mandatory death. The difference between the two sections was the difference between a sentence and a death warrant, between years in a cell and a noose around a neck, between a future that was diminished and a future that did not exist. The difference was the lawyer's leverage.

Ahmad nodded. "The prosecution has agreed in principle, pending the quality of the information provided. This interview is recorded. Begin."

Wei began.

He began with the supply chain. The methamphetamine came from a lab in Shan State, Myanmar, transported overland through northern Thailand, across the border at Sadao, down the peninsula to KL. The route had been operational for four years. The volume was approximately two kilograms per month, distributed through seven cells in Peninsular Malaysia -- KL, Penang, Johor Bahru, Ipoh, Kuantan, Malacca, Kota Bharu. Wei ran the KL cell. His function was logistics: receiving the raw product, packaging it for transport, and coordinating the local distribution through couriers.

"The couriers," Ahmad said. "Tell me about the couriers."

Wei's hands moved on the table. A small movement -- the fingers shifting, the palms lifting slightly, the adjustment of a man who was about to describe the part of the operation that most directly implicated him in a boy's death.

"There are two types. Local couriers -- Malaysians, paid, permanent. They handle the domestic routes. KL to Penang, KL to JB, the regular distribution. And foreign couriers. Backpackers. Tourists."

"Mules."

"Yes."

"How are they recruited?"

"Felix handles recruitment. Only Felix. That's his function. He lives in hostels. He identifies targets -- young, Western, broke, naive. He builds relationships. He starts with small favours -- envelopes, packages. He escalates. By the time the target understands what they're carrying, they're too deep. The CCTV records every pickup. Felix shows them the footage. They're trapped."

"How many?"

Wei was quiet for a moment. The quiet was the sound of a man counting, and the counting was the counting of bodies -- not dead bodies, but the bodies that had been used, the bodies that had carried the product, the bodies that had been trapped in the system the same way Connor had been trapped.

"In KL, since I started. Eight. Connor was the eighth."

Eight. The number sat in the room like a verdict. Eight young people, over four years, recruited from the common room of the Lantern Hostel, introduced to a charming German who bought them beers and told them stories and gradually, methodically, turned them into couriers for a methamphetamine supply chain that stretched from the hills of Myanmar to the streets of Malaysian cities.

"Names," Ahmad said.

Wei provided names. Some were first names only -- the transient nature of hostel relationships meaning that Wei knew the mules by the names they used at check-in, the names that might be real or might be the names they travelled under, the names that were entered in the hostel's guest book in Razak's careful handwriting and that were now evidence.

"Lena Ekström. Swedish. Twenty-two. Recruited fourteen months ago. Arrested at Bukit Kayu Hitam, carrying for the Thai border route. She's in Kajang now."

"I know," Ahmad said. "She's asked for a lawyer."

"She'll talk. She has the same information I have. Felix's name. The hostel. The pattern."

"Who else?"

Wei named six more. An American. A New Zealander. Two Britons. An Australian woman, before Connor. A Canadian. Some had been arrested. Some had completed their routes and moved on, the network releasing them with the understanding that their fingerprints were on file and the CCTV was stored and the information was leverage that could be activated at any time, the leverage the network's insurance against the mules' testimony.

"The ones who were arrested," Ahmad said. "What happened to them?"

Wei looked at his lawyer. His lawyer looked at the table.

"Two were arrested and convicted. They're serving sentences under Section 39A -- they cooperated, like me, and the charges were reduced. One was arrested and..." Wei stopped. His hands lifted a centimetre off the table and settled again. "One was arrested and died in custody."

Ahmad leaned forward. "Which one?"

"The first one. Two and a half years ago. A man named Daniel Park. Korean-American. Twenty-four. He was arrested with 200 grams of meth at a bus terminal in JB. He was taken to the Johor Bahru district police station. He died in his cell. The report said suicide."

"Was it?"

Wei's hands were still on the table. The hands that had packaged the drugs that Daniel Park had carried. The hands that had sealed the vacuum bags and handed them to Felix and Felix had handed them to Daniel and Daniel had put them in his bag and walked to a bus terminal and been arrested and taken to a cell and died.

"It was the same as Connor. The network's protocol. When a mule is caught, the mule is silenced. The network has contacts in the police. A prisoner is placed in the cell. The guard takes a break. The death is staged as suicide."

The room was silent. The fluorescent light buzzed. The camera recorded. The silence was the silence of a system describing itself, the silence that followed the revelation that the system's efficiency included the efficiency of murder, the efficiency of silencing the people who could expose the system, the efficiency that converted a human problem into a logistical solution.

"Daniel Park," Ahmad said. He wrote the name in his notebook. The name was the second name, after Connor Briggs, in what would become a list of names -- the names of people who had been killed by the network's protocol, the names that the investigation would uncover over the coming months, the names that would appear in the court documents and the newspaper articles and the parliamentary inquiry.

"Connor Briggs," Ahmad said. "Walk me through it."

Wei walked through it. The recruitment. The escalation. The suitcase. The checkpoint. The arrest. The protocol. The guard -- Hafiz, night shift, paid three thousand ringgit in cash, delivered by an intermediary whose name Wei did not know. The prisoner -- the man they called Rizal, whose real name Wei did not know, whose function in the network was the function that no one discussed, the function that existed at the bottom of the organisational chart, below the suppliers and the packagers and the distributors and the recruiters, the function that was activated when all other functions had failed, the function of silence.

"Rizal," Ahmad said. "How do I find him?"

"You don't. He finds the network. He's contracted. He's not permanent. He operates across the region -- KL, Bangkok, Jakarta. He has multiple identities. He enters the cell as a petty criminal, does the job, is released the next morning, disappears."

"Released how?"

"The same officer who arranges the break. Hafiz, in this case. The record shows the petty criminal was released on bail. The bail is posted by a proxy. The record is clean."

Ahmad wrote. The writing was methodical, unhurried, the writing of a man who had been building a case for six months and had just received the testimony that connected the dots, that drew the lines between the nodes, that converted a suspicion into a provable pattern. The pattern was what Ahmad needed. The pattern was the evidence that this was not a single death but a system, not an incident but a method, not a tragedy but a business model.

"Felix Decker," Ahmad said. "Where is he?"

"Cambodia. Phnom Penh. He flew out on Thursday afternoon, twelve hours before Connor's arrest. He always leaves before the arrest. That's his protocol."

"How do you know he's in Cambodia?"

"He called me. Saturday morning. From a Cambodian number. He asked if the protocol had been completed. I told him it had."

Ahmad looked at Wei. The look was the look of a man who had heard a confession that was also an admission of complicity in murder -- the phone call in which one man asked another man if a third man had been killed, and the second man confirmed that the third man had been killed, and the conversation was conducted with the businesslike efficiency of two men confirming a logistics update.

"You told him the protocol had been completed," Ahmad repeated.

"Yes."

"Meaning you confirmed that Connor Briggs had been killed."

"Yes."

The word was flat. The word was the word of a man who had accepted that the word was the price of the other word -- the word that meant thirty years instead of death, the word that meant a cell instead of a gallows, the word that meant survival. Wei had made his calculation. The calculation was the same calculation that the law imposed on everyone it touched: the calculation of self-preservation, the arithmetic of survival, the mathematics of a system in which every participant was simultaneously a perpetrator and a potential victim.

Ahmad closed his notebook. He looked at Wei's hands on the table. The hands were still. The hands would remain still for a very long time -- the years of incarceration reducing the hands' function to the eating of prison food and the turning of prison-issue pages and the occasional writing of letters that no one would answer. The hands that had packaged methamphetamine would package nothing. The hands that had sealed the vacuum bags would seal nothing. The hands were finished.

"We're done for today," Ahmad said.

Nurul's testimony arrived via video link from Kajang Prison.

The screen showed a room -- a small, bare room with a table and a chair and a wall painted the institutional green that was the Malaysian prison system's colour of containment. Nurul sat at the table. She was twenty-four. She had been in Kajang for eleven months. Her face was thinner than the face in the photograph that Mama Siti kept in her wallet -- the photograph of a girl at a family gathering, round-cheeked, smiling, wearing a bright blue tudung, the photograph of a girl who had not yet been recruited and arrested and convicted and sentenced and transformed from a niece into a prisoner.

Nurul wore the prison uniform. Her hands were folded on the table. Her eyes were steady. The steadiness was not strength in the conventional sense -- it was the steadiness of a person who had spent eleven months processing the thing that had happened to her and had arrived at a state that was not acceptance but was the thing that existed beyond the exhaustion of all alternatives to acceptance.

"My name is Nurul binti Hassan. I was arrested on 14 March at the Butterworth bus terminal in Penang state. I was carrying a backpack that contained approximately three hundred grams of methamphetamine. I was charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. I was convicted. I am currently serving a life sentence, reduced from the death penalty under the court's discretion."

The words were practiced. The words had been spoken before -- to lawyers, to judges, to the prison counsellor. But the words were being spoken now to a camera that was connected to a screen in Ahmad's office at Dang Wangi, and the audience was different, and the purpose was different, and the difference was that the words were no longer a confession but a corroboration, a pattern piece, a second data point that, when placed beside the first data point of Connor Briggs, created a line, and the line pointed toward the system.

"I was recruited at the Lantern Hostel," Nurul said. "Petaling Street, Chinatown, KL. I was not a guest. I worked there -- I helped my aunt, Siti binti Ahmad, the cook. I was in the kitchen every morning. I lived with my aunt in her flat in Cheras but I spent most of the day at the hostel."

She paused. The pause was the breath before the part of the story that cost the most to tell.

"A man named Felix approached me. He was a guest. A foreigner. German. He was polite. He was charming. He said he needed someone local, someone who spoke Malay, to help with a delivery business he was setting up. Import-export. Phone accessories. He offered me five hundred ringgit a week, cash, no questions."

Ahmad listened. The listening was not passive -- the listening was the active, analytical listening of an investigator hearing a second testimony that matched a first testimony, the details aligning, the pattern emerging from the overlap. Felix. The Lantern Hostel. The charm. The offer. The phone accessories.

"He started me with envelopes," Nurul said. "Small. Sealed. Delivered to addresses in KL. Then packages. Then backpacks. The contents got heavier. I didn't ask. He told me not to ask. He said asking was bad for business."

The pattern. The identical pattern. The escalation from envelopes to packages to backpacks. The instruction not to ask. The progression that was not improvised but designed, the recruitment method that was a system, a process, a replicable template that Felix applied to each new target with the consistency of a manufacturing process -- the same inputs producing the same outputs, the same charm producing the same trust, the same trust producing the same compliance, the same compliance producing the same crime.

"When did you learn what you were carrying?" Ahmad asked.

"After six weeks. I found a bag that had torn. White powder inside. I confronted Felix. He said it was nothing -- protein powder, supplements. I didn't believe him. I told him I wanted to stop."

"What happened?"

"He showed me CCTV footage. From the shop two doors down -- the phone repair shop. The footage showed me picking up packages, putting them in my bag. He said if I stopped, the footage would go to police. He said if I went to police myself, the footage showed me but not him. He said the evidence pointed to me. I was the one on camera. I was the one carrying."

The trap. The identical trap. The CCTV as leverage, the footage as insurance, the mule's own actions converted into evidence against the mule, the system's recursive logic ensuring that the person who could expose the system was the person most endangered by the exposure. Connor had been trapped the same way. Daniel Park had been trapped the same way. Eight mules, the same trap, the same method, the same calculated, professional, systematic destruction of eight lives.

"I continued for three more months," Nurul said. "I carried larger amounts. The last delivery was the Penang route. A backpack with three hundred grams. Felix said it would be the last one. Felix always said it would be the last one."

"Tell me about the arrest."

"Butterworth bus terminal. A random check. The police found the methamphetamine in the backpack's hidden compartment. They arrested me. They charged me under 39B. The mandatory death penalty."

"And then?"

"I was in Kajang for four months before my trial. During those four months, I received a visit from a man. He said he was a lawyer. He gave me a name, a firm. He said he was there to help me, sent by friends. He asked me what I had told the police. I told him I had given the police nothing. The man said that was good. The man said that if I continued to give the police nothing, the firm would represent me and seek a reduced charge."

"The firm represented you at trial?"

"Yes. They negotiated the reduction from 39B to a life sentence. They told me to plead guilty to trafficking but to say I acted alone. No mention of Felix. No mention of the hostel. No mention of the network."

"And you agreed."

"I agreed. I was twenty-three. The alternative was death. I agreed."

The video feed was steady. Nurul's face was steady. The steadiness held everything -- the months of isolation, the four months of pre-trial detention, the trial, the sentence, the eleven months of incarceration, the accumulation of time and silence and the particular loneliness of a woman who had been recruited by a charming foreigner and arrested with a backpack of methamphetamine and abandoned by the network that had recruited her and defended by the lawyers that the network had sent and convicted on the terms that the network had negotiated. The network had managed every stage of her destruction, from recruitment to conviction, with the same efficiency that it managed the supply chain. Nurul was not a person to the network. Nurul was a logistics problem that had been solved.

"Why are you speaking now?" Ahmad asked. The question was the question that the investigation needed answered -- the question of motivation, the question of why a woman who had been silent for eleven months was now, after learning of Connor Briggs's death, willing to provide the testimony that could expose the network.

Nurul looked at the camera. The look was direct, unblinking, the look of a person who had arrived at the place beyond fear.

"Because he died," she said. "Because the Australian boy died the way Daniel died. Because I was supposed to die too -- did you know that? I was supposed to die in my cell. The protocol. But the prison moved me to a different wing the night before. A routine transfer. Administrative. The man they sent -- the one like Rizal -- he arrived at an empty cell. I was in a different wing and I was alive because of paperwork. Because of a form that someone filed that moved me from one wing to another. Paperwork saved my life."

The room was silent. The video feed continued. Nurul's face on the screen was the face of a woman who had been saved by bureaucracy, by the arbitrary, impersonal, procedural machinery of a prison system that had moved her from one cell to another without knowing that the move was the difference between her life and her death.

"I've been silent for eleven months because I was afraid. I'm not afraid anymore. The boy died. If I stay silent, another one dies. There will be another one. There is always another one."

Mama Siti visited Nurul on a Thursday afternoon.

The visiting room at Kajang Women's Prison was divided by a wall of glass -- thick, scratched by years of hands pressed against it. Mama Siti sat on the visitors' side wearing her apron, the white cotton apron stained with turmeric and chilli. She had not removed it. She had worn it through the LRT and the prison registration and the waiting, the apron that said *I am the cook, I am the one who feeds*.

Nurul appeared on the other side. She picked up the handset.

"Anak," Mama Siti said. *Child.*

"Mak Cik." *Auntie.*

"There was a boy. An Australian. He slept in the bed. The same bed."

"Bed 7," Nurul said.

"Bed 7."

"He was like me? Felix? Envelopes first, then packages?"

"Yes."

"He's dead," Nurul said. Not a question. "In custody. The protocol."

"Yes."

Nurul's eyes were wet but the wetness did not fall. "I should have spoken. Eleven months. I should have spoken on the first day."

"You were afraid."

"I was afraid. And the boy is dead because I was afraid."

Mama Siti pressed her hand against the glass. Nurul pressed hers from the other side. Palm to palm, finger to finger, separated by the thickness of institutional glass. The glass was cold on both sides.

"You can't stop it," Nurul said.

"I know."

"But you'll cook."

"I'll cook," Mama Siti said.

"Bring nasi lemak," Nurul said -- half joke, half plea.

Mama Siti looked at her niece through the glass. "I'll bring nasi lemak."

She walked out into the Kajang afternoon, an old woman in an apron heading for a train station, heading home to cook because cooking was the only answer she had to the question the system kept asking.

The hostel would reopen. The beds would be filled. The ceiling fans would turn.
