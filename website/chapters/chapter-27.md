# Chapter 27: The Card

On Day 44, at eleven PM, Connor took Sergeant Ahmad's business card out of his wallet and placed it on the thin mattress of Bed 7 and looked at it.

The card was creased now -- soft with pocket-wear, the corners rounded, the ink slightly faded where his thumb had rubbed the phone number during the hours of insomnia that had become his nightly companion. SERGEANT AHMAD BIN ISMAIL. NARCOTICS DIVISION -- DANG WANGI. The PDRM crest in blue and gold, the Royal Malaysia Police insignia that Connor had first seen on peaked caps at a checkpoint in Bukit Bintang, a lifetime ago, when he had been clean and the fear had been theoretical and the card had been a curiosity rather than a lifeline.

The dorm was dark. The French backpacker above was asleep -- he'd been replaced by a Finnish man who snored in a different register but with the same metronomic reliability. The air well breathed its nighttime breath. The ceiling fan turned.

Connor picked up the card. He picked up his phone -- the real phone, not the burner. He opened the keypad. He typed the number. The digits appeared on the screen in white: +60 3 2600 ####. He stared at them. The cursor blinked after the last digit, waiting for the instruction to connect, waiting for the thumb that would press the green button and send the signal through the Malaysian telecommunications network to a phone on a desk at Dang Wangi district police headquarters, where a man named Ahmad who had looked at Connor on a Bukit Bintang pavement and said *Malaysia is not a game* would answer and listen and do the thing that police officers did, which was act.

He could press the button. Right now. In this dark dorm, in this moment, the button was available. The call would take thirty seconds to connect. Ahmad's voice would arrive -- calm, professional, the voice of a man who had been waiting for this call the way experienced officers waited for calls that confirmed suspicions. Connor would speak. He would say: *My name is Connor Briggs. I'm Australian. I've been carrying methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur for a German national named Felix Decker who operates out of the Lantern Hostel on Petaling Street. I have a work phone with records of every delivery. I can identify the contacts: Mr. Tan, Auntie Lim, Danny, Ah Keat. The drugs are assembled at Wei's phone repair shop, two doors from the hostel. I want to cooperate.*

He could say that. The words were formed, ready, assembled in the correct order. The words would transform him from a suspect into an informant, from a defendant into a witness, from a dead man into a living one. The words were the exit. The words were the door.

His thumb hovered over the green button.

The reasons not to press it arrived in a column, each one presented with the clinical precision of a final argument:

*One: Felix has CCTV footage of every delivery. If Connor calls the police, Felix releases the footage before the police can act. The footage shows Connor carrying packages. The footage is sufficient for a trafficking charge. The footage is Connor's death sentence, released on his own initiative.*

*Two: Felix has contacts within the police. Connor didn't know this explicitly, but the operational sophistication -- the burner phones, the route management, the protocol for silencing caught mules -- implied infrastructure that extended beyond a German backpacker and a phone repair shop. If Ahmad was clean, his colleagues might not be. If Connor called and the wrong person answered, the call would reach Felix before it reached a courtroom.*

*Three: Priya. Felix had threatened her -- subtly, professionally, the way Felix threatened everything. If Connor went to the police, Priya's name would surface. Her visa status, her medical career, her family in London -- all of it exposed to the machine that Felix controlled. Connor had dragged her close enough to the fire. He could not drag her closer.*

*Four: His parents. A trafficking charge -- even as a cooperating witness -- would become public record. David and Karen Briggs of Hawthorn, Melbourne, would receive a phone call informing them that their son was involved in drug trafficking in Southeast Asia. The phone call would arrive on a Tuesday afternoon or a Sunday morning and it would destroy them -- not the clinical destruction of legal proceedings but the personal destruction of knowing that their son, the boy they'd driven to soccer and helped with homework and sent $2,000 a month, was a drug mule. The word *mule* would be in the newspapers. Megan would read it. The neighbours would read it. The golf club would read it.*

The reasons were compelling. The reasons were also, Connor understood with a clarity that had arrived too late, the product of the machine -- not the old machine, the one that had produced denial, but a new machine, one that produced paralysis, one that took the raw material of fear and manufactured inaction. The new machine was more sophisticated than the old one. The old machine said *everything is fine*. The new machine said *everything is terrible and nothing can be done*.

Both machines served the same purpose: keeping Connor still.

He looked at the phone. The number was on the screen. The green button waited. His thumb was one centimetre from the surface of the glass.

He pressed the button.

The phone connected. One ring. Two rings. Three rings. Connor's heart was in his throat, the pulse audible in his ears, the blood moving with the desperate speed of a body preparing for something enormous.

Four rings. Five rings. A click. Voicemail.

"You have reached the desk of Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi. I am unable to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone, or call the general line at--"

Connor ended the call.

He stared at the phone. The call log showed the number, the duration -- nineteen seconds -- the time. He hadn't left a message. He hadn't spoken. The call had connected to a machine, and the machine had spoken to him in Ahmad's recorded voice, and the voice had asked him to leave a message, and he had not left a message because leaving a message required speaking and speaking required courage and courage was the one resource he had exhausted completely.

He could call back. He could call the general line. He could call again in five minutes, or ten, or in the morning when Ahmad would be at his desk.

He put the phone down.

He picked up the business card. He held it between his fingers. The cardstock was soft now, worn, the paper fibres separating at the edges. The card had been in his wallet for two weeks. It had been carried through deliveries and drops and the daily mechanics of a life that was no longer a life but a countdown, and the card had waited, patient as stone, for the moment when Connor would use it.

The moment had come and gone. Nineteen seconds. Five rings. A voicemail. A silence.

Connor put the card back in his wallet. He put the wallet under his pillow, beside the blue towel. He lay in the dark and felt the full weight of what he had just done -- not the call, which was nothing, but the not-speaking, which was everything. The not-speaking was the final choice. The not-speaking was the door closing, the last door, the one that opened onto a corridor that had no other exits.

He didn't sleep. At three AM he got up and went to the air well.

The courtyard was dark, the mosaic tiles cool under his bare feet, the sky above a rectangle of orange-lit cloud. No stars. No moon. Just the city's ambient glow reflected off the atmosphere, the permanent false dawn of eight million lives generating light.

He sat on the tile bench. The bench was cold. The air was warm. The combination -- cold stone, warm air -- was the specific thermal experience of a tropical night in a building with stone floors, and it was a sensation Connor knew he would remember, in the way that condemned men remembered the small details of their last days, the texture of the wall, the temperature of the water, the sound of the guard's keys.

The air well was the architectural heart of the Lantern Hostel -- a vertical shaft carved through the building's centre, open to the sky, the walls rising three stories on each side and lined with the original Portuguese-colonial mosaic tiles that Uncle Razak claimed were older than Malaysian independence. The tiles were blue and white, geometric, the pattern repeating in a tessellation that had survived ninety-seven years of monsoons and renovations and the accumulated moisture of ten thousand tropical nights. In daylight the tiles were beautiful. At three AM they were grey, the colour leached by darkness, the pattern visible only in outline, like a blueprint for something that had once been vivid and was now reduced to structure. The air was heavy with a dampness that never fully lifted -- the tiles sweating, the residual moisture of the afternoon rain still clinging to the grout lines, the smell of wet stone mixing with the faint organic sweetness of the potted frangipani that Mama Siti kept in clay pots along the eastern wall. The rectangle of sky above was featureless -- no stars, no definition, just the amber diffusion of Kuala Lumpur's eight million lives burning electricity into the clouds. From the upper floors came the small sounds of a sleeping building: the creak of bed frames, the murmur of someone talking in a dream, the rhythmic click of a ceiling fan with a loose bearing. And from the third floor -- Felix's floor -- a sound that might have been a footstep, a single, deliberate footstep on the wooden boards above, and Connor froze, his body locking in the chemical rigidity of a man who had been surveilled for long enough that every ambient sound was a potential watcher, every creak a confirmation that the building itself was complicit. He sat motionless for thirty seconds, a minute, listening, his breath shallow, his hands flat on the cold tile, and the sound did not repeat, and the not-repeating was worse than the repeating would have been, because a sound that came once and stopped was a sound that knew it had been heard.

He thought about Lena.

The name on the bed frame. The girl from Sweden, twenty-two, who had slept in Bed 7 and carried packages for Felix and been arrested at a bus station and was now in Kajang Prison awaiting a trial that would end with the word *mandatory* and the word *death*. Lena, who had carved her name into the wood with a fingernail or a coin, the only mark she could leave in a world that was about to erase her.

Connor had been sleeping on her name for six weeks. He had placed his hand on her letters every morning as he climbed out of bed and every night as he climbed in. The letters had been under his palm -- L-E-N-A -- and he had never felt them, never looked, never turned the raw sensation of carved wood into the information it contained. The information was: *I was here. I did what you're doing. This is what happened.*

Connor had found the letters on Day 30, when the burner phone had slipped between the mattress and the frame and his hand had followed it down and his fingers had passed over the carved wood and stopped. He had pulled the mattress aside and looked. L-E-N-A. The letters were shallow, scratched rather than carved, the work of a fingernail or the edge of a coin pressed into softwood with the desperate, patient insistence of someone who needed to leave evidence that they had existed in this bed, in this room, in this building, before the system that was coming for them erased every other trace. The letters were testimony. The letters said: *I lay where you lie. I carried what you carry. I trusted the man you trust. And this is the only thing that remains of me -- four scratches in a bed frame in a hostel that has already given my bed to someone else.* Connor had replaced the mattress. He had not spoken about the letters. He had not told Priya, or Razak, or anyone, because speaking about the letters would require acknowledging what they meant, and what they meant was that Bed 7 was not a bed but a station, a waypoint in a process that had a beginning and an end, and the end was not a departure gate.

He thought about what he would carve into the wood. If he had time. If he had a coin. If the impulse to leave a mark overcame the paralysis that had replaced every other impulse in his body. He would carve: CONNOR. Six letters. Two more than LENA. Two names, two mules, two stories that were the same story told in different accents.

He sat in the air well until four. Then he went back to Bed 7. He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. The towel was smooth and cool, the microfiber catching the faint light from the air well, the fabric that would be with him at the end.

Day 45. One day to Priya's flight. One day to the final job.

The morning was bright and hot and terrible in its normalcy. The call to prayer came at 5:32. The motorcycle engines started on Petaling Street. Mama Siti's wok hit flame. The ceiling fans turned in every room. The hostel performed its morning routine with the mechanical reliability of a building that had been waking up every morning for ninety-seven years and would continue waking up long after everyone currently inside it was gone.

Connor ate breakfast. The nasi lemak was perfect. The sambal was hot. The coffee was bad. He ate and drank and tasted nothing and felt nothing and sat at the kitchen counter like a man made of the same material as the counter -- wood and surface and the accumulated marks of years.

Priya came down at nine. She was wearing a white dress -- simple, cotton, the kind of dress you wore when you wanted to feel light. Her hair was braided. Her glasses were clean. The jade bracelet was on her wrist.

She looked at Connor and saw him and what she saw was not the man she'd met at a hawker stall five weeks ago -- the brash, funny, infuriating Australian who had teased her about her guidebook and bought her a bracelet and kissed her under stars in an air well. What she saw was a man who had been taken apart, piece by piece, component by component, disassembled by a professional who knew which pieces to remove first and which to leave until last, and the last piece -- the piece that was still attached, the piece that allowed the man to move and eat and sit at a counter -- was the piece that would be removed tomorrow, on a bus, at a checkpoint, when a dog smelled the truth through the lining of a suitcase.

"Today," she said. "You and me. The whole day. Whatever you want."

He looked at her. "Whatever I want?"

"Whatever you want."

He wanted to go home. He wanted to be in his mother's kitchen in Hawthorn, eating Vegemite toast, listening to his father talk about the property market. He wanted to be twenty-two again, at the departure gate at Tullamarine, with his father's hand on his shoulder, hearing the words *the rules don't care who you are* and this time, this time, listening.

"Let's go to the Bird Park," he said.

They went to the KL Bird Park -- Taman Burung, in the Lake Gardens, the world's largest free-flight walk-in aviary. The park was a green dome stretched over a valley, the netting invisible from inside, the illusion complete: you were not in a park but in a forest, and the birds were not captive but free, and the freedom was real because it was bounded, and the bounds were invisible, and invisibility was the same as absence. Connor looked up and caught it -- the faintest shimmer of mesh against the sky, the netting that enclosed everything, the barrier that the birds could not see and therefore did not resist. The birds lived inside a boundary they didn't know existed. The birds flew and ate and called and mated and believed the sky was theirs, and the sky was theirs, except for the part above the netting, which was the real sky, and the real sky was a place the birds would never reach. Connor understood this. Connor understood this with the specific, nauseating clarity of a man who had recently discovered his own netting -- the CCTV footage, the burner phone records, the fingerprints on packages -- the invisible mesh that Felix had strung around him so carefully that Connor had not felt it until he tried to fly.

Hornbills sat in trees above them, their massive beaks absurd and beautiful, the casques like helmets designed by someone who believed birds should go to war. One landed on a branch three metres from the path -- a rhinoceros hornbill, enormous, its beak curving like a scimitar painted in shades of orange and cream, its eyes dark and ancient and completely indifferent to the two humans staring up at it. Priya gasped. The sound was involuntary, joyful, the sound of a woman encountering a living thing that was more beautiful than she had expected, and Connor looked at her face and saw the joy and the joy destroyed him, not because it was false but because it was real, because Priya could still feel joy, could still look at a bird and feel wonder, and Connor could not, and the distance between her wonder and his numbness was the distance between a person who was going to survive and a person who was not. He wanted to feel what she felt. He wanted to look at the hornbill and see the hornbill and not the metaphor, not the cage, not the netting. He wanted to be the man she thought he was -- the brash, funny Australian who teased her about guidebooks and bought her jade bracelets and kissed her under stars. That man was gone. That man had been replaced by a machine that produced paralysis, and the machine was looking at a hornbill and calculating escape routes. Flamingos stood in shallow water, one-legged, pink, performing the ancient art of standing still and looking magnificent. Parakeets swarmed in clouds of green and yellow, their calls filling the canopy with a noise that was not language but was communication, and the communication said: *we are here, we are alive, we are loud, and the loudness is the living*.

Connor and Priya walked through the park. They held hands. They didn't talk about tomorrow. They talked about the birds -- their names, their habits, the Malay words that Priya had learned from her guidebook. *Burung enggang* for hornbill. *Flamingo* for flamingo, because some things were universal. *Burung kakak tua* for cockatoo, which Priya said meant "old sister bird," and Connor laughed, and the laugh was real, and the realness of it was the most painful thing he'd felt all week, because laughter required the momentary belief that things were okay, and things were not okay, and the gap between the laughter and the truth was the gap that would swallow him.

They ate lunch at a hawker stall outside the park. Nasi goreng -- fried rice with an egg on top, the yolk running yellow into the rice when you broke it. They ate with forks and drank teh tarik and sat in plastic chairs and watched the park entrance where families were arriving with children, the children's excitement creating a sound that was the opposite of the sound in Connor's head.

"Tell me about London," Connor said.

Priya told him. She told him about King's College, about the neurology department, about the coffee shop on Strand where she studied. She told him about her flat in Bermondsey, the one with the damp problem and the view of the Shard. She told him about her parents in Ealing, her father the cardiologist who worked impossible hours, her mother who ran her GP practice in Wembley and made the best dhal in West London. She told him about the rain, which was different from KL rain -- not a vertical ocean but a persistent mist, the kind that got into your clothes and your bones and your soul and made everything grey and damp and quintessentially English.

"It sounds terrible," Connor said, smiling.

"It is terrible. It's the most terrible, wonderful, frustrating, beautiful city in the world. And I want to take you there."

"I'd like that."

The sentence was conditional -- *I'd like that* rather than *I'll go*. Priya heard the conditional. She heard the tense. She held his hand tighter and the jade bracelet pressed against his wrist and neither of them said the thing that sat between them, the thing that they both knew, which was that London was not where Connor was going, that tomorrow was not a departure but an arrival, and the arrival was at a destination that no flight could reach and no guidebook described.

They went back to the hostel at five. They sat on the rooftop. They watched the sunset -- the sky turning orange, then red, then the deep purple that KL produced on clear evenings, the colour of bruises, the colour of things that had been hit. The Petronas Towers caught the last light and held it and then released it and became silhouettes, dark fingers against the darkening sky.

"I love you," Priya said.

"I love you," Connor said.

The words were true. The words were insufficient. The words were the only currency they had, and the currency was being spent on the last evening of a thing that had never had a chance to become the thing it might have been, and the waste of it -- the beautiful, terrible waste of two people who found each other in a hostel in a country where one of them was about to be destroyed -- was the dark comedy at the heart of the novel that neither of them knew they were living.

They went to bed. Separate dorms. At the staircase landing between the second and third floors -- the dim landing where the single bulb cast a yellowed, insufficient light that made everything look like a photograph taken in the wrong decade -- Priya stopped. She turned. She put her hands on his face, both hands, her palms against his jaw, and she kissed him. Not the brief kiss of routine but the long, full, desperate kiss of someone saying goodbye without using the word, the kiss that tried to compress everything -- every moment, every meal, every night market and every mosque and every shared joke -- into a single point of contact between two pairs of lips that were warm and present and about to be separated by something larger than geography. The kiss lasted ten seconds, twenty, the duration expanding beyond the social mechanics of a goodnight kiss into the territory of a statement, a plea, a final argument. Priya's body was saying *come with me*, her hands on his face were saying *come with me*, the pressure of her mouth was the pressure of a woman who knew that if she let go the thing she was holding would fall and not get up. And Connor's body was saying *I'm sorry*, and his hands on her waist were saying *I'm sorry*, and the jade bracelet on her wrist pressed against his neck as she held him and the hard edge of the jade was a small, bright point of pain that he would remember later, in a cell, under fluorescent light, when the memory of this landing and this light and this woman's hands on his face would be the last good thing his mind produced before the last good things stopped.

The kiss ended. Priya went to Dorm 4. Connor went to Dorm 3.

He climbed into Bed 7. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. He placed both phones on the mattress -- the real phone, with his mother's last text, and the burner phone, with Felix's last instruction.

He closed his eyes. Tomorrow, Priya would fly to London. Tomorrow, Felix would give him a suitcase. Tomorrow, both doors would close.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The building breathed. The name waited. The countdown reached zero.
