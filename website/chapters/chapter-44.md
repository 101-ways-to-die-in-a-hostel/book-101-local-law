# Chapter 44: Priya Returns

The air at KLIA2 was the same air.

Priya walked through the budget terminal -- the AirAsia terminal, the terminal where Connor had arrived twelve weeks ago on a cheap flight from Bali, his phone at three percent, his plan nonexistent, his fatal confidence intact. She walked past the sign above customs. DADAH MEMBAWA MAUT -- DRUGS BRING DEATH. Red letters the height of a child. She read it. She had always read it. Connor had walked past it without reading. The not-reading was the first act of a chain that ended in a cell at Dang Wangi.

She had not come for the body -- the Australian High Commission was handling the repatriation, the bureaucratic process of transporting human remains across international borders. She had come to bring the truth home. The truth that the police report had not told. The truth that the word "suicide" had concealed.

She collected her bag, passed through customs in twelve seconds, and stepped outside into the heat of KL in late March -- thirty-two degrees, ninety percent humidity, the air pressing against her skin. She stood on the kerb and thought: *This is the last air he breathed before the cell. This heat. This country. This.*

She took a Grab to KL Sentral, then the LRT to Pasar Seni, then walked the ten minutes to Petaling Street. The walk took her past the Guan Di Temple, past the market stalls, and past Wei's phone repair shop -- sealed now with police tape and a new padlock, the shop where the packages had been assembled and the network had operated in plain sight, two doors from a hostel full of backpackers who noticed nothing.

She turned and walked to the hostel.

---

The Lantern Hostel stood where it had always stood, at the narrow end of a lane off Petaling Street, between the phone repair shop and the traditional Chinese medicine store. The facade was the same -- the pre-war plasterwork, chipped and faded, the ornate mouldings above the windows, the narrow door, and above the door the red lantern that gave the place its name. The lantern was lit. The lantern was always lit. The lantern was the first thing a guest saw and the last thing a guest remembered and the light it cast was warm and red and the warmth and redness were the hostel's invitation, the building's way of saying *come in, come in, there is shelter here, there is company, there is a bed and a meal and the temporary community of strangers*.

She entered. The bell above the door rang -- the same sound for every arrival and every departure, the bell not distinguishing between the living and the dead.

Mei Ling was at reception. Mei Ling looked up. Her expression when she saw Priya was not surprise -- Mei Ling's expression was rarely surprise, because Mei Ling had seen too many things at this reception desk to be surprised by any of them. The expression was something else. Recognition. Acknowledgment. The look of a person who had been expecting something without knowing when it would arrive.

"Priya."

"Hi, Mei Ling."

The two words were the same two words that Connor had said to Priya on the morning she left. *Hi.* The word that carried everything it couldn't say. The word that was a placeholder for the language that grief had erased.

"You came back," Mei Ling said.

"I came back."

Mei Ling reached under the counter and produced a key. Not a dorm assignment -- a private room key. Private Room 2, the room that was usually storage, sometimes rented. The room on the third floor, across the hall from Felix's former room, Felix's room that was now empty, Felix's room that had been searched by Ahmad's team and stripped of its contents and left as a hollow space that contained nothing but the memory of the man who had occupied it.

"Razak said to give you this. No charge."

Priya took the key. Brass, old, the kind of key the building had used since 1928. She held it and the holding was the first physical connection to the building that had been the setting of the worst thing that had ever happened to her.

"I need to go to Dorm 3," she said.

Mei Ling didn't ask why. Mei Ling knew why. Mei Ling nodded and Priya walked past the reception desk and through the common room -- the common room where she had sat with Connor on the sofa, where she had met him, where she had argued with him, where she had kissed him, where she had told him about the letter, where she had said goodbye -- and up the narrow staircase, the staircase where the third step from the top still squeaked, and onto the second floor, and down the corridor, past Dorm 1 and Dorm 2, to the door of Dorm 3.

She opened the door.

The dorm was the same. Eight bunks, four on each side, the wooden frames dark with age and the accumulated oils of a thousand bodies. The ceiling fan turned. The air well let in the grey light of an overcast afternoon, the light filtered through the laundry that hung on the lines above the courtyard -- a German flag beach towel, a pair of cargo shorts, a sports bra, the textile archaeology of a hostel's current population. The room smelled of damp wood and Tiger Balm and the faint, sweet rot that all old buildings in the tropics carried, the smell of timber slowly returning to the earth.

Bed 7 was on the right side, second from the back, lower bunk.

A person was sleeping in it.

The person was young -- early twenties, female, dark hair spread on the pillow, the sheet pulled to her chin. A French passport was visible in the mesh pocket of the bed frame. A copy of Camus's *L'Etranger* lay face-down on the mattress beside her, the irony of the title -- *The Stranger*, *The Outsider* -- so precise that Priya almost laughed, almost produced the sound that existed between laughter and the other thing, the sound that the absurd generated when it was too accurate to be coincidence and too cruel to be comedy.

The girl was sleeping in Connor's bed. The bed where he had lain awake at three in the morning, his hand brushing the carved letters he never read. Another body in the same space, the replacement without ceremony, the way the sea closed over a swimmer.

Priya stood in the doorway and looked at Bed 7 and the looking was the goodbye.

The goodbye she had not had. The system had taken that too -- along with his body, his belongings, his bed assignment. Processed him out. She stood in the doorway the way she had stood at bedsides during her hospital placements, beside patients who were already gone, the body present, the person absent, the gap between the two the thing that medicine could measure but not close.

She stood for three minutes. She did not enter the room. She did not touch the bed. She did not wake the girl. She stood and looked and the looking was enough, was all she could have, was the closest she would get to the physical space where Connor had been alive, the space that had held his body and now held another body and would hold another after that and another after that, the space that was the same space and was different space because the person who had made it his was gone and the gone was permanent.

She turned and walked back down the corridor. The third step from the top squeaked. The squeak was the same squeak. Everything was the same and nothing was the same and the sameness was the cruelty.

Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters was a building that looked like what it was.

The building was concrete and functional, the architecture of authority -- square, solid, designed not to invite but to contain, not to welcome but to process. The Malaysian flag flew from the pole above the entrance. The PDRM crest was mounted on the wall. The air conditioning hit Priya as she entered and the cold was the cold of institutions, the artificial climate that government buildings maintained as proof of their separation from the street, the temperature saying *this is not outside, this is inside, and inside the rules are different*.

She had called Ahmad from London. She had called him on the number he had given Razak, the number that was now in her phone under the name SGT AHMAD -- DANG WANGI. She had told him she was coming back. He had said: "You don't have to." She had said: "I know." The exchange was the exchange of two people who understood that obligation was not the same as compulsion, that the drive to return was not duty but something else, something that lived in the space between duty and love and guilt and the need to see, to physically see, the place where the person you loved had died.

Ahmad met her in the lobby. He was shorter than she expected -- shorter than his voice, which was deep and measured and carried the authority of a man who had spent twenty years in the police force and had learned that authority was not volume but precision. He wore the uniform of the PDRM -- the khaki shirt, the dark trousers, the insignia of a sergeant in the Narcotics Division. His face was the face of a man in his forties who had seen things that had aged him, the lines around his eyes deeper than they should have been, the grey at his temples more than genetics alone could account for.

"Miss Sharma."

"Sergeant Ahmad."

They shook hands. The handshake was formal, correct, the handshake of two people meeting in a professional context who were connected by a tragedy that made professionalism both necessary and insufficient. His hand was dry and firm. Hers was damp from the walk from the LRT station.

"Thank you for your letter," he said. "And for coming back. You didn't have to come back."

"I had to come back."

He nodded. The nod carried something that the professional handshake had not -- the weight of a man who had read the same report that Priya had read and who did not believe it either.

He led her to his office. The office was on the second floor -- a room with a desk, two chairs, a filing cabinet, a window that looked onto a car park. The desk was covered in folders. The folders were the case -- the case that had started with Priya's letter and Tomoko's photographs and Razak's cooperation and had grown, in the weeks since, into the bureaucratic mass of a murder investigation, the mass that consisted of statements and forensic reports and phone records and bank records and CCTV footage and the accumulated evidence of a system responding to its own failure.

"I can show you some of the file," Ahmad said. "Not all. There are things that are sub judice -- the prosecution is building its case. But the parts that involve your statement, your evidence, the context."

He opened a folder. He turned it toward her. She read.

She read the arrest report. The report described Connor's arrest at a police checkpoint between Tapah and Ipoh on the North-South Expressway. The report described the drug dog's alert. The report described the opening of the suitcase, the discovery of five vacuum-sealed bags containing 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in the suitcase lining. The report described Connor's response: *Subject became distressed. Subject stated: "I didn't know. Mate, I swear, I didn't know." Subject was advised of his rights under Malaysian law.*

She read the processing record. The record described Connor's arrival at Dang Wangi. The record listed his belongings: one mobile phone (Samsung, cracked screen), one wallet (containing RM340, one Australian driver's licence, one debit card), one pair of Birkenstock sandals, one braided leather bracelet, one blue Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel.

She stopped at the towel. The towel was listed between the bracelet and the entry that said *End of personal effects*. The towel was an item on a list. The towel was a thing that had been catalogued and recorded and placed in a plastic bag and the placement was the last bureaucratic act performed on a possession that had been Connor's most constant companion, the towel that had been to twelve countries and dried his body on beaches and been wrapped around his shoulders in the cell and been the instrument of his death.

The towel was listed. The towel was in evidence. The towel was not in the cell.

"Can I see the cell?" she asked.

Ahmad paused. The pause was the pause of a man weighing a request against protocol, protocol against compassion, the rules of an active investigation against the needs of a woman who had loved the victim.

"It's not standard procedure."

"I know."

He stood. She stood. He led her out of the office and down a staircase -- not the main staircase but a side staircase, the staircase that connected the administrative floors to the custody level, the staircase that descended from the world of desks and files and the bureaucratic management of crime to the world of cells and bars and the physical containment of the accused. The staircase was narrow. The walls were painted the same institutional grey as everything else in the building. The fluorescent lights buzzed.

The custody corridor was at the bottom. The corridor was long, narrow, concrete floor, cells on both sides. The cells were identical -- three metres by three metres, concrete walls painted grey, a steel bench bolted to the wall, bars on the front painted institutional green, a squat toilet in the corner. Each cell had a number painted on the wall above the door.

They walked to the end of the corridor. Cell C-7.

Ahmad stopped. He did not enter. He stood to the side and let Priya stand at the bars and look in.

The cell was empty. The cell was clean -- the industrial clean of a space that had been processed by a forensic team and then cleaned by a janitorial crew, the double erasure of evidence and trace, the professional removal of everything that had happened followed by the chemical removal of everything that remained. The concrete floor was spotless. The steel bench was bare. The squat toilet was dry.

The fluorescent light was on. The light was always on -- on when Connor was alive in this cell, on when he was dying, on when he was dead, on now. The light was indifferent to the states of the bodies it illuminated.

Priya looked at the cell. She looked at the bench where Connor had lain. She looked at the bars from which his body had been hung. She looked at the ceiling, at the fluorescent tube, at the buzzing white light that had been the last thing Connor saw, the light that had narrowed to a point and then to nothing.

She looked for the towel. The towel was not there. The towel was in evidence, in a plastic bag, in a locker, in a room in this building, catalogued and tagged and preserved as Exhibit 14 in the murder investigation that the towel had made necessary. The towel's absence was the loudest thing in the cell. The absence was louder than the fluorescent buzz, louder than the silence, louder than the institutional hum of the building's ventilation system. The absence said: *something was here that is no longer here, and the no-longer-here is the evidence that something happened, and the something that happened is the reason you are standing at these bars*.

"How long did it take?" she asked.

Ahmad was quiet for a moment. The moment was the moment of a man deciding how much truth to share, how much clinical detail a grieving woman could hold, how much of the forensic reality was necessary for the understanding she sought.

"The pathologist estimated three to four minutes of sustained compression. Loss of consciousness within twenty to thirty seconds. Brain death within four to six minutes."

"Was he awake? Did he know?"

"The evidence suggests he was conscious when the attack began. There were defensive marks on his hands. Abrasions on his fingernails consistent with attempting to grip a smooth surface. He fought."

"He fought."

The words were not a question. The words were a statement, a fact, a piece of information that Priya received and stored in the place where she stored the things about Connor that mattered -- the real things, the things that the Instagram persona and the breezy confidence and the "she'll be right" had concealed. Connor had fought. Connor, who had never fought for anything, who had drifted through life on the current of his own ease, who had taken the path of least resistance at every turning -- Connor had fought. In the cell, at the end, when the towel was around his neck and the light was narrowing, he had fought.

It wasn't enough. It was never going to be enough. But he had fought.

"Thank you," she said.

*Bas*, she thought. *Enough.* The Gujarati arriving uninvited, the way it did when she was small and frightened, the language her mother used to end things.

She stepped back from the bars. She did not touch them. The not-touching was deliberate -- the bars were the boundary between the world she occupied and the world where Connor had died, and the boundary was a kind of membrane, and crossing it, even with a hand, felt like a transgression, like entering a space that belonged to the dead and the dead alone.

They walked back up the staircase. The fluorescent lights buzzed. The institutional grey surrounded them. The building processed their passage the way it processed everything -- silently, efficiently, without acknowledgment.

Tomoko was in the common room when Priya returned to the hostel.

She was sitting at the table by the window, her replacement Canon beside her, and spread on the table, printed on A4 paper in rows of six, were photographs. Fifty-nine photographs.

They had not seen each other since the day Priya left. Tomoko stood and crossed the room and put her arms around Priya -- brief, firm, the embrace of a person who did not embrace easily but who understood that certain moments required it.

They sat. The photographs were between them.

"I backed them up before the camera was stolen," Tomoko said. "Cloud server in Tokyo. Ahmad has everything. But these are the ones The Star is publishing."

The photographs were organised chronologically. Felix in the common room, Day 3. Felix and Connor on the rooftop, Day 4, Felix's hand on Connor's shoulder -- the hand of a handler establishing contact with a recruit. Felix at Wei's phone repair shop, Day 9. Connor on Petaling Street with a package under his arm, Day 10. Connor at a shophouse in Jalan Ipoh, Day 16, handing a package to a woman Ahmad had since identified and arrested.

"You had all this," Priya said.

"I had it from Day 9. I had enough to go to the police and I didn't go."

"Why?"

"I was building a story," Tomoko said. "I'm a photojournalist. When I started seeing Felix's operation, I thought: this is the story. The photographs, the evidence, the narrative arc. I was thinking in frames and deadlines, in column inches and publication dates."

She paused.

"I was building a story when I should have been making a phone call. One phone call. That's all it would have taken. Instead, I took photographs. I documented. I watched a man walk into a trap and photographed the walking and told myself the documentation was a form of action. The documentation was not action. It was the thing I did instead of action. And it cost a man his life."

The ceiling fans turned. Through the kitchen doorway, Mama Siti was visible at her station, the rhythm of her hands constant.

"The photographs are being published," Priya said.

"The Star. Tomorrow. Front page."

"We both failed him," Priya said.

"Yes."

"I left. You watched."

"Yes."

"And he's dead."

"Yes."

The third *yes* settled between them on the table, among the photographs, and the settling was not absolution but was, perhaps, the beginning of the thing that preceded absolution.

The Australian High Commission was on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng, in the diplomatic quarter. Priya arrived at ten the following morning. Sarah Chen -- the consular officer who had called Connor's parents at 3 AM, the voice that had crossed twelve thousand kilometres of telephone line to change the shape of two lives -- met her in the waiting area.

They sat in a small meeting room.

"I want to be clear about what the High Commission can and can't do," Sarah Chen said. "We've requested a full post-mortem, which has been conducted. We've lodged a formal request for a coroner's inquest."

"The police report said suicide."

"The murder investigation says otherwise. The inquest is the legal mechanism for resolving that conflict. But the process can take months."

"His parents are coming."

"Tomorrow. I'll be accompanying them to the morgue for the formal identification."

Priya looked at Sarah Chen -- the system's human face, steady-eyed, hands folded on the table, professional and person simultaneously.

"I want to tell you something," Priya said. "Not as a witness. Just as a person."

"Of course."

"He was arrogant and careless and ignorant and he dismissed every warning and he trusted the wrong person and he did everything wrong. Everything." She paused. "And he was kind. He bought me a jade bracelet at the night market because I looked at it for three seconds. He sat with Mama Siti in the kitchen and tried to learn how to make sambal and burned his hand and laughed. He called his mother on Sundays. He was a person. Not a headline. Not a case file. Not a mule. A person."

The jade bracelet was on Priya's wrist. Sarah Chen looked at it. She looked at Priya. She nodded.

"We're pressing for a full inquest," she said. "And we'll keep pressing."

Priya took a taxi back to Petaling Street. She entered the hostel. The bell rang. She climbed the staircase. She sat on the bed in Private Room 2 and held the jade bracelet and the holding was the holding of the last physical evidence that a man had loved her in this building, in this country where the penalty for ignorance was death and the payment was final and the receipt was a bracelet made of jade.

Tomorrow, the parents would come.
