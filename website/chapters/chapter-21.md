# Chapter 21: The Noose

Felix was standing at the railing, silhouetted against the city, and the city behind him was beautiful the way all traps were beautiful -- illuminated, inviting, designed to draw you closer.

The Petronas Towers were silver-white against the darkening sky, the last light catching their cladding and throwing it back as something colder than warmth. Below, the grid of Petaling Street was beginning its nightly transformation -- the daytime market contracting, the night market expanding, the LED lights stringing to life in blue and white and orange. From the rooftop, the city looked manageable. From the rooftop, everything looked manageable. That was the rooftop's lie.

"Sit down, Connor." Felix's voice was calm. Not warm -- the warmth had been recalibrated in the past few days, rationed, deployed more sparingly, the way a declining empire conserves its resources. What remained was something more efficient: authority without performance, command without charm.

Connor sat. The plastic chair was damp with the evening's humidity. His hands were still trembling -- the aftershock of what he'd seen in Wei's back room, the aftershock of almost calling Ahmad, the aftershock of choosing this rooftop over that phone call.

Felix turned from the railing. He didn't sit. He stood, and the standing was deliberate -- the physical arrangement of a conversation in which one person held the power and the other held the chair.

"I know what happened today," Felix said.

The sentence sat in the air between them like something placed rather than spoken.

"Wei told me you went into the back room. He said you saw the workbench. The packaging materials. The scale." Felix's voice was even, measured, the voice of a man reading a report rather than making an accusation. "He said you looked. He said your hands shook. He said you took the charger box and left without speaking."

Connor said nothing. The machine tried to engage -- tried to produce a deflection, a denial, a smooth rationalisation that would restore the equilibrium -- but the machine was running on fumes and what it produced was silence, which was the most honest output the machine had ever generated.

"I understand," Felix said. "I do. You've seen things that are difficult to reconcile with what I've told you. The packaging, the scale, the weight. You're not stupid, Connor. You were never stupid. You were trusting, which is different, and trust was what made you valuable."

The word *valuable* landed like a coin on the zinc railing -- metallic, precise, its worth calculated in advance.

"I'm going to tell you the truth now," Felix said. "Because we've reached the point where the truth is more useful than the story."

He paced -- two steps left, two steps right, the compact movement of a man who thought on his feet. The scar on his eyebrow caught the city's ambient light.

"The packages you've been carrying contain methamphetamine. Crystal meth. The envelopes contained cash -- payment for previous shipments. The brown paper packages contained small quantities -- fifty, sixty grams. The sports bags contained larger quantities -- two hundred to four hundred grams. The backpack you took to Sentul contained approximately six hundred grams, divided into seven packets. The charger box you picked up today contained seventy-two grams."

He said the numbers the way a banker says interest rates -- factual, decimal, without the weight that the numbers carried in other contexts. In other contexts -- in courtrooms, in police reports, in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 -- these numbers were death sentences. In Felix's mouth, they were inventory.

Connor heard the numbers. The numbers entered his mind and arranged themselves in a column -- 50, 60, 200, 400, 600, 72 -- and the column had a total, and the total was a number that represented, in grams, the cumulative weight of everything he'd carried across KL in the past five weeks. The total was a number so far above the fifty-gram threshold that the threshold was irrelevant, a speed bump in a rearview mirror.

The machine tried. The machine made its best attempt -- tried to engage the rationalisation protocols, tried to find the gap in Felix's arithmetic, the decimal point in the wrong place, the unit error that would collapse the total back down to something survivable. But there was no gap. The arithmetic was clean. Felix had said the numbers the way you'd read items off a receipt, and Connor's mind was now performing the calculation it had refused to perform for five weeks: each delivery multiplied by the fifty-gram threshold, each multiplication producing a mandatory death sentence, fourteen deliveries producing fourteen death sentences that were really one death sentence carried fourteen times by a man who had thought he was carrying phone accessories and import-export samples and things that didn't need names because names would have required questions and questions would have required answers and the answers were in Felix's mouth right now, numbered and weighed and delivered with the flat precision of a man reading inventory. He had carried death sentences like groceries. He had slung them over his shoulder in a daypack next to a water bottle and a copy of *The Beach*. The machine searched for something to say about this and the machine produced nothing, because the machine had been built to process ambiguity and there was no ambiguity left.

"Why are you telling me this?" Connor's voice was hoarse. The voice of a man who has been breathing the wrong air.

"Because you already know. You've known since the back room. Maybe longer. And because what happens next depends on whether we're honest with each other."

Felix stopped pacing. He stood in front of Connor -- close, two metres, the distance of a conversation between friends, the distance of a conversation between a handler and his asset.

"Here's the situation, Connor. You have been carrying methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur for five weeks. Fourteen individual deliveries. Multiple locations, multiple contacts. Your face is on CCTV at every pickup and every drop -- Wei's shop has cameras, the hostel has cameras, Mr. Tan's building has cameras, the Sentul warehouse has cameras. Your fingerprints are on every package -- the paper, the nylon, the tape. Your phone -- the work phone I gave you -- contains a record of every instruction, every address, every confirmation. Your bank account contains RM14,000 in deposits that cannot be explained by social media consulting."

Each sentence was a brick. Felix was building a wall, and the wall was around Connor, and the wall was made of evidence, and the evidence was irrefutable because the evidence was real -- it was the trail that Connor had left, delivery by delivery, transfer by transfer, the breadcrumb trail of a man walking into the forest who had never looked back to see what the breadcrumbs spelled.

"If I go to the police--" Connor started.

"If you go to the police, you are confessing to drug trafficking. The CCTV footage, the fingerprints, the phone records, the bank deposits -- they are evidence against *you*. Not against me. I'm not on those cameras. My name is not in your phone -- you have a number, not a name. My fingerprints are not on the packages -- I wear gloves, Connor. I have always worn gloves."

The word *gloves* detonated in Connor's mind. Felix had worn gloves. Felix had always worn gloves. The thin leather driving gloves he wore when handling the packages -- Connor had noticed them, had even commented once ("Bit fancy for KL, mate"), and Felix had laughed and said something about eczema, and Connor had accepted it because accepting was what he did, because accepting was the machine's fuel, because not accepting would have required a question and the question would have required an answer and the answer was *I'm wearing gloves so my fingerprints aren't on the drugs I'm giving you to carry*.

He could see the gloves now. He could see them with a clarity that was almost hallucinatory -- the soft brown leather, the stitched seams, the way Felix pulled them on before touching any package, every time, without exception, the gesture so practised it had looked like habit rather than protocol. Connor had stood there with his bare hands, his fingerprints pressing into paper and nylon and packing tape, his skin leaving its signature on every surface, and two metres away Felix had been wearing gloves and the gloves were the moat between Felix and the evidence and the moat had been visible the entire time and the machine had looked at the moat and called it eczema. The machine had encountered the single most incriminating detail in five weeks of incriminating details and had filed it under *personal quirk* and moved on, because the truth the gloves contained was too large, too precisely engineered, and processing it would have required dismantling the entire architecture of denial that kept Connor walking and carrying and sleeping at night.

"You set me up," Connor said.

"I prepared you." Felix's correction was gentle, almost kind, the way a teacher corrects a student's misunderstanding. "There's a difference. Setting up implies malice. I'm a professional. What I did was build a system in which you operate efficiently and I operate safely. That's not malice. That's design."

"You designed this. From the first day."

"From the first evening. Common room. You were broke, you were lonely, you were desperate to belong. You told me within twenty minutes of meeting me that your bank balance was critical, your parents supported you, and you'd do anything to avoid going home. You gave me your vulnerability like a gift. I would have been negligent not to use it."

The honesty was devastating. Not because it was cruel -- Felix delivered it without cruelty, without satisfaction, without the sadism that movie villains displayed when revealing their plans. He delivered it the way an engineer explains a mechanism: here is the design, here are the inputs, here is the output. The cruelty was in the accuracy, not in the delivery. Connor sat there and heard his own loneliness described as an engineering input, his desperation quantified as a resource, his need to belong catalogued as a vulnerability that had been identified and exploited with the same clinical detachment with which Wei weighed grams on the digital scale. He had been assessed. On that first evening, on this very rooftop, with the beers and the towers and the feeling of arrival -- he had been assessed, the way a locksmith assesses a lock, and Felix had found the mechanism simple.

Connor sat in the plastic chair and felt the last wall collapse. Not the rationalisation wall -- a different wall, the wall between the person he'd believed himself to be and the person he actually was. The person he'd believed himself to be was a traveler, an adventurer, a free spirit making unconventional choices. The person he actually was sat in a plastic chair on an illegal rooftop in Kuala Lumpur, having been told by his handler that he was a drug mule, that the evidence was irrefutable, that the exit was sealed.

"What do you want?" Connor said.

"One more job." Felix sat down now -- across from Connor, chair to chair, the posture of equals, though they were not equals and had never been. "One final delivery. Bigger than the others. After that, you're done. I release you. The work phone disappears. The schedule ends. You go to Langkawi, or London, or Melbourne, or wherever. Free."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I have no reason to protect you. The CCTV footage, the phone records, the bank transfers -- they exist whether you cooperate or not. Right now, they're contained. They're in systems I have access to. If you refuse, I have no incentive to keep them contained."

The threat was precise and bloodless, delivered without raised voice or menacing gesture, the way all professional threats were delivered -- as information rather than intimidation, as cause and effect rather than violence.

"You'd turn me in."

"I'd step aside. The footage exists. The records exist. If the police find them, they find them. I wouldn't need to do anything except stop protecting you."

Connor stared at Felix. Felix stared back. The city hummed behind them. The Petronas Towers watched. And between two men on a rooftop, the last pretence of friendship dissolved like sugar in water, leaving only the mechanism beneath -- clean, functional, and utterly without mercy.

"One job," Connor said. "Then I'm done."

"Then you're done."

"What is it?"

Felix smiled. Not the warm smile, not the charming smile, not the smile that had recruited Connor in the common room five weeks ago. This smile was thinner, more efficient, the smile of a man who had received the answer he expected.

"A suitcase," Felix said. "KL to Penang. By bus. I'll give you the details when the time comes."

"When?"

"Soon. A few days. I'll tell you when."

He stood. The conversation was over. The rooftop was dark now, the city's light the only illumination, the Petronas Towers the only vertical structure that mattered. Felix walked to the door.

"Connor."

"Yeah."

"Don't contact the police. Don't contact the embassy. Don't tell Priya. Don't tell anyone. If you do, the footage surfaces. And the footage, by itself, without my testimony, without context, is a death sentence. You understand that."

"I understand."

Felix nodded. The nod was the period at the end of a sentence that had been five weeks in the writing. He opened the door and descended the staircase and his footsteps were quiet and the third step did not squeak and the door to his room on the third floor opened and closed and the building absorbed his absence the way it absorbed everything -- silently, completely, without judgement.

Connor sat on the rooftop alone. The city was below. The sky was above. And between them, in a plastic chair on an illegal structure, a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had wanted nothing more than to avoid going home had just agreed to carry a suitcase full of methamphetamine from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, on a bus, through a country that would kill him for it.

The sounds of Petaling Street rose around him -- the night market winding down, the vendors folding tarps and stacking crates, the clatter of metal poles being disassembled. A motorcycle engine started somewhere below, coughed, caught, and joined the traffic's hum. From three streets away, the tinny pulse of a karaoke bar bled through the air, someone singing a Cantonese ballad off-key, the melody drifting upward and dissolving before it reached the rooftop. The Guan Di Temple was closing -- he could hear the iron gate rolling shut, the sound of metal on concrete that he'd learned to recognise as the city's evening punctuation, the full stop at the end of the market day. These were the sounds he'd loved when he first arrived. These were the sounds of the first evening on this rooftop, the evening Felix had produced two Tigers from somewhere and handed one to Connor and stood at the railing and pointed to the Petronas Towers and said, *Beautiful, isn't it*, and Connor had felt the vast, bright, uncomplicated happiness of a man who had arrived somewhere and believed the arriving was enough. The beer had been cold. The towers had been silver. The city had stretched below them like a promise, and Connor had thought, *This is it, this is the life*, and Felix had been standing exactly where he'd stood tonight, the same railing, the same silhouette, and the difference between that evening and this one was everything, was the distance between the man who arrives and the man who cannot leave.

The sweat on his skin was cooling. The night air moved across the rooftop -- not cold, never cold in KL, but cooler than the air his body was producing, and the differential registered as a chill -- the body's heat retreating inward to protect something vital while the skin went damp and expendable.

He didn't cry. He didn't scream. He didn't call Ahmad. He sat in the dark and felt the particular stillness of a man who has reached the bottom of something and found that the bottom was not solid ground but water, and the water was rising.

The business card was in his wallet. The burner phone was in his pocket. Both options were still there. Both doors were still open. But Connor had walked through one and the other was closing, inch by inch, and the closing was not something being done to him but something he was allowing, the way you allow a door to close by standing still, by not reaching for the handle, by watching it swing shut with the quiet click of something final.

The ceiling fan would be turning in Bed 7 when he got there. The blue towel would be under his pillow. The name would be on the bed frame. And in the morning, the call to prayer would come at 5:32, and the city would ask its question, and Connor would not answer, because Connor had stopped answering a long time ago, and the silence was the answer, and the answer was the end.
