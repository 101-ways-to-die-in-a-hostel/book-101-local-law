# Chapter 20: The Phone Shop

Wei's phone repair shop had been next to the hostel since the day Connor arrived, and Connor had walked past it every day without going inside.

This was about to change. The burner phone buzzed at 8:47 AM on Day 39 with a message from Felix that was different from the usual messages in one specific way: the pickup location was not Felix's room.

*Today's item is at Wei's. Go to the shop. Tell him Felix sent you. He'll have a charger box for you. Drop at Bukit Bintang, Danny, Lot 22B. RM500.*

Connor read the message standing at the kitchen counter, Mama Siti's nasi lemak growing cold on its banana leaf. He read it again. The message was clear. The message was also an escalation, though Connor would not recognise it as such until later, when the recognition no longer mattered. Previously, Felix had been the intermediary -- the packages originated from Felix's room, passed through Felix's hands, carried Felix's imprint. The instruction to go directly to Wei's shop removed Felix from the chain. It connected Connor to the source.

He left the hostel at nine fifteen. Turned left. Walked three metres to the phone repair shop.

The shop occupied the ground floor of a pre-war shophouse identical to the hostel's -- narrow, deep, the facade covered in layers of signage: WEI PHONE REPAIR in hand-painted letters, SCREEN REPLACEMENT ALL BRANDS in a laminated sheet, CHEAP FAST RELIABLE in marker on cardboard. The window display was a archaeology of mobile technology: cracked iPhone 6s, Samsung cases, coiled USB cables, a Nokia 3310 that looked like it had survived a war. A bell hung above the door, the kind that rang when you pushed it open, a sound from a different century.

Connor pushed. The bell rang. He stepped inside.

The interior was narrow -- maybe two metres wide, four metres deep -- and every surface was covered. The walls were shelving, the shelving was full: phone cases in plastic bags, screen protectors in dusty boxes, earbuds on cardboard cards, charging cables coiled like hibernating snakes. The counter ran the length of the right wall, waist-high, wooden, scarred with burns from a soldering iron. Behind the counter, more shelving, more components, and a workbench with a magnifying lamp, a soldering station, and the small, precise tools of a repair technician -- tweezers, screwdrivers, spudgers, suction cups.

Wei was behind the counter.

He was approximately forty-five. Chinese-Malaysian. Thin, with the particular thinness of a man who forgot to eat, the bones of his wrists visible below rolled-up sleeves. His face was narrow, his eyes behind rectangular glasses, his expression carrying the concentrated focus of someone who spent his days peering at small things and had trained his features for precision rather than warmth. He wore a grey polo shirt and cotton trousers and had the posture of a man who spent twelve hours a day hunched over a workbench.

He looked up when Connor entered. The look was brief -- a flash of recognition, the quick assessment of a man who knew who Connor was and had been expecting him. Then the look dropped back to the phone he was working on, a Samsung with its back panel removed, its electronic guts exposed.

"Felix sent me," Connor said.

Wei nodded. Still not looking up. His soldering iron touched a connection point on the phone's board, and a tiny plume of smoke rose -- the smoke carrying the sharp, metallic smell of heated solder, a smell that lived in the olfactory territory between chemistry and craft.

"Wait," Wei said.

Connor waited. The shop was quiet -- a muffled, dense quiet, the sound absorbed by the packed merchandise on every surface, the only noises the faint hiss of the soldering iron and the tick of a wall clock that was fifteen minutes slow.

He looked around. The shop was exactly what it appeared to be: a phone repair business, functioning, stocked, legitimate. Customers had been here -- he could see the intake forms on a clipboard beside the register, handwritten, names and phone models and problems: *screen crack*, *battery dead*, *no charge*. The shelf behind the counter held phones in various states of repair, each in a labelled plastic bag. The business was real. The phone repair was real.

But the business was also something else. Connor could feel it -- the *else-ness* of the space, the way a room feels when it has more than one purpose, the way a person feels when they have more than one identity. The shop was a shop, and it was also the place where the packages originated. It was the place where Tomoko had photographed the digital scale. It was the place where Felix had stood at eleven PM with his hands flat on the counter, looking at something with the focused intensity of a man conducting business that was not phone repair.

Wei set down the soldering iron. He stood. He was taller than Connor expected -- six feet, maybe more -- the height hidden by his hunched posture. He moved to the back of the shop, to a door that Connor hadn't noticed because it was the same colour as the wall, partially hidden by a shelf of phone cases, the doorframe visible only by the thin shadow at its edge.

He opened the door. "Come," he said.

Connor followed. The door opened onto a corridor -- short, dark, maybe two metres -- and the corridor opened onto a room.

The back room was larger than the shop. It had the dimensions of the full shophouse ground floor, maybe four by six metres, the ceiling low, the walls unpainted concrete. A single fluorescent tube hung from the ceiling, casting the flat, blue-white light that fluorescents produced -- the light of police stations and hospitals and places where beauty was irrelevant.

The room was a workshop. A different kind of workshop from the front -- not phone repair but something else, something that operated at a different scale and with a different purpose. A long metal table ran the centre of the room, stainless steel, clean. On the table: rolls of cling film, boxes of vacuum bags, a vacuum sealer the size of a shoebox, rolls of black plastic sheeting, tape dispensers, scissors. And at the far end of the table, the digital scale -- the same scale from Tomoko's photograph, the flat metal platform catching the fluorescent light, the LCD display dark, waiting.

On the floor, beside the table, cardboard boxes. Stacked. Closed. Connor counted six.

Wei moved to a shelf against the back wall. The shelf held commercial packaging -- boxes for phone chargers, the kind you'd buy in any electronics shop: white cardboard, printed with product photos and spec lists and CE marks and the reassuring language of legitimate commerce. Wei selected a box. It was the size of a large phone charger -- rectangular, maybe twenty centimetres long, ten wide, five deep. He brought it to the table.

The box was already sealed. Cellophane-wrapped, the wrap tight and professional, the kind of wrapping that suggested factory packaging, mass production, the clean supply chain of a legitimate product. The box's label read: POWERMAX ULTRA FAST CHARGER -- USB-C/LIGHTNING -- 65W. Below the text, a photo of a white charger with multiple ports.

Wei held the box out. Connor took it.

The box was heavier than a phone charger.

Not dramatically heavier. Not the seven kilograms of the red backpack. But heavier than the plastic and circuit board of a 65W charger, heavier than the cardboard and cellophane that held it, heavier in a way that his hands registered and his mind, trained by five weeks of carrying things that were heavier than they should be, identified immediately.

The box weighed approximately 120 grams. A charger of this type weighed perhaps 50 grams. The difference -- 70 grams -- was the weight of what was inside the box that was not a charger.

Seventy grams. More than the fifty-gram threshold. The mandatory threshold. The death threshold.

The number appeared in his mind -- 50 grams, the number from Astrid's lecture at the bar, the number from Priya's printed law, the number that sat at the intersection of chemistry and jurisprudence like a tripwire across a road. Fifty grams of methamphetamine triggered the presumption of trafficking. Fifty grams reversed the burden of proof. Fifty grams changed the sentence from years to death.

The box in Connor's hand was heavier than fifty grams. The box in Connor's hand was a death sentence wrapped in cellophane and printed with a charger logo.

He stood in the back room of Wei's phone repair shop and held the box and the box held the truth and the truth was in his hands and his hands were shaking.

Not visibly. The shake was internal, subcutaneous, the body's honest response to a fact the mind had spent five weeks refusing to process. His fingers were steady on the cardboard. His arms were still. But inside, beneath the skin, the tremor was there -- the vibration of a system under stress, the hum of a machine running past its tolerances.

Wei watched him. Wei's expression had not changed. It had not changed because Wei's expression was not a variable -- it was a constant, the flat, neutral face of a man who assembled packages and handed them to couriers and did not invest emotion in the handoff because emotion was not part of the process. Wei was a function. Wei performed his function. The function did not require expression.

"Danny. Bukit Bintang," Wei said. The instruction was delivered in the same flat tone as *come* and *wait*, the vocabulary of a man who communicated in commands and expected compliance.

Connor put the box in his daypack. The box sat in the bag alongside his water bottle and his cracked phone and the copy of *The Beach* he was never going to read. The box was the size of a charger. The box looked like a charger. The box, to any observer, to any police officer, to any checkpoint, was a charger -- a tourist's charger, purchased at a shop in Chinatown, carried in a daypack, unremarkable.

Unless they opened it. Unless they weighed it. Unless they ran a test on the white crystalline substance that was packed inside the charger housing in a sealed plastic bag, occupying the space where the transformer and voltage regulators should have been. Unless they found the 70 grams -- or whatever the actual weight was, the weight that Wei had measured on the scale before sealing the box, the weight that was above the threshold, above the line, above the point of no return.

Connor walked out of the back room. Through the corridor. Through the shop. Past the Nokia 3310 and the cracked iPhones and the coiled cables and the bell above the door that rang when he pushed it open.

The morning heat of Petaling Street hit him. The sound of the market hit him. The smell -- fried dough, diesel, incense from the temple -- hit him. The city was there, real and present and indifferent, and Connor was there too, standing on the pavement with a daypack containing a box containing something that would kill him if he was caught with it, and he was going to carry it to Bukit Bintang and give it to a man named Danny in the back of a defunct karaoke bar and collect RM500 and come home and eat Mama Siti's nasi lemak and post on Instagram and pretend that he was living the dream.

He walked. He didn't take a Grab. He walked because the walking gave him time and the time gave his mind the space to process what it had seen -- the back room, the table, the cling film, the vacuum bags, the scale -- and the processing was necessary because the machine needed raw material and the raw material had to be converted from evidence into something else, something manageable, something that allowed him to keep walking.

The machine ran. The machine said: *The back room is a packaging facility. Import-export businesses have packaging facilities. The cling film and vacuum bags are for moisture protection. The scale is for weight compliance -- shipping companies charge by weight. The charger box is a branded product that Wei packages for distribution. Everything you saw is consistent with a legitimate electronics business.*

The rationalisation was the weakest one the machine had ever produced. It was thin, translucent, the structural equivalent of tissue paper over a hole. Connor could feel its inadequacy. He could feel the wind through it, the cold air of truth moving through the gaps in the tissue, touching his skin with a cold he'd been keeping out for five weeks and could no longer fully exclude.

But the tissue held. Barely. By a thread. By the single thread of *I don't know for certain*, which was the last and most powerful rationalisation of all -- the argument from ignorance, the defence of the man who has seen the evidence and heard the testimony and felt the weight in his hands and still, still, can claim that he doesn't know because he hasn't tested the substance, hasn't read the scale, hasn't held the truth in his palms and said its name aloud.

He walked to Bukit Bintang. The walk took twenty-five minutes through the Saturday crowds -- Petaling Street to Jalan Sultan to Jalan Bukit Bintang, the route threading through the gleaming heart of KL's retail district, past Pavilion and Lot 10, past the monorail station where tourists funnelled out in bright packs, past the Sephora and the H&M and the durian stall that sat among the luxury brands like a dare, pumping its sulfurous, custard-sweet stench into the air-conditioned draft that leaked from every automatic door. The Saturday shoppers moved around him -- families with strollers, Malay teenagers in streetwear, Japanese tour groups following raised umbrellas, Indonesian women in headscarves carrying bags from Zara. The normality of it was obscene. The normality was a wall of sound and colour and human purpose against which Connor moved with a daypack on his back containing a death sentence sitting next to a water bottle and a copy of *The Beach* he'd bought in Bali and never opened past page twelve.

He could feel the box. Not its weight -- 120 grams was nothing, less than a phone, less than a wallet -- but its *presence*, the way you could feel a spider on your arm before you saw it, the way the body registered proximity to danger before the mind had language for it. The box sat in the main compartment of his daypack, cushioned by a rolled-up hoodie, adjacent to the water bottle whose condensation was probably dampening the cellophane wrapper, and the casualness of the arrangement -- a charger box next to a water bottle next to a paperback, the inventory of a tourist's afternoon -- was the most terrifying thing about it. The thing that would kill him was touching the thing that kept him hydrated. The death penalty was nestled against a novel about backpackers in Thailand. The geometry of the daypack was a joke that no one was telling and everyone would eventually understand.

He turned off Jalan Bukit Bintang into a side alley he'd walked once before, nine days ago, on Day 30. The alley was narrow -- barely wide enough for a car -- and the transition from the main road was immediate: the gleaming storefronts vanished, replaced by the back-end infrastructure of the entertainment district, the service doors and dumpsters and stacked crates and the accumulated grime that luxury required but refused to display. Halfway down the alley, on the left, the defunct karaoke bar. The sign was still there -- GOLDEN VOICE KTV -- the neon tubes dark and dusty, the windows papered over from the inside, the roller door pulled down to knee height. The place had the particular stillness of a business that had died and been repurposed without anyone bothering to change the skin.

Connor ducked under the roller door. The interior was dark after the alley's glare, and the darkness smelled of old beer and dust and the chemical residue of whatever cleaning product had last been applied to the vinyl upholstery of the karaoke booths, which were still there, pushed against the walls, their foam cushions split and leaking stuffing. A mirror ball hung from the ceiling, dead, its facets dulled by a film of grime. The room was larger than it looked from outside -- deep, extending back into the building's interior, the rear wall lost in shadow.

Danny was at a table in the back. Mid-twenties, Chinese-Malaysian, thin, the same nervous energy Connor remembered from Day 30, the energy of a man who occupied the disposable middle of a chain and knew it. Danny's face was lit from below by his phone screen, the blue light carving his features into something sharper than they were, and when he looked up at Connor the expression was not greeting or hostility but the flat, transactional blankness of a man who was a function performing his function.

Connor took off the daypack. Unzipped it. Took out the charger box. Placed it on the table. The box sat on the scratched wood between them -- POWERMAX ULTRA FAST CHARGER, the logo cheerful, the cellophane catching a thread of light from the cracked roller door -- and the placing was the act, the handoff, the transfer of 70 grams from one set of hands to another, from one jurisdiction of guilt to another, though the law would not see it that way, the law would see Connor's hands and the 70 grams and the road between them and would draw a line that was straight and final and indifferent to the question of whose table the box was sitting on now.

Danny took it. He didn't weigh it. He didn't open it. He put it in a drawer beneath the table and the drawer closed and the box disappeared and the disappearance was the end of Connor's involvement and the beginning of something else, something that moved down the chain to places and people Connor would never see, and the not-seeing was the last, thinnest wall between him and the full knowledge of what he was part of.

His work phone buzzed. RM500 transferred. The notification produced the familiar pulse -- the small, warm dopamine hit that five weeks of Pavlovian conditioning had wired into his nervous system, the chemical reward for the completed task. But this time the dopamine was fighting something. This time the warmth was competing with a nausea that rose from somewhere lower, somewhere the conditioning hadn't reached, and the two sensations -- the pleasure and the sickness -- coexisted in his chest like two frequencies played simultaneously, producing a dissonance that was not one thing or the other but a third thing, a new thing, the sound of a man who was being rewarded for something that was killing him.

He went home. He sat in the common room. He sat in the armchair where Priya usually sat -- the worn velvet one by the window, the one that smelled faintly of her shampoo, coconut and something herbal -- and he stared at the wall and he thought about nothing, which was the hardest work he'd ever done, because nothing was now full of everything he'd seen and everything he'd refused to know and the space required to hold all of it was larger than his mind and the overflow was leaking into his body, into his chest, into his hands, into the tremor that was no longer internal but visible, his fingers shaking against his thighs in a rhythm that matched the ceiling fan.

The tremor had started in his hands -- the fine, subcutaneous vibration that had been with him in Wei's back room -- but now it spread. It moved up his forearms, into his biceps, into the muscles of his shoulders, the way cold spreads through water, the way a crack spreads through glass, following the lines of least resistance until the whole structure was involved. His hands shook against his thighs. His forearms trembled. His jaw was clenched so tight that his molars ached, the body's attempt to contain the shaking by bracing against itself, which did not work, because the shaking was not muscular but systemic, the full-body response of a nervous system that had been carrying a load it was not designed to carry and had, in the dim back room of a phone repair shop, finally registered the weight.

He stared at the common room. The bookshelf -- the same bookshelf that had been there since his first day, the spines of abandoned paperbacks leaning against each other like drunks at a bar: *Shantaram*, *The Alchemist*, three copies of *Lonely Planet Southeast Asia*, a water-damaged *Harry Potter*. The TV on the wall, playing something in Malay he couldn't follow. The red lanterns hanging from the ceiling, their warm light making everything amber and soft, the light of a place that felt safe because it was designed to feel safe, because the lanterns and the velvet and the bookshelf were the set dressing of a hostel that wanted you to feel at home while you were very, very far from it. And there, beside the reception counter, the noticeboard -- the cork rectangle where Mei Ling pinned bus schedules and tour flyers and house rules, and where, weeks ago, Priya had pinned a printed sheet: the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, Section 39B, the relevant passage highlighted in yellow, the words MANDATORY DEATH PENALTY in bold. The sheet was gone now. Someone had taken it down -- Mei Ling, perhaps, or Uncle Razak, or the natural entropy of a hostel noticeboard that consumed documents the way the building consumed guests, silently, continuously, without record. The sheet was gone but the law was still there, the law was always there, the law did not require a printout to exist.

The machine tried to run. He could feel it trying -- the gears engaging, the mechanism reaching for raw material, the rationalisation engine attempting to convert the back room and the scale and the vacuum bags into something manageable. But the gears found nothing. The gears spun in empty space, producing no traction, no output, no product. The machine had run out of material. The tissue paper was gone. The *I don't know for certain* was gone, burned up in the fluorescent light of Wei's back room where the certainty had been laid out on a stainless steel table like evidence in a courtroom. The machine ran and produced silence, and the silence filled the space where the rationalisations used to be, and the silence was louder than any of them, because silence was the sound of a man who had nothing left to tell himself.

He sat there for an hour. The hour passed the way hours pass in hospital waiting rooms -- not in minutes but in breaths, each breath a unit of time that carried no information and offered no progress, the clock on the wall moving but the situation remaining exactly the same. Guests moved through the common room -- a Dutch couple heading out with daypacks, a solo traveler collecting laundry from the courtyard line -- and none of them saw him, or if they saw him they saw a backpacker sitting in a chair staring at a wall, and that was not unusual, that was not alarming, that was the posture of jet lag or a hangover or a bad night's sleep, the universal hostel posture of a person waiting for something to pass.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

Priya found him there. She came down the narrow staircase from the third floor, her braid over one shoulder, her round glasses pushed up on her forehead the way she wore them when she'd been reading, and she saw his face and she saw his hands and she stopped in the doorway of the common room and stood very still for a moment, the way a person stands when they see something they've been expecting and dreading in equal measure. Then she crossed the room and sat on the arm of the chair and put her hand on his shoulder and said nothing, because sometimes nothing was the right thing to say, the only thing to say, the thing that allowed a person to break in the presence of another person without the breaking being observed or narrated or fixed.

She held him. He let her hold him. And in the holding, in the silence, in the warm amber light of the common room, something gave way. Not the wall -- the wall held, the wall would hold for a few more days, the wall was stronger than love and stronger than fear and stronger than truth. But something behind the wall shifted, the way tectonic plates shift before an earthquake -- a deep, slow, grinding movement that was not yet a break but was the precondition for a break, the mechanical prerequisite for the moment when everything would move at once and the landscape would change and the man who had been carrying packages would become the man who had carried packages, and the difference between the two was everything.

"I went to Wei's shop," Connor said. His voice was quiet. Flat. The voice of a man reporting something he'd seen rather than something he'd done -- the voice of a witness, not a participant, the dissociation already active, the self splitting from the body that had carried the box. "The back room. There's a--" He stopped. Started again. The details came in the wrong order, the way a person describes a car accident -- the aftermath first, then the impact, then the moments before, the chronology scrambled by the force of what had happened. "There's a scale. Digital. Like a kitchen scale but -- no. There's a table first. Stainless steel. And on the table there's cling film and vacuum bags and a vacuum sealer and tape and scissors and-- Priya, there are boxes. Charger boxes. The same boxes. The same--" He stopped again. "It's not a phone shop, Priya."

She held him tighter. Her arms were around his shoulders and the jade bracelet -- the one Connor had bought her at the Petaling Street night market, the one she wore on her left wrist because her mother had told her jade should sit over the pulse -- was cool against his collarbone, and the coolness was the opposite of everything else, the opposite of the fluorescent heat of Wei's back room and the Saturday sun on Bukit Bintang and the warm dopamine of the RM500 notification. Her arms were the temperature of safety and Connor leaned into them the way a drowning man leans into a current that might carry him to shore or might not, the leaning itself the only act available.

"I know," she said.

"I've known for a while. I think I've always known."

"I know that too."

The common room was quiet. The ceiling fans turned. On the TV, a news broadcast in Malay showed footage of a police operation -- officers in blue, a table of seized drugs, a man in handcuffs being led to a van. Connor watched the footage and the footage watched him back.

"What do I do?" he said.

It was the first time he'd asked. In five weeks of warnings and arguments and printed laws and photographs and proverbs and business cards, it was the first time Connor Briggs had looked at someone who loved him and asked for help.

Priya's answer was immediate. She spoke the way she spoke about medicine -- in protocol, in steps, the voice of a fourth-year medical student who had been trained to convert crisis into procedure, to replace panic with sequence, to impose order on the body's chaos. "You stop. Right now. Today. No more deliveries. No more packages. No more Felix."

"And then?"

"And then we call Sergeant Ahmad. You tell him everything -- the routes, the names, the drop points, Wei's shop, the back room. You cooperate fully. Voluntary disclosure before arrest is the strongest position you can be in." She was thinking aloud now, the plan assembling itself in real time, the medical student's mind doing what it was trained to do: triage, prioritise, act. "Then we get to KLIA. Tonight. There's a midnight flight to Melbourne on Malaysia Airlines and a six AM to London on Qatar. We get on whichever one leaves first. You fly to Melbourne, I fly to London, and once we're out of the country you contact the Australian High Commission from outside Malaysian jurisdiction. You tell them everything you told Ahmad. You get a lawyer. A real one, not a hostel recommendation."

The plan was clear. The plan was specific. The plan had five steps and each step was possible and each step led to the next and the final step led to a life in which Connor Briggs was alive and free and answering questions in a room with a lawyer instead of a room with a fluorescent tube and a scale. The plan was the thing that would save his life, the open door at the end of a burning corridor, the exit that was still accessible, still functional, still available to a man who was willing to walk through it.

Connor looked at the door. He looked at Priya. He looked at his hands, which had carried things he'd never opened and were now shaking in the amber light.

"Okay," he said.

Priya's eyes widened. The word -- *okay* -- was the word she'd been waiting for since the night she'd printed the law. The word was yes. The word was agreement. The word was the sound of a man finally, finally, choosing to save himself.

"Okay," she said. "I'll help you. Right now. We'll call Ahmad together."

She reached for her phone. Connor reached for his wallet -- the wallet with the business card, the card that said NARCOTICS DIVISION, the card that was the lifeline, the card that had been waiting.

His burner phone buzzed.

The sound came from his left pocket -- the Nokia, the burner, the work phone, the phone that existed in a parallel jurisdiction from the iPhone in his right pocket. The two phones sat on opposite sides of his body like two identities separated by a spine, the personal and the professional, the curated life and the criminal one, and the buzzing came from the criminal side, the left side, the side closest to his heart, which was a coincidence of pocket placement that felt, in this moment, like architecture.

Felix.

*Need to see you. Rooftop. Now. Important.*

Connor looked at the phone. He looked at Priya. The two options sat before him -- the business card and the burner phone, the lifeline and the chain, the future and the past.

"I should see what he wants," Connor said.

Priya's face changed. The change was not dramatic -- she was not a person who performed her emotions, not a person who widened her eyes or opened her mouth or made the gestures that fear was supposed to make. The change was smaller and worse: a closing. A withdrawal. The light in her eyes -- the specific, fierce, medical light that had been there while she outlined the plan, the light of a person who believed the crisis could be managed -- went out. Replaced by something flat and knowing. The expression of a woman watching someone she loved choose to drown, the expression of a doctor watching a patient refuse treatment, the grief of someone who has offered the cure and watched the hand reach for the poison instead.

"No. Connor. No."

"Just to hear what he has to say. Then I'll call Ahmad. I promise."

"You promise." She said it the way you'd say the name of something that had stopped existing. "Connor, if you go to that rooftop, you won't call Ahmad. You know you won't. You'll talk yourself out of it. You always do. Felix will smile, and you'll find a reason, and tomorrow you'll be carrying another package."

She was right. She was right the way a diagnosis is right -- clinically, absolutely, in a way that the patient can acknowledge intellectually while still refusing to act. Connor knew she was right. He knew it the way he knew the packages weren't phone accessories and the boxes weren't chargers and Felix wasn't a photographer. He knew it, and knowing was not enough, because knowing required action, and action required breaking the only structure he had, and the structure -- the schedule, the money, Felix's approval, the warm, poisonous illusion of belonging -- was the only thing between him and the void.

"Five minutes," he said. "That's all. Then I'll call."

He stood. He put the wallet -- with the card, with the lifeline -- back in his pocket. Right side. He put the burner phone in the other pocket. Left side. The two objects resumed their positions, separated by his body, the choice deferred, the architecture of indecision restored. He walked to the staircase -- the narrow staircase, the one where two people could not pass, the one that funnelled a person upward through the building's dark interior toward the rooftop where Felix waited. The staircase that was too narrow for Priya to follow even if she wanted to, which she didn't, because following was not what you did when someone chose the wrong door. You stood and watched. You stood and watched and you remembered the plan you'd made -- the five steps, the midnight flight, the lawyer, the life -- and you folded it up and put it away in the place where the things that almost happened went to wait.

Priya did not follow. She sat in the armchair and watched him go and felt the fracture between them widen into something she recognised from her orthopaedics rotation -- not a stress fracture anymore but a complete break, the kind where the two halves could not be held together by anything short of surgery, and Connor would not consent to surgery. It had been broken since the first envelope, and everything since had been the two of them standing on opposite sides of the break, reaching across, their fingers almost touching but never quite connecting.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. The rooftop door opened. Felix was there.

And the next chapter began.
