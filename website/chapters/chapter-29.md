# Chapter 29: Running

At three PM on Day 46, Connor Briggs left the Lantern Hostel with his passport in one pocket and RM2,400 in cash in the other and the intention to reach the Thai border before sunrise.

The plan -- if the frantic, half-formed series of decisions that had assembled themselves in the ninety minutes between Felix's room and this moment could be called a plan -- was this: KTM train from KL Sentral to Padang Besar, the border town where the railway crossed from Malaysia into Thailand. The journey was approximately eight hours. If he left now, at three, he'd arrive at Padang Besar by eleven PM. Cross the border on foot -- the land crossing was open until midnight, and the passport control was, according to a blog post he'd found on his phone while sitting on Bed 7 staring at the ceiling, relatively casual on the Malaysian side. Walk into Thailand. Take a bus to Hat Yai. From Hat Yai, another bus to Bangkok. From Bangkok, the Australian Embassy. From the embassy, a flight home. From home, safety.

The plan had the architecture of a fantasy -- each step logical in isolation, the chain of them held together by the same wishful engineering that held together the plans of every desperate person who had ever looked at a map and seen escape as a function of geography rather than circumstance. The plan assumed that Felix did not have contacts at the train station. The plan assumed that the police did not have his name. The plan assumed that the border crossing at Padang Besar was not monitored by the network that Felix operated within, the network that moved methamphetamine between Malaysian cities and had the operational reach to place a man named Rizal in a prison cell at the appropriate time.

The plan assumed many things. Connor was aware of this. He was aware of the plan's fragility in the way that a man climbing a ladder is aware that the ladder is leaning against nothing -- he could feel the wobble, could sense the absence of structural support, could hear the ladder's announcement of its own inadequacy in every creak and shift. But the alternative was the suitcase. The alternative was the eight AM bus to Penang tomorrow morning, the black hard-shell case in the luggage compartment, the five-hour journey through a country that had written his death into its statute books in the specific, unambiguous language of Section 39B, Subsection 2, Dangerous Drugs Act 1952.

The ladder was better than the fall.

---

He walked to KL Sentral. He didn't take a Grab. Taking a Grab left a digital record -- the pickup address, the destination, the timestamp -- and the digital record was evidence, and evidence was the currency that Felix traded in, and Connor had been generating evidence for five weeks with the prodigal generosity of a man who didn't understand the value of what he was giving away.

The walk took forty minutes. Petaling Street to Jalan Sultan, Jalan Sultan to Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, through the covered pedestrian bridge past Pasar Seni, and then the long straight approach to KL Sentral along Jalan Tun Sambanthan, the road that cut through Brickfields -- Little India, where Connor had delivered a package on Day 9, a package that had been heavier than phone accessories, a package that he'd carried through streets that smelled of incense and jasmine and the spices of a neighbourhood that had existed since before the railway and would exist after everyone currently walking its pavements was gone.

The walk was hot. The afternoon heat of KL was a specific kind of hot -- not the dry heat of desert but the humid heat of a city built on a river confluence at three degrees north of the equator, the heat that saturated the air with moisture and turned every surface into a conductor and every step into a negotiation between the body's desire to cool and the atmosphere's refusal to cooperate. Connor sweated. The sweat ran from his hairline into his eyes, from his armpits into the fabric of his grey T-shirt, from the small of his back into the waistband of his board shorts. The sweating was excessive, even for KL -- the excess was the body's commentary on the situation, the physiological expression of the fear that the mind was trying to contain.

He walked through Brickfields. The Indian shops were open -- the flower garlands hanging in doorways, the banana leaf restaurants preparing for the dinner service, the jewellery shops with their gold in glass cases. A temple bell rang somewhere. The sound was clear and high and lasted longer than it should have, the way temple bells did in neighbourhoods where the buildings were old and the acoustics were shaped by decades of sound bouncing off plaster and stone.

He reached KL Sentral at three fifty. The station was a glass and steel cathedral of transit -- the main hub of KL's rail network, the building where KTM, LRT, monorail, and KLIA Transit converged in a nexus of escalators and platforms and the smell of metal and rubber and the collective anticipation of thousands of people going somewhere. The station was busy. The afternoon crowd was a mix of commuters and travellers, the commuters moving with the purposeful efficiency of people who knew where they were going, the travellers moving with the distracted uncertainty of people who didn't.

Connor was neither commuter nor traveller. Connor was a man running, and the running was visible in the way that running was always visible, even when the legs walked -- in the eyes, which moved too quickly, scanning for threats; in the posture, which was simultaneously rigid and hunched, the body trying to be both alert and invisible; in the hands, which checked the passport pocket every thirty seconds with the compulsive regularity of an anxiety that had found a physical expression.

He found the KTM ticket counter. The counter was on the ground floor, next to a 7-Eleven and a currency exchange. The queue was short -- four people ahead of him, two Malay women with shopping bags, a Chinese man in a business suit, an Indian family with two children. The children were arguing about something, their voices sharp and clear in the station's acoustic space, and the argument was about a toy or a seat or the kind of thing that children argued about when the world was still small enough that a toy or a seat could be the most important thing in it.

Connor waited. The queue moved. The ticket counter was manned by a woman in a KTM uniform -- blue shirt, name badge, the neutral expression of a person who had been selling train tickets for long enough that the act had become autonomous, the fingers moving on the keyboard without the mind's participation.

He reached the counter.

"One ticket to Padang Besar, please. Tonight."

The woman typed. The screen reflected in her glasses. She frowned -- a small frown, the kind produced by data rather than emotion.

"Padang Besar. Tonight. The next train is the 6:15 PM ETS -- Electric Train Service. Arrives Padang Besar at 11:47 PM."

"Yes. That one."

She typed more. The frown deepened.

"Coach A is full. Coach B has..." She paused. "One seat. Window. RM74."

"I'll take it."

She looked up. The look was brief -- the professional assessment of a ticket seller evaluating a customer -- and the assessment took in Connor's face, which was sunburnt and tired and carrying the specific quality of a face that had not slept properly in several days, and his clothes, which were the clothes of a backpacker, which was normal in KL Sentral, which was full of backpackers, and his demeanour, which was the demeanour of a man trying very hard to appear normal and thereby appearing the precise opposite of normal.

"Passport," she said.

Connor handed over his passport. The navy blue Australian passport with the kangaroo and the emu. She scanned the photo page. She typed the number into the system. The system processed the number. The system did whatever systems did with passport numbers -- checked them against databases, flagged them against watchlists, compared them to the lists that existed in the servers of the Royal Malaysia Police and the immigration department and the agencies that monitored the movement of foreign nationals through a country that took the monitoring seriously.

The system processed. Connor waited. The waiting was ten seconds. The ten seconds lasted a year.

"RM74," the woman said.

Connor paid in cash. She printed the ticket. She handed it to him with the passport. The ticket was a small rectangle of thermal paper with the route -- KUALA LUMPUR SENTRAL → PADANG BESAR -- and the time -- 18:15 → 23:47 -- and the coach and seat -- B, 14A -- and the date -- today.

He had a ticket. He had a passport. He had RM2,326 remaining. He had two hours and fifteen minutes until the train departed.

He should have felt relief. The ticket was the exit. The ticket was the door that Priya had been trying to push him toward for five weeks -- not the embassy, not the police, not the courtroom, but the simpler exit, the physical exit, the putting-distance-between-yourself-and-the-danger exit. The ticket was a seat on a train that would carry him away from Felix and the suitcase and the bus to Penang and the checkpoint with or without a dog.

He didn't feel relief. He felt the opposite of relief, which was not dread exactly but the specific, paradoxical anxiety of a person who has committed to an escape and is now more afraid than they were before the commitment, because before the commitment the escape was theoretical and theories don't generate adrenaline, but after the commitment the escape was real and reality generated adrenaline in quantities that the body was not designed to process.

He found a bench. He sat. He held the ticket. He checked his phone -- the real phone, not the burner. No messages. No calls. Priya was in the air. His mother's last text was still on the screen: *Hi darling! So glad to hear from you.*

He looked at the departures board. The 6:15 ETS to Padang Besar was listed. Track 3. On time.

Two hours.

---

At four twenty, a man sat down beside him.

The man was Malay. Forties. Stocky, with the broad shoulders and thick neck of a man who had been physically powerful in his twenties and had maintained some of that power through his thirties and forties by means that were not gym memberships. He wore a black T-shirt and jeans and sneakers and a watch that was either an expensive fake or an inexpensive original and the distinction didn't matter because the watch's function was not timekeeping but display -- the display of a man who wanted other men to see his wrist and draw conclusions.

The man sat on the bench. He did not look at Connor. He looked at his phone. He scrolled. The scrolling was casual, unhurried, the scrolling of a man killing time.

Connor looked at him. The look was instinctive -- the evaluation of a nearby body, the threat assessment that the brain performed automatically in environments of stress. The man was not threatening. The man was sitting on a bench in a train station looking at his phone. The man was one of ten thousand men sitting on benches in KL at this moment, doing exactly this thing.

But the man was sitting close. Not inappropriately close -- the bench was long and there were no other seats available and the proximity was explained by the station's afternoon crowd. But close. Close enough that Connor could smell his cologne -- a sharp, chemical scent, the kind sold in small bottles at night market stalls, the kind that announced itself from a metre away and lingered in a space after the wearer had left.

The man scrolled. Connor held his ticket. The station moved around them.

At four twenty-seven, a second man sat on Connor's other side.

This man was younger. Late twenties. Chinese-Malaysian. Thin, wearing a white polo shirt and khaki trousers, the uniform of a man who worked in an office or wanted to look like he did. He carried a backpack -- not a travel backpack but a commuter backpack, small, nylon, the kind that held a laptop and a lunch container and nothing else.

The second man also looked at his phone. The second man also did not look at Connor. The two men on either side of Connor scrolled their phones in the specific, synchronised non-attention of men who were very much paying attention to the person between them.

Connor's body knew before his mind. The body's knowledge arrived as a sensation -- not a thought but a physical event, a tightening of the muscles across his shoulders and down his spine, the body's ancient response to encirclement, to the reduction of escape routes, to the geometry of two bodies positioned on either side of a third body in a way that was casual and deliberate and terrifying.

He looked left. The stocky man scrolled.

He looked right. The thin man scrolled.

He looked forward. The departures board showed the 6:15 to Padang Besar. Track 3. On time.

He could stand up. He could walk to the platform. He could board the train. The ticket was in his hand. The passport was in his pocket. The platform was fifty metres away, through the turnstiles, down the escalator, across the concourse. Fifty metres was thirty seconds of walking. Thirty seconds was nothing. Thirty seconds was the time it took to reach the platform and board a train that would carry him to the border and to Thailand and to safety.

He stood up.

The stocky man stood up. Not simultaneously -- a second later, the delay calculated to appear coincidental, the way a shadow's movement appeared coincidental to the body's, the shadow rising because the body rose, the relationship causal but denied.

Connor took a step. The thin man stood up. The same delay. The same coincidence.

Connor stopped.

He was standing in KL Sentral with a train ticket to freedom in his hand and two men flanking him like brackets around a word, and the word was his name, and the brackets were the network, and the network had known -- had known before Connor knew, before the plan formed, before the forty-minute walk through Brickfields and the ticket counter and the thermal paper rectangle that said PADANG BESAR. The network had known because the network monitored, because Wei's cameras recorded, because the hostel's geography funnelled all exits through a single door and the door was watched, and the watching was not a person standing and looking but a system that registered movement and reported deviation and dispatched response with the mechanical efficiency of a machine that had been built to prevent exactly this -- the mule's last-minute attempt to bolt.

The stocky man was on his left. One metre. The thin man was on his right. One metre. The geometry was symmetrical, professional, the spacing of men who had done this before and knew the distance that communicated control without attracting attention.

"Connor."

The voice came from behind him. The voice was Malay-accented English, male, calm. Not a voice he recognised. He turned.

A third man. Standing three metres back. Older than the other two -- fifties, grey at the temples, wearing a batik shirt in blue and green, the formal-casual attire of a man who occupied a position that allowed him to choose his own wardrobe. His face was unremarkable -- the kind of face that disappeared into crowds, that was designed by genetics or training or both to resist description, to be forgotten the moment you looked away.

"Felix asked me to give you a message," the man said.

The man reached into his pocket. Connor flinched -- the flinch of a body expecting a weapon, the flinch that the body produced without the mind's permission. But what the man produced was not a weapon. It was a phone. He held it up. The screen was facing Connor.

On the screen, a photo. The photo showed a living room -- Connor's parents' living room. The room he'd grown up in, in Hawthorn, Melbourne. The room with the cream leather sofa and the framed family photos on the mantelpiece and the bay window that looked onto the garden where his father had taught him to kick a football. The photo was recent -- taken through the bay window from outside, the glass reflecting the photographer's flash, the room visible through the reflection, and in the room, on the sofa, his mother. Karen Briggs. Sitting with a cup of tea. Watching television. The photo was taken from outside. From the garden. From the perspective of someone standing in his parents' garden in Hawthorn, Melbourne, at a distance of approximately three metres, looking through a window at his mother.

Connor's legs stopped working.

Not collapsed -- the legs didn't buckle, the knees didn't fail, the body didn't fall. The legs simply stopped. The signals from the brain that instructed the muscles to fire and the joints to flex and the body to move were interrupted, diverted, re-routed to a process that was larger and more urgent than locomotion, the process of absorbing the information that the photo contained.

Felix had someone at his parents' house. Felix had someone who knew where his parents lived, who had stood in their garden, who had photographed his mother through a window. Felix's network extended not just across KL and not just across Malaysia but across the world, to Melbourne, to Hawthorn, to the cream leather sofa where Karen Briggs sat with her tea unaware that a man with a phone was standing in her garden documenting her existence as leverage against her son, twelve thousand kilometres away, in a train station, holding a ticket to the Thai border.

"Felix says the bus is at eight AM tomorrow," the man said. His voice was conversational, pleasant almost, the voice of a man delivering a routine message. "He says you should go back to the hostel and get some rest. He says the train to Padang Besar is not part of the plan."

The man put the phone back in his pocket. He nodded -- a small, polite nod, the nod of a man concluding a business interaction. He turned and walked away. His batik shirt disappeared into the crowd. The stocky man and the thin man also walked away, in different directions, absorbed by the station's afternoon population, dissolved into the mass of commuters and travellers who were going somewhere because they could, because their destinations were chosen and their journeys were voluntary and their arrivals were not appointments with death.

Connor stood alone.

The ticket was in his hand. The train was at six fifteen. Track 3. Fifty metres. Thirty seconds.

His mother's face was in his mind. The cream sofa. The cup of tea. The bay window. The photographer in the garden.

He looked at the ticket. The thermal paper was slightly damp from his palm, the printing beginning to blur at the edges where the moisture met the ink. KUALA LUMPUR SENTRAL → PADANG BESAR. The route to freedom. The route to the Thai border. The route that Felix had anticipated and blocked, not with violence, not with physical restraint, but with a photograph -- a single photograph of a woman on a sofa, the most effective prison ever built, the prison of a son's love for his mother, the love that was the only thing in Connor's architecture that the machine had not processed, the one structural element that could not be rationalised or denied or ignored.

He tore the ticket in half. The two halves fell to the station's tiled floor. A cleaner in a yellow vest would find them later and sweep them into a dustpan and deposit them in a bin and the bin would be emptied into a truck and the truck would carry the ticket to a landfill and the ticket would decompose and the route it described -- Kuala Lumpur to Padang Besar, freedom to the border -- would disappear from the physical world, though it would remain in the KTM booking system as a no-show, a seat that was sold and not occupied, a ghost in the railway's data.

Connor walked back through KL Sentral. Past the ticket counter, past the 7-Eleven, past the currency exchange, past the families and the commuters and the travellers. Past the turnstiles. Past the glass doors. Into the afternoon heat of Brickfields, where the temple bell was still ringing or was ringing again, the sound clear and high and lasting longer than it should have.

He walked back to Petaling Street. The walk took forty minutes. The same route, reversed. The same heat, the same sweat, the same streets. But the walk was different now because the man walking was different -- the man who had walked to KL Sentral had been a man with a plan, a man with an exit, a man who believed that geography could solve what circumstance had created. The man walking back was a man without a plan, without an exit, a man who understood that the trap was not geographical but total, not located in a building or a city but in the network of leverage and surveillance and threat that Felix had built around him with the patience and precision of a man who had done this before and would do it again.

The walk back was the walk of a man returning to his cell.

---

The hostel was quiet when he arrived. The afternoon lull -- the time between checkout and the evening's social energy, the time when the building rested and the fans turned and the red lanterns glowed for no one. The common room was empty. The kitchen was clean. Mama Siti was gone -- her shift ended at two, and the kitchen became, in her absence, a space that was merely functional rather than alive, a room with appliances rather than a room with a cook, the difference being the difference between a house and a home.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. He reached the second-floor landing and stopped.

Uncle Razak was there.

Razak was standing in the corridor outside Dorm 3, leaning against the wall with the posture of a man who had been waiting. He wore his usual attire -- the batik shirt, the reading glasses pushed onto his forehead, the expression of a man who had seen more than he wanted to see and was now in the process of deciding how much of what he'd seen he was willing to act on.

"Connor."

"Uncle Razak."

Razak straightened. He was not a tall man -- five seven, five eight -- but he had the compressed authority of a man who owned the building and had owned it for seventeen years and the owning was not just a legal fact but a physical one, the building responding to his presence the way a ship responded to its captain, the creaks and settlings modulating, the atmosphere adjusting.

"Come," Razak said. "My office."

Connor followed. Razak's office was on the ground floor, behind reception, through a door that was usually locked. Connor had been in the office once -- on Day 11, when Razak had shown him the map, the red pins, the newspaper clippings, the collected record of deaths in hostels worldwide. The map of the dead.

The office was unchanged. The clippings covered the walls -- yellowed newspaper articles, printed web pages, handwritten notes. The map was on the far wall, the large world map with its red pins, each pin a death, each death a story, each story ending in the same place: a building designed for temporary occupancy, a guest who became permanent in the wrong way.

Razak closed the door. He sat behind his desk. The desk was covered in papers -- invoices, booking records, the administrative debris of a business that functioned on the border between hospitality and complicity.

"Sit," Razak said.

Connor sat. The chair was old -- wooden, the seat worn smooth by years of use.

"I know what Felix is asking you to do," Razak said.

The sentence was delivered without preamble, without the gradual approach that most people used when addressing difficult subjects, without the circumlocution and the euphemism and the careful, cowardly navigation of uncomfortable truths. Razak said it the way he said everything -- directly, with the economy of a man who had learned that indirect language was a luxury afforded to people who had time, and time was the one thing they did not have.

"I've known what Felix does since he arrived," Razak continued. "Eighteen months ago. He came to the hostel and he asked for a private room and he paid in cash and he stayed. Weeks. Months. He paid above rate. He was quiet, polite, clean. He didn't cause trouble. He didn't bring trouble into the building. Not at first."

Razak opened a drawer. He took out a folder -- Manila, worn, the kind of folder that contained documents someone had been collecting for a long time. He placed it on the desk.

"I made an arrangement with Felix. An arrangement I am not proud of. The arrangement was this: he could operate from the building as long as he followed rules. No drugs in the hostel. No recruitment of staff. No violence. No attention from the police. The hostel remained clean. The hostel's name remained clean. The guests remained safe."

He opened the folder. Inside: papers, photographs, printouts. Connor could see the edge of a photograph -- a woman, young, blonde, the partial image of a face he didn't recognise.

"The arrangement held for a year. And then Felix started recruiting guests."

Razak's voice changed -- not louder, not angrier, but thicker, heavier, the voice acquiring the weight of something that had been carried for months and was now being set down.

"The first one was a girl from Sweden. Lena. Twenty-two. She was in Bed 7. Your bed."

Connor's body went still. The stillness was not the stillness of calm but the stillness of collision -- the body's response to the impact of information that confirmed what he already knew but had not heard spoken aloud by someone who was not Felix, not Priya, not himself.

"Lena stayed for six weeks. She carried packages for Felix. The same packages you carry. The same routes, the same contacts, the same schedule. She was arrested at the border crossing at Bukit Kayu Hitam, near the Thai border. She had two hundred grams of methamphetamine in a bag. She is now in Kajang Prison. She is awaiting trial. The charge is trafficking. The sentence, if convicted, is death."

Razak paused. The pause was not dramatic but necessary -- the pause of a man who needed to breathe before continuing, the pause of a body managing the physical cost of speaking the truth.

"I did nothing. When Lena was arrested, I did nothing. I told myself that the arrangement was still in place, that Felix had broken the rules, that I would end the arrangement. But I didn't end it. Felix paid. The hostel needed the money. I needed the money. And so the arrangement continued, and Felix recruited another mule -- not from this hostel, from another building, a guesthouse in Bukit Bintang -- and the mule was arrested and the mule is also in Kajang and the arrangement continued because the arrangement was easier than the alternative and the alternative was the police and the police would ask questions about the arrangement and the questions would lead to answers that would end me."

He looked at Connor. The look was not the flat assessment of previous encounters -- not the ex-businessman's calculating gaze, not the hostel owner's professional evaluation. The look was something else. Something older. Something that might, in a man who was less damaged by his own complicity, have been called shame.

"And now you," Razak said. "And now a suitcase. And now I am sitting in my office looking at the next pin on my map and the pin is a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in my building and the pin is tomorrow unless someone does something and the someone is me because there is no one else."

"What can you do?" Connor said.

"I can call the police."

"Felix has the footage. My fingerprints. My--"

"I know what Felix has. I also know what Felix doesn't have. Felix doesn't have a cooperative witness. Felix doesn't have a hostel owner willing to testify about an eighteen-month arrangement. Felix doesn't have Mei Ling's records -- the checkout forms, the booking logs, the dates that match Felix's tenancy with the arrests of mules from this address. Felix doesn't have Tomoko's photographs -- and yes, I know about the photographs, and I know Felix stole the camera, and I know the photographs are backed up to a cloud server because Tomoko told me so three weeks ago."

The information arrived in Connor's mind like a sequence of lights turning on in a dark building -- each fact illuminating a space he hadn't known existed, each fact revealing that the building around him was larger and more complex than the single corridor he'd been walking, that there were other rooms, other people, other stories running parallel to his.

"Tomoko backed up the photos."

"Tomoko is a journalist. Journalists back up everything. The camera was bait -- she let Felix take it because the camera was empty. The real photographs are on a server in Tokyo. She's been waiting to use them."

"Waiting for what?"

"Waiting for someone to cooperate. Photographs without testimony are evidence but not a story. A story requires a voice. Tomoko needs a voice."

"My voice."

"Your voice."

Connor sat in the old wooden chair in Razak's office and looked at the map on the wall and the pins that marked the dead and the space on the map where Kuala Lumpur was, where the pin for the Lantern Hostel would go, where his name would join the list of guests who checked in and never checked out.

"If I cooperate," Connor said. "If I go to the police, or to Ahmad, or to the embassy. Felix has someone in Melbourne. At my parents' house. He showed me a photograph of my mother."

Razak's expression did not change. The information about Melbourne, about the photograph, about the network's reach into Connor's family home -- the information was received and processed by a man who had learned, over eighteen months of the arrangement, to not be surprised by Felix's capabilities.

"Felix's network is not as large as Felix wants you to believe," Razak said. "A photograph through a window is not a man with a weapon. A camera in a garden is not an operation. Felix uses fear the way he uses money -- precisely, economically, at the exact amount required to achieve compliance. The photograph of your mother is not a threat to your mother. It's a threat to your perception. It's designed to make you believe that running is impossible and compliance is the only option."

"How do you know?"

"Because the same photograph was shown to Lena. And to the mule after Lena. The photograph changes -- different house, different parent, different window. The technique is the same. It's a tool. Like the burner phone. Like the CCTV footage. Like the money."

Connor sat with this. The information rearranged something in his mind -- not the fear, which remained, but the architecture of the fear, the structure that Felix had built around it. The structure was not a fortress. The structure was a stage set. The walls were not concrete but painted canvas. The locks were not steel but theatrical props. The fear was real but the infrastructure of the fear was performance -- Felix's most sophisticated product, more valuable than the methamphetamine, more carefully manufactured than the vacuum-sealed bags in Wei's back room.

"What do I do?" Connor said.

"Tomorrow morning. Before eight. Before the bus. You go to Dang Wangi. You ask for Sergeant Ahmad. You tell him everything. I will call Ahmad tonight and tell him you're coming. Tomoko will send her photographs to The Star newspaper at the same time. Mei Ling will provide the hostel records. And the letter that Priya is carrying to London will arrive as confirmation, not as the first report."

The plan was different from Priya's plan. Priya's plan had been the embassy -- the safe option, the diplomatic option, the option that placed Connor under the protection of his own country's bureaucracy. Razak's plan was the police -- the dangerous option, the option that placed Connor directly into the system that would charge him, the option that trusted Ahmad to be clean, to be competent, to be the officer that his business card said he was.

"Ahmad is clean," Razak said, reading Connor's face. "I've known Ahmad for fifteen years. He's Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi district. He's been watching Felix for six months. He doesn't have enough for an arrest -- Felix is careful, the evidence is on the mules, not on the handler. But a cooperating witness changes the calculus. A cooperating witness is the thing Ahmad needs."

"And if he's not clean?"

"Then we are all destroyed. You, me, Mei Ling, Tomoko. The building. Everything. If Ahmad is not clean, then the system is too broken for any of us to survive, and the question of whether you carry the suitcase or don't carry the suitcase is irrelevant because the system will find you either way."

The assessment was brutal and honest, delivered with the flat clarity of a man who had calculated the odds and accepted them. Razak was gambling -- gambling on Ahmad, gambling on the system, gambling on the possibility that the mechanism that had failed Lena might not fail Connor.

"Think about it," Razak said. "Tonight. You have until seven AM. After seven, Felix will give you the suitcase. After the suitcase, the options narrow. Before the suitcase, they're still open."

He stood. The conversation was over. The folder on the desk remained open -- the photographs, the documents, the collected evidence of eighteen months of complicity that Razak was now preparing to trade for something that might be redemption or might be destruction.

"One more thing," Razak said.

Connor looked at him.

"The name on your bed frame. Lena. She carved it with a coin. The night before her last delivery. She told me she wanted someone to know she'd been there."

The information was not new -- Connor had known about the name since the air well, since the night he'd sat on the tile bench and thought about carving his own name. But hearing it from Razak -- from the man who had let Lena sleep in Bed 7 and carry packages and be arrested and said nothing -- hearing it from the man who was trying to not let the same thing happen again -- the hearing was different from the knowing, the way testimony was different from suspicion, the way a spoken truth occupied a different space in the mind than an inferred one.

Connor left Razak's office. He climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked.

---

He lay in Bed 7. The dorm was empty. The afternoon light came through the air well, softer now, the tropical light beginning its evening descent from white to gold to the deep amber that preceded the dark. The ceiling fan turned. The name was under his palm on the bed frame. L-E-N-A.

Two options. Two doors.

Door one: the suitcase. Eight AM. The bus. The five-hour journey to Penang. The checkpoint that might have a dog. The delivery. The RM10,000. The freedom that Felix promised, which was not freedom but the extension of a leash, the lengthening of a chain that would remain attached no matter how far he walked.

Door two: Dang Wangi. Seven AM. Ahmad. The confession. The charge. The cell. The trial. The system that might distinguish between a mule and a dealer, or might not. The system that had killed Lena -- no, not killed, was killing, was in the process of killing, the legal system's particular form of slow killing, the killing that took months and years and appeals and the waiting was its own form of death.

Two doors. One led to a bus. One led to a police station. Both led to places where a blue travel towel would be irrelevant because the places he was going didn't have beaches or showers or the kind of morning that required a towel.

He closed his eyes. The ceiling fan turned. The name pressed against his palm.

Tomorrow. Seven AM or eight AM. Dang Wangi or TBS. Ahmad or the bus. The badge or the suitcase.

The countdown had reached its final digit.

*Tick.*
