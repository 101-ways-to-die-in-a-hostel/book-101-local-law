# Chapter 5: Content Creator

---

The laptop screen had gone to sleep again. Connor tapped the trackpad, watched the login prompt bloom to life, and typed his password -- *balivibes69* -- with the grim efficiency of a man performing surgery on his own ambitions. The screen unlocked to reveal exactly what he'd left twenty minutes ago: an open Google Doc with three lines of text, an Instagram scheduling dashboard, and seventeen browser tabs he would never revisit.

The cafe was called Grind Culture. Of course it was. It occupied the ground floor of a pre-war shophouse on Jalan Sultan, two streets over from The Lantern, and it had been gutted and rebuilt in the image of every third-wave coffee temple from Brooklyn to Byron Bay. Exposed brick. Edison bulbs. A chalkboard menu in deliberately imperfect handwriting. Pour-over stations gleaming like laboratory equipment. The whole place smelled of single-origin Sumatran and the unspoken agreement that everyone here was doing something important on their MacBooks.

He adjusted his man-bun, sipped his flat white -- RM14, which his brain helpfully converted to about five Australian dollars, which his bank balance helpfully pointed out he didn't have -- and surveyed the room.

Six other laptops open. Three looked like genuine developers, deep in code, headphones on, the thousand-yard stare of people wrestling with something that would actually compile. One was a girl with a ring light clipped to her screen, recording a whispered podcast into her AirPods. One was typing what appeared to be an actual manuscript. And one -- the only one who met Connor's gaze -- was watching a cooking video with the sound off.

*Probably actually working*, Connor thought, casting his eyes over the developers. *Mugs.*

He returned to the Google Doc. The three lines read:

> Hey legends!! Your weekend vibes are about to get INSANE. New boards dropping next week from our mates at Pacific Soul -- crafted by shapers who live and breathe the Byron break. Link in bio for 10% off. Catch the wave or watch it from shore. Your call.

That was Caption One. For Pacific Soul Surf Co. of Byron Bay, New South Wales, Australia. His one client. His single, solitary source of earned income. One hundred and fifty American dollars a month for three Instagram posts a week, scheduled in advance, each one requiring approximately four minutes of effort and a stock photo Connor pulled from Unsplash with "surf lifestyle" in the search bar.

He'd told Pacific Soul he was a "content strategist" with "a network of over five thousand engaged followers." Three lies wrapped in marketing jargon, offered with a confidence that functioned exactly like competence until someone checked. No one ever checked. The whole infrastructure ran on trust and vibes.

Connor copied Caption One into the scheduling dashboard, assigned it a stock photo of a blonde woman holding a surfboard at sunset, and set the publish time for 7 AM AEST.

Caption Two came faster:

> Monday doesn't have to be a wipeout. Grab your board, grab your crew, and ride into the new week like you mean it. Pacific Soul -- where every day is a swell day. #surflife #byronbay #pacificsoul #mondaymotivation

*Where every day is a swell day.* Christ. He was writing puns for a surf shop while the humidity of equatorial Southeast Asia liquefied his will to live. But it was technically work, in a technical sense, if you squinted.

Caption Three: something about life being too short, riding bad boards, chasing dreams. He didn't think about it. He published all three, closed the tab, and felt the warm glow of accomplishment that a man feels when he has performed the absolute minimum required to justify his existence. Three captions. Fifteen minutes. That was his work for the day.

Now came the real work. The Work of Connor.

He turned the laptop sideways, pulled his phone from his pocket, and photographed his flat white from above. Not right. The foam pattern -- some vaguely leaf-shaped thing the barista had scratched out -- was off-centre in the frame. He adjusted the cup a quarter turn. Shot again. Better. But the light was wrong. He shifted the laptop to create a negative space in the background, a clean wooden surface with the cafe's logo just visible on a napkin. Third shot.

That was the one.

He opened VSCO, applied a preset -- *C1, always C1, the thinking man's filter* -- and pulled the exposure up a touch. Warmed the tones. The flat white now looked like an artifact from a better life than the one he was actually living. He switched to Instagram, typed a caption:

> Office for the day. No walls, no ceiling, no limits. Just me, my laptop, and the best flat white in KL. This is what they don't tell you about the digital nomad life -- every day is different, every cafe is a new perspective.
>
> #digitalnomad #remotework #laptoplifestyle #kualalumpur #KL #coffeeshop #livingmybestlife #nooffice #workfromanywhere #flatwhite #cafecrawl #contentcreator

Twelve hashtags. Connor considered this restrained. He'd read somewhere that the algorithm preferred under fifteen. He posted.

Then he sat back and watched the likes trickle in. One. Two. A pause. Three. The dopamine was barely perceptible, the serotonin equivalent of licking the foil lid of a yoghurt container. But it was something. A pulse. A proof of life.

He checked his follower count: 4,207. Down three from yesterday. That was about five K, give or take. If anyone asked. Some of them were bots, and some of them were his mum's friends, and some of them were other digital nomads following him purely so he'd follow back, a daisy chain of mutual delusion stretching around the globe. But five K sounded like a man with a brand.

He opened LinkedIn on a whim. Scrolled past posts from people his age in Melbourne -- someone promoted to Associate Director, someone launching a startup, a girl from school celebrating her third anniversary at Google. Connor's own profile listed him as "Digital Nomad | Content Strategist | Global Citizen" and hadn't been updated in eleven months. He began drafting a thought-leadership post:

> The future of remote work isn't an office without walls. It's a mindset without borders. For the last four years, I've been living proof that you don't need a corner office or a zip code to build something meaningful. You just need wifi, a willingness to embrace uncertainty, and the

He stopped. The sentence had nowhere to go. He didn't know what you needed. He didn't know if he'd built anything meaningful. He didn't even know what the wifi password was this week. He closed LinkedIn and reopened Instagram and scrolled through other people's curated lives until the flat white went cold and the guilt became load-bearing.

The walk back to The Lantern took four minutes down Jalan Sultan to Petaling Street, past the textile shops and the traditional medicine stores. The heat had settled into its midday configuration -- not the morning heat, which was merely uncomfortable, but the lunchtime heat, which was a statement of intent. His singlet was soaked through before he'd gone half a block.

He passed Wei's shop. Phone repairs. A narrow glass frontage crammed with charging cables and screen protectors and handwritten signs in Mandarin and English: REPAIR 30 MIN, UNLOCK ANY PHONE, WE FIX WATER DAMAGE. A man sat behind the counter, head down, soldering something under a magnifying lamp. Connor walked past it the way he walked past everything in KL that didn't photograph well: without seeing it.

Back at the hostel, Connor climbed the narrow staircase to Dorm 3, the third step squeaking under his flip-flop, and dropped onto Bed 7. The ceiling fan rotated above him with the weary commitment of something that had given up on making a difference but hadn't technically stopped trying.

He opened his banking app.

The number sat there on the screen, small and plain and devastating. RM 847.23. He stared at it the way a man stares at a medical result that confirms his suspicions. Then he closed the app. Then he opened it again, as if the number might have changed in the interim -- a digital miracle, a banking glitch in his favour, a misplaced decimal that would reveal he actually had RM 8,472.30 and everything was fine.

RM 847.23.

His parents' next deposit was ten days away. Two thousand Australian dollars, which converted to roughly RM 5,800 at current rates. That money would land in his account on the twenty-first and he would feel the hot relief of reprieve, the way a drowning man feels when the wave recedes and leaves him gasping on the sand. But the twenty-first was ten days away. And RM 847 divided by ten days was RM 84.70 per day.

Connor did the maths, which was not a thing Connor typically did, which was itself a measure of how serious this had become. RM 84.70 a day. His hostel bed was RM 35. That left RM 49.70 for food, transport, and everything else.

RM 49.70 per day was survivable if he ate exclusively at hawker stalls. Nasi lemak from the aunty on Jalan Tun H.S. Lee, RM 5. Roti canai from the mamak stall on the corner, RM 2.50. Rice and a curry from any of the twenty places within stumbling distance of The Lantern, RM 8. He could eat three meals a day for under RM 20 if he abandoned every pretence of the lifestyle he photographed for Instagram.

No more RM 14 flat whites at Grind Culture. No more RM 18 avocado toast. No more RM 30 cocktails at the rooftop bar on Changkat where Felix had taken them two nights ago. No going out. The thought arrived with the weight of a prison sentence -- sitting in the hostel every evening while everyone else disappeared into the neon maze of the city and came back at 2 AM with stories and hangovers and the flushed contentment of people who could afford to be young.

Connor rolled over on the thin mattress and considered his options. There were four. There were always four.

Option A: Ask his parents for more money. His thumb hovered over his mother's contact. He could hear the conversation already. "Of course, darling, I'll talk to your father." And she would. And David Briggs would transfer the money, because David Briggs loved his son in the helpless, exasperated way of a man who understood that cutting the cord would require a conversation neither of them was ready for. But Megan would find out. Megan always found out. His sister had a forensic accountant's attention to the family finances and a prosecutor's enthusiasm for cross-examination. "He's twenty-seven, Mum. I was supporting myself at twenty-three. He's taking the piss." Connor could hear Megan's voice as clearly as if she were in the dorm. He put his phone down.

Option B: Get a real remote job. He'd considered this before, usually at 3 AM after three beers. He would learn web development. Or graphic design. Or real copywriting. He'd sign up for a course, build a portfolio, join the ranks of the genuinely location-independent.

The problem was sequential. To get a remote job, he needed a portfolio. To build a portfolio, he needed skills. To acquire skills, he needed discipline. And discipline was the one resource Connor had never possessed, not in twenty-seven years of life.

Option C: Go home.

The thought entered his mind the way a kidney stone enters the urinary tract -- unwelcome, excruciating, and impossible to ignore once it had arrived. Go home. Back to Melbourne. Back to Hawthorn. Back to his old bedroom with the posters of bands he didn't listen to anymore, back to his father's careful questions about "next steps," back to the brunch circuit with his parents' friends asking "So what are you up to now, Connor?" with the gentle concern of people addressing a terminal patient. Back to watching Megan and his mates continue their march through the milestones of adult life -- promotions, mortgages, engagements, babies -- while he stood on the platform wondering which train he was supposed to catch.

Going home meant admitting that the last four years had been an extended holiday funded by his parents. Going home meant admitting that "digital nomad" was a costume, not an identity.

The thought was physically revolting, like swallowing broken glass. He felt his chest tighten and his jaw clench, and he knew, with the certainty of a man who has confused cowardice for freedom, that he would rather starve in Southeast Asia than prosper in Melbourne.

Which left Option D.

Felix's offer. RM 200 for twenty minutes. Logistics. He'd done it twice already -- the envelope, the package to Brickfields -- and both times had been smooth, easy, weightless. If he did it once a day, that was RM 6,000 a month. More than his parents gave him. Enough to stay. Enough to live, properly, the way he pretended to on Instagram. Enough to buy Priya dinner at that Japanese place she'd mentioned.

He caught himself calculating. The numbers tumbled through his mind with the frictionless ease of a slot machine. RM 200 a day, seven days a week, RM 1,400 a week, enough for a private room, enough for flights to the next country, enough for --

He put his phone face-down on the mattress. The fan turned above him. Someone in the next dorm was playing lo-fi beats from a tinny speaker, the universal soundtrack of people pretending to be relaxed.

*She'll be right*, Connor thought. Then, less certainly: *She'll be right.*

He ordered another coffee at Grind Culture. RM 14. Because the cafe had aircon and the alternative was the hostel's common room, where the ceiling fan stirred the humidity into a warm soup. The barista made a better leaf pattern this time. Connor didn't photograph it. Progress, or exhaustion. Hard to tell.

---

Priya was already at the Pasar Seni LRT station when Connor arrived, forty minutes late, wearing the same board shorts from yesterday and a singlet that said GOOD VIBES ONLY in a font that suggested the vibes were, in fact, compulsory.

"You're late," she said, pushing her round glasses up her nose in the way that Connor found annoyingly endearing.

"I'm on island time."

"We're not on an island."

"It's a state of mind, Priya."

She looked at him with the expression she reserved for his more philosophical contributions -- part amusement, part despair, the face of a woman who was attracted to a man she couldn't fully respect and was negotiating the distance between the two.

"Come on," she said. "It's this way."

The train to Batu Caves took thirty minutes. Connor had never heard of the place until Priya mentioned it that morning in the hostel kitchen, while he was failing to operate the rice cooker and she was reading her battered Lonely Planet.

"Hindu temple complex in a limestone cave. Two hundred and seventy-two steps. Monkeys. A massive golden statue."

"Is there wifi?"

"Connor."

"Joking. Mostly. Yeah, sounds sick. Let's do it."

He'd agreed partly because she'd asked, and partly because he had nothing else to do that didn't cost money, and partly because there was a quality to Priya's enthusiasm that made resistance feel churlish.

The train deposited them at a station that opened directly onto the base of the caves, and Connor's first thought was that his phone camera was not going to be enough for this.

The limestone cliff rose up from the earth like the jawbone of something impossibly ancient, grey-white and sheer, jungle-draped at its crown. At its base, a golden statue stood guard -- Lord Murugan, Priya told him, the Hindu god of war, forty-two metres tall, its surface blazing in the afternoon sun so intensely that Connor had to squint.

"Forty-two metres," Priya said, tilting her head back. "Tallest Murugan statue in the world. Three hundred litres of gold paint."

"Where do you even buy three hundred litres of gold paint?"

She laughed. She had a good laugh -- unstudied, a little too loud, the laugh of someone who hadn't yet learned to perform her own amusement. He found himself smiling back in a way that felt genuine and slightly dangerous.

The 272 steps were painted in the colours of a rainbow -- red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, repeating in bands up the face of the cliff, as though someone had dropped a paintbox from the top and let gravity do the work. Tourists and pilgrims streamed up and down in a mixed current of devotion and breathlessness, pausing to photograph each other, to pray, to gasp, to buy water from the vendors stationed at strategic intervals like aid stations on a marathon course.

The monkeys were everywhere. Long-tailed macaques with the confidence of old-money aristocrats and the morals of pickpockets, perched on railings and tourists' shoulders, watching the procession with amber eyes that missed nothing. Connor saw one steal a water bottle from an elderly woman's bag with surgical precision. Another sat on the rainbow steps eating a mango, regarding the humans below with the tolerant contempt of a creature that had never needed to invent the concept of a job.

"Don't show them your phone," Priya warned, grabbing his wrist as he raised it for a photo. "They'll take it."

"What, the monkeys?"

"They grab shiny things. There are signs everywhere, Connor."

There were signs everywhere. Connor hadn't read them.

They climbed. The heat was a living thing on the exposed staircase -- direct equatorial sun on painted concrete, no shade until the cave mouth above. Connor's flip-flops slapped on the steps. Priya, in sensible trainers, kept a steady pace, her braid swinging against her back like a metronome. He watched her climb and thought about things he hadn't thought about in a while -- not sex, which he thought about constantly, but something quieter. Something that didn't have a hashtag.

The cave mouth swallowed them like a throat.

Inside, the temperature dropped -- the limestone breathing its stored chill into the trapped air. The cavern opened up and Connor stopped walking because his brain needed a moment to accommodate the scale. The cave chamber was the size of a cathedral, the ceiling a hundred feet overhead, stalactites hanging like the pipes of an organ, light pouring in through gaps in the rock in dusty golden shafts that illuminated a Hindu shrine -- draped in garlands of marigolds and jasmine, attended by priests in white, surrounded by incense smoke and the quiet murmur of prayer.

"Bloody hell," Connor said.

Priya didn't correct his language. She was looking up, her glasses reflecting the shafts of light, and her face had the openness of someone standing in the presence of something they took seriously.

They sat on a low wall at the edge of the chamber. Below them, the stairs cascaded down to the green suburban sprawl of Selangor. Above them, the cave ceiling dripped with mineral deposits that had taken a hundred million years to form. The air smelled of wet stone and incense and the faint green rot of jungle. A priest chanted somewhere nearby, the words rising and falling in a cadence that felt older than the rock itself.

Connor's phone was in his pocket. He didn't take it out. He wasn't sure why. The light was good. The content was exceptional. But something about the cave -- the scale, the silence, the weight of all that time frozen in limestone -- made performing his own experience feel small.

"It's nice here," he said, and then winced at the inadequacy of the word.

"It's been a sacred site for thousands of years," Priya said. "People have been climbing those steps to pray for longer than most countries have existed."

"And now there's a bloke in board shorts sitting in the middle of it wondering if his flat white was tax-deductible."

She looked at him. "Is that what you're wondering?"

"No." He picked at the leather bracelet on his wrist. The full moon party bracelet. He'd had it so long it was part of his body now, a second skin he'd grown in Thailand and never shed. "I don't know what I'm wondering. That's sort of the problem."

Priya waited. She was good at waiting. It was a quality that Connor found unnerving -- the patience of someone who listened not to respond but to understand. Most people Connor talked to were just waiting for their turn to speak. Priya waited like a doctor waits for a patient to describe the pain.

"Everyone back home has a job," he said. "A mortgage. A plan. Megan -- my sister -- she's an accountant. My mates are buying houses. Dave got engaged last month. Simmo's having a kid. And I'm..." He gestured vaguely at the cave, at the stairs, at the general concept of Southeast Asia. "I'm here. I'm twenty-seven and I'm here."

"What's wrong with here?"

"Nothing. Everything. I don't know." He laughed, but there was nothing behind it. A laugh without fuel. "Here is amazing. Here is a cave with a temple in it and monkeys that steal your phone. Here is incredible. But here isn't a plan, is it? Here isn't something you put on a CV. Here isn't..." He trailed off. The incense drifted past them. A child ran by, chasing a macaque, both of them shrieking. "Here isn't real life. That's what my dad says, anyway. 'When are you going to start your real life, Con?' Like this is the rehearsal."

"Maybe it is," Priya said. Not unkindly.

"Yeah. Maybe." He stared at his hands. The compass tattoo on his inner forearm -- the one he'd got in Bali, the one that was supposed to mean *I go where the wind takes me* but actually meant *I was drunk in Kuta and the tattoo parlor was open* -- stared back at him, permanently pointing nowhere in particular. "The thing is, right, I left uni after a year. Business degree at Monash. Hated it. Not because it was hard -- I don't know if it was hard, I never actually tried. I just hated what it represented. The conveyor belt. Go to school, go to uni, get a graduate job, buy a house, retire, die. I thought, sod this, I'm going to live. And I did. For four years I've lived more than anyone I know."

"Have you, though?"

The question landed softly but precisely, like a surgeon's scalpel touching the nerve. Connor looked at her.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, living more -- what does that look like? Not the Instagram version. The actual version. Are you learning things? Growing? Or are you just... in a different place, doing the same nothing?"

He should have been offended. A week ago he would have been. He would have hit her with the standard defence -- *at least I'm not a slave to the system, at least I'm experiencing the world, at least I'm not going to look back at forty and wish I'd taken the risk.* But something about the cave, or the incense, or the fact that he'd spent the morning photographing coffee he couldn't afford while calculating how many days he had until he was broke, had worn a hole in his armour, and Priya's question went right through it.

"I don't know," he said. And for once, he meant it.

They sat in the cave for a long time after that. The light shifted as the sun moved, the shafts turning from gold to amber to a deep honeyed orange that made the chamber look like the inside of a lantern. Priya told him about her degree -- the impossibility of fourth-year medicine, the patients she'd already lost on placement. She told him about her parents in Ealing -- her father the cardiologist at St Thomas' who was never home before nine, her mother who ran a GP practice in Wembley and had channelled her own medical ambition into Priya with a ferocity that was sometimes love and sometimes something harder.

"So you're running from something too," Connor said.

"I suppose. But I'm running toward something as well. The two aren't mutually exclusive."

He wanted to kiss her. The desire arrived fully formed, not as lust but as something closer to gratitude -- the need to close the gap between his loneliness and her attention. He leaned slightly. She was close enough that he could see the tiny scar on her upper lip. Her eyes, behind the round glasses, were dark and serious and very still.

He didn't kiss her. The moment held, balanced on its point like a coin on edge, and then a macaque screamed somewhere above them and a child laughed and the moment fell on its side and was just a moment, one of many, unremarkable except for the fact that Connor would remember it for the rest of his life, which would not be as long as either of them expected.

"We should head back," Priya said. "There's a thunderstorm coming."

She was right. By the time they descended the 272 rainbow steps, the sky had darkened to that particular equatorial purple that meant the clouds had been holding their breath all day and were about to exhale. The first drops fell as they reached the station, fat and warm. Then the sky opened and the world became water.

They stood under the station awning and watched the rain -- a wall of water descending vertically, turning the road into a river, the noise a sustained roar like standing inside a drum. The temperature dropped ten degrees in as many seconds, and the relief was physical, the city exhaling after a day of holding itself in.

"I like KL," Connor said, watching the rain.

"I know," Priya said. "That's what makes it dangerous for you."

He looked at her. She was looking at the rain.

---

Felix was on the rooftop when Connor got back to The Lantern that evening, sitting in one of the plastic chairs with a Tiger beer sweating in his hand, looking at the Petronas Towers as they did their nightly transformation from architectural achievement to jewellery. He looked, as always, like a man who never sweated, even in a city that was basically a sauna with traffic lights.

"Connor." He raised his beer. "Sit down."

Connor sat. Felix produced a second Tiger from somewhere -- he always had beer, the way other people always had anxiety -- and handed it over. Connor drank and felt the first sip spread through his chest like an argument he was losing.

"Good day?" Felix asked.

"Yeah. Went to Batu Caves with Priya."

"Ah, the caves. Beautiful place. I went when I first arrived in KL. Three years ago now." He sipped his beer. "You and Priya, you're spending a lot of time together."

"She's cool."

"She is cool. Smart, too. That's rare in hostels." Felix looked at him sideways, the scar on his eyebrow catching the last of the light. "She'll leave though. They always do, the smart ones. They have somewhere to go back to."

The sentence landed in the silence between them like a stone in still water. Connor felt the ripples but didn't acknowledge them. He drank his beer instead.

"How's the work going?" Felix asked. The question was casual. Everything Felix did was casual. It was his native register, the key in which he played every note.

"Yeah, good. Smashing it."

"The social media thing."

"Content strategy. Yeah."

"Pays well?"

Connor hesitated. The hesitation was microscopic -- a quarter-second pause before the breezy facade reassembled itself -- but Felix caught it. He'd been watching Connor for days, watching the way his eyes flickered to his phone screen and away, watching the quiet arithmetic of a man dividing dwindling resources against remaining time. Felix had seen this before. This was the shape of the trap -- not a trap he set, exactly, but a trap that already existed, a trap made of currency exchange rates and the cost of staying abroad. All Felix had to do was wait.

"It pays," Connor said. "Enough to keep me going."

"Going where?"

Connor laughed. "Here. There. Wherever." He drank. The beer was almost gone. The city spread out below them, a carpet of light, and above them the stars were appearing one by one through the gaps in the clouds, and the air smelled of rain and exhaust and the jasmine plant that someone had left in a pot by the rooftop railing.

"Can I be honest with you?" Felix said.

"Always, mate."

"The system is designed to make you go home." The speech was polished, rehearsed -- a script he'd delivered in hostels across Asia to broke, proud, afraid young travellers who looked exactly like Connor. "Rent. Bills. Visa restrictions. It's all engineered to force you back into the machine. But there are ways around it. If you know the right people."

He let the silence sit. A gecko chirped somewhere on the wall behind them, its small voice absurdly loud in the quiet.

"That offer's still open, mate," Felix said. "Nothing illegal. Just... logistics. Delivering documents, picking up packages. Import-export business. RM 200 per run, sometimes more."

The way he said it. That was the thing. The way he said *nothing illegal* with the relaxed authority of a man stating a fact. The way he said *RM 200* like it was a casual figure, not the difference between staying and going home, between freedom and defeat.

Connor thought about the maths. RM 200 a day. No more counting. No more photographing coffee he couldn't afford. RM 200 a day was staying. RM 200 a day was not going home.

"I'll think about it," Connor said.

"Of course." Felix leaned back. "No pressure. Ever. I just hate seeing good people go home because the system's rigged against them."

He finished his beer, stood, clapped Connor on the shoulder with the easy affection of a man who had just placed a bet and knew, with quiet certainty, that the house always wins.

"Goodnight, Connor. Think about it."

He disappeared down the staircase. Connor sat alone on the rooftop. The Petronas Towers watched him back.

---

The common room was nearly empty when Connor came downstairs. The red lanterns cast their permanent warm glow across the mismatched furniture and the bookshelf of abandoned novels.

Priya was in the corner, curled into an armchair, reading her Lonely Planet by the amber light of the nearest lantern. A pen in her hand, marking the margins. Planning. Always planning. She looked up when Connor entered and smiled, and he thought about the cave, the light through the gap in the rock, the conversation he couldn't quite believe had come out of his mouth.

He sat on the sofa across from her. Checked his phone. His Instagram post from that morning -- the flat white, the twelve hashtags, the lie about the digital nomad life -- had accumulated forty-one likes and two comments. One was from his mum: "Looks lovely darling! Stay safe xx." The other was from Pacific Soul's official account: a surfboard emoji, algorithmically deployed.

His phone buzzed.

A text from Felix: *No pressure. But if you're interested, I have something tomorrow. Easy. Quick. Think about it.*

Connor looked at the message. He looked at Priya, absorbed in her guidebook, lips moving slightly as she formed Malay words she was teaching herself. Because Priya learned the languages and read the signs and researched the laws. Because Priya did not assume that the world would rearrange itself around her convenience.

He thought about the afternoon. The vulnerability that had leaked out of him in the cave like blood from a wound he hadn't known he had. The way she'd looked at him when he said *I don't know* -- not with pity, not with judgment, but with something that felt like being seen for the first time in four years.

He thought about his bank balance. RM 847.23. Minus the two coffees today. Minus the train fare. Minus whatever tomorrow would cost. The number dropping like a countdown.

He texted Felix back: *Tell me more.*

He put his phone face-down on the armrest.

Priya looked up from her guidebook. "Everything okay?"

"Yeah," Connor said. He smiled -- the Instagram smile, confident, easy, bulletproof. The one he'd perfected over four years of pretending everything was fine.

"Everything's sweet."

Priya looked at him a moment longer. Then she nodded and returned to her book, and the pen resumed its quiet marking, and the red lanterns glowed, and somewhere outside a motorbike engine coughed to life and faded into the distance, and Connor sat in the warm amber light of The Lantern Hostel with his phone face-down and his future face-up and the word *logistics* turning over and over in his mind like a coin he couldn't stop flipping.

The smile didn't reach his eyes. But nobody was looking at his eyes. Nobody ever was.
