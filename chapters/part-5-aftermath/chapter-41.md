# Chapter 41: The Official Version

## I. The Report

The police report was filed at 9:47 AM on Saturday, February 14th, Malaysian time.

The report was composed in Bahasa Melayu, the language in which the machinery of the state conducted its business. The language was formal, bureaucratic -- the specific dialect of Malay that existed only in government documents and police reports, the dialect that stripped events of their humanity and reduced them to facts. The facts were arranged in a sequence, the sequence presented as a narrative, the narrative presented as truth.

Report Number: DW/KL/2026/0847-M
Station: Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters
Filing Officer: Inspector Kamal bin Yusof
Date of Incident: February 14, 2026
Time of Discovery: 00:02 AM
Location: Holding Cell C-7, Ground Floor, Detention Wing

**Subject:** Death of a Foreign National While in Custody

The subject, one CONNOR JAMES BRIGGS, male, Australian citizen, passport number PA7834521, date of birth 14 March 1998, was arrested at 11:45 hours on February 13, 2026, at a Royal Malaysian Police checkpoint on the North-South Expressway (E1), between KM 226 and KM 227, near the Tapah interchange, Perak. The subject was apprehended following a positive alert by PDRM narcotics detection canine unit K-9 Handler Corporal Zainal bin Hamid on a black hardshell suitcase registered to the subject and stored in the luggage compartment of Transnasional service 1087, bound for Penang.

The report continued. The report was four pages. The report described, in the language of the report, the sequence of events that led from the arrest of Connor Briggs to the discovery of his body in Cell C-7. The language was precise. The language was clinical. The language performed the function that language performed in all official documents -- the conversion of chaos into order, of suffering into syntax, of death into data.

What the report said:

The subject was transported to Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters and processed at 15:08 hours. The subject's personal effects were catalogued and secured. The subject was placed in Holding Cell C-7 pending formal charge proceedings scheduled for 09:00 hours on February 14. At 21:45 hours, a second detainee, one MOHD RIZAL BIN AHMAD, male, Malaysian citizen, IC number 890412-14-5567, arrested at 19:30 hours on a charge of assault (Section 323 of the Penal Code), was placed in Holding Cell C-7. At 00:02 hours on February 14, Guard Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor, conducting a routine check, discovered the subject hanging from the upper horizontal bar of the cell gate by means of a microfiber towel (colour: blue, brand: Sea to Summit) knotted around his neck. Emergency medical response was initiated. The subject was pronounced dead at 01:05 hours by attending medical officer Dr. Faizah binti Abdul Rahman. Cause of death: asphyxiation due to ligature compression of the neck, consistent with hanging. Manner of death: suicide.

What the report did not say:

The report did not say that the blue towel should not have been in the cell. Malaysian police holding cell protocol -- Standard Operating Procedure 14.2.3, Detention of Persons Pending Charge -- required the removal of all items that could be used as ligatures. Belts, shoelaces, drawstrings, scarves, towels. The protocol existed because people in custody died by hanging and the hanging was prevented by the removal of the means. The protocol was clear. The protocol was printed on a laminated card attached to the wall of the processing room. The protocol was taught in police training. The protocol had been in place since 2012, when a review of deaths in custody had identified ligature access as a preventable risk factor. The protocol said: remove the towel. The guard who processed Connor had not removed the towel. The guard who processed Connor was Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor, who was also the guard who discovered the body, who was also the guard who took a forty-minute bathroom break during his shift, who was also the guard whose bank account would show a deposit of RM5,000 from an untraceable source at 11:47 PM on February 13.

The report did not mention this deposit.

The report did not say that Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad's identity card number corresponded to a man who had been arrested and released from police custody four times in the past eighteen months, each time for minor offences, each time placed in a holding cell with another prisoner, and each time the other prisoner had been found dead within twelve hours. The four deaths had occurred in four different police stations across Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. All four were classified as suicides. All four involved ligatures that should not have been in the cells. All four occurred during guard shift changes or guard absences. The pattern was there. The pattern was in the system. The system had not seen it because the system was not designed to see its own patterns, the way a mirror was not designed to reflect itself.

The report did not mention Rizal's history.

The report did not say that Rizal had been released from custody at 04:30 AM on February 14, approximately two hours after the body was discovered, on the authority of Inspector Kamal bin Yusof -- the same inspector who filed the report. Rizal's release was processed as standard -- charges dropped, insufficient evidence, no further action. The release form was signed. The form was filed. Rizal walked out of Dang Wangi into the pre-dawn darkness and was collected by a silver Toyota Vios with no plates that had been waiting on Jalan Dang Wangi since midnight.

The report did not mention the silver Toyota Vios.

The report did not say that Felix Decker, German national, passport number C47FH1002, had boarded Malaysia Airlines flight MH752 from KLIA to Phnom Penh at 04:15 AM on February 14, approximately fifteen minutes before the body was officially discovered. The flight had been booked three days earlier, on February 11, the day Connor had picked up the black suitcase from Felix's room. Felix had paid for the ticket with a prepaid Visa card purchased at a 7-Eleven on Jalan Bukit Bintang. The card was registered to a name that was not Felix Decker. The name on the card was Martin Vogt, and Martin Vogt did not exist.

The report did not mention Felix Decker.

The report was four pages. The report was complete. The report was filed. The report was the official version -- the version that would be transmitted to the Australian High Commission, the version that would be cited in the death certificate, the version that would be referenced by the media, the version that would reach Connor's parents in Hawthorn and would be the first account they would read of how their son had died. The official version was the version that said: suicide. The official version was the version that said: the man was despondent. The official version was the version that said: the system functioned as designed.

The system had functioned as designed. The design was the problem.

## II. The Article

The article appeared in the Saturday edition of The Star, Malaysia's largest English-language daily newspaper.

The article was on page seven. Page seven was the page where news went to die -- not the front page, where the headlines lived, not the national news section on pages two through four, not the business section or the sports section or the entertainment section where readers' eyes naturally fell, but page seven, the interstitial page, the page between the news that mattered and the news that didn't, the page where a reader's attention was diffuse, scanning, unlikely to settle.

The article was six paragraphs. The article occupied approximately twelve square centimetres of newsprint, nestled between an advertisement for a condominium development in Shah Alam and a three-paragraph item about a water main break in Kepong. The article had no photograph. The article had a headline:

**FOREIGN NATIONAL DIES IN POLICE CUSTODY**

The article read:

*KUALA LUMPUR -- An Australian national was found dead in a holding cell at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters early yesterday morning, police confirmed.*

*Connor James Briggs, 27, of Melbourne, Australia, was discovered by a police constable during a routine check at approximately 2:17 AM on Friday. He was pronounced dead at the scene.*

*Briggs had been arrested on Thursday afternoon at a police checkpoint on the North-South Expressway in Perak on suspicion of drug trafficking. Police reportedly seized 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in a suitcase in the luggage compartment of an express bus bound for Penang.*

*Under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, possession of more than 50 grams of methamphetamine carries the mandatory death penalty upon conviction.*

*Police said the cause of death was suicide by hanging. The Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur has been notified.*

*An investigation into the death is being conducted in accordance with standard procedures for deaths in custody.*

Six paragraphs. One hundred and forty-seven words. The entirety of Connor Briggs's life and death, compressed into a space smaller than the advertisement for the condominium in Shah Alam. The condominium advertisement promised "luxury living from RM450,000" and featured a photograph of a swimming pool and a smiling family. The advertisement occupied three times the space of Connor's death. The advertisement would be seen by more people. The advertisement would be remembered longer. The property developer had paid for the space. Connor's death had not.

The article was accurate. Every fact was a fact. The name was spelled correctly. The age, the nationality, the charge, the legal reference -- all correct. The word "suicide" was in the article because the word was in the police report and the police report was the source and the source was the system and the system had said suicide.

The article was accurate and the article was a lie.

The lie was not in what the article said. The lie was in what the article was. The article was a container -- a vessel shaped to hold a specific volume of truth, and the volume was six paragraphs, and the six paragraphs were the space that the editor had allocated to the death of a foreign national in police custody, and the allocation was a judgment, and the judgment was: this story is worth twelve square centimetres. The judgment was: this death is page seven. The judgment was: this man is one hundred and forty-seven words.

The lie was in the judgment. The lie was in the decision that this death -- a death involving a towel that should not have been in a cell, a cellmate who had been in four other cells with four other dead prisoners, a guard who took a bribe, a trafficking network that operated out of a hostel in Chinatown, a German national who fled to Cambodia, a British-Indian medical student who had written a letter naming every person involved, a Japanese photojournalist who had fifty-nine photographs on a server in Tokyo, a hostel owner who was ready to confess, a cook whose niece was in prison for the same crime -- the lie was in the decision that all of this was worth one hundred and forty-seven words on page seven, between a condominium and a water main.

But the article existed. The article was printed. The article was delivered to 300,000 households across Malaysia and was available on The Star's website, where it would accumulate forty-three page views in its first week, thirty-one of them from Malaysia, four from Australia, three from the United Kingdom, two from Japan, one from Germany, one from Cambodia, and one from an IP address that could not be geolocated because it was routed through a VPN that bounced the signal through seven countries before arriving at the article, the digital equivalent of a person standing at the back of a room, watching, unidentifiable.

The article was not the story. The article was the shadow of the story. But shadows were evidence of objects, and the object that cast this shadow was large, and the shadow, though it appeared on page seven in twelve square centimetres, was the first public mark of a death that would not remain on page seven, that would migrate forward through the pages as the investigation progressed, that would eventually reach page one when the warrants were issued and the arrests were made and the word "suicide" was replaced by the word "murder" and the twelve square centimetres became twelve hundred and the one hundred and forty-seven words became fourteen thousand.

But that was later. That was weeks of police work and legal proceedings. On Saturday, February 15, the article was six paragraphs on page seven, and the six paragraphs were all that the public knew, and the public turned the page.

## III. The Commission

The Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur occupied the sixth floor of a modern tower on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng, four kilometres from Dang Wangi, eleven kilometres from the Lantern Hostel, twelve thousand kilometres from Hawthorn. The building was glass and steel, the architecture of diplomacy, the design language that said: we are here, we are permanent, we represent a nation.

Sarah Chen arrived at her desk at 8:00 AM on Saturday. She had been the one who made the call to Hawthorn. She had been the duty consular officer, which meant she was the person whose phone rang when an Australian died abroad after hours, the person who converted the information from the police report into the language of human communication, the person who said the words to the parents. She had said the words to David Briggs at 3 AM Melbourne time. She had held the silence after the words. She had heard the sound that Karen made. She had held that silence too.

She had made fourteen of these calls in her three years at the High Commission. Drownings in Langkawi. A motorcycle accident in Penang. A heart attack in the Cameron Highlands. A stabbing in Kuala Terengganu. Each call had its own geography of grief -- the arrangement of information and silence, the parental response that was, in its broad contours, always the same but in its details always unique, the way that waves were always waves but no two waves were identical.

Connor Briggs was not the first drug-related death. Two years ago, a woman from Perth, twenty-four, had been found dead in a Kota Bharu hotel room, an overdose of heroin that had been sold to her as something milder. The call to the parents in Perth had been different -- the father had been angry, the mother had been silent, the silence of a woman who had expected this call, who had been waiting for it, who had known that her daughter's trajectory was asymptotic to zero and that the asymptote would be reached in a room somewhere foreign.

Connor Briggs's parents had not expected this call. Their geography of grief was shock -- the impossibility of a reality that did not match the one they had been living in, the one sustained by monthly phone calls and Instagram posts and the $2,000 that arrived in his account and kept the fiction viable.

Sarah Chen opened her computer. The computer contained the templates -- the forms, letters, and notifications that constituted the bureaucratic architecture of repatriation. The architecture had been built over decades, one death at a time, each death adding a form or a contact that hadn't existed before. A monument built not of stone but of paperwork.

The paperwork for Connor Briggs: Consular Death Report. Request for Local Death Certificate. Authorisation for Repatriation of Remains -- the document that would move Connor's body from Hospital KL to a zinc-lined coffin in the cargo hold of a Qantas flight to Melbourne, classified as "human remains" and accompanied by a sanitary certificate and a customs declaration. Family Liaison Assignment.

Four documents. Four templates. Each one representing a gap in the system that a previous death had revealed and filled. Sarah Chen opened the first template. Connor Briggs would be Row 1,247 in the Department's spreadsheet of Australian deaths abroad.

She would meet the parents. She would accompany them to the morgue. She would answer their questions with the answers in the police report, the answers that said suicide.

She would not tell them that she didn't believe the report. In three years at the High Commission, she had processed three deaths in custody. All three classified as suicide. All three exhibiting the same pattern -- a ligature that should not have been present, a guard's absence, a cellmate released shortly after the death. She would not tell them because telling them was not her function. Her function was consular assistance. Her function was paperwork. The process did not include the expression of personal doubts about the official report that the process was built upon.

She began to type.

Name of deceased: BRIGGS, Connor James.
Date of birth: 14/03/1998.
Date of death: 14/02/2026.
Place of death: Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Cause of death: Suicide by hanging (per Malaysian Police Report DW/KL/2026/0847-M).
Next of kin: David Arthur Briggs (father), Karen Louise Briggs (mother).
Address of next of kin: 47 Auburn Road, Hawthorn, Victoria 3122, Australia.

She typed the information and the typing was mechanical, the fingers moving on the keys the way they had moved for fourteen deaths before this one, the rhythm of the data entry unaltered by the content of the data, the fingers not knowing or caring that the name they typed belonged to a person who had been alive fifty-six hours ago, a person who had surfed and laughed and eaten nasi lemak and called his mother not enough and carried packages through the streets of a city that he had never understood and died in a cell with a towel around his neck and a word on his lips that the report did not record because the report did not record last words, the report recording only the facts, and the facts were the facts that the system produced, and the system had produced suicide.

She saved the document. She opened the next template.

The bureaucracy of death continued. The bureaucracy was patient. The bureaucracy had all the time in the world.

## IV. The Hostel

At the Lantern Hostel, on Petaling Street, in Chinatown, in Kuala Lumpur, the morning of Saturday, February 15th began the way every morning began.

The call to prayer from Masjid Jamek at 5:32 AM, the sound travelling across the rooftops and through the air well and into the rooms where the building's guests slept or did not sleep, the sound that was both alarm clock and invocation, both practical and spiritual, both of the world and above it. The sound that Connor had heard every morning for forty-six mornings and had never once identified as a call to prayer, had never once asked what it was, had absorbed it as ambient noise the way he absorbed everything about the city -- as backdrop, as atmosphere, as content.

The sound entered the building and the building received it. The building had been receiving this sound since 1928. The building would continue receiving it after everyone currently in it was gone.

Mei Ling opened the reception desk at 7:00 AM. She turned on the computer. She checked the booking system. Three new arrivals today: a German couple from Munich (Dorm 1, Beds 3 and 4) and a solo French student (Dorm 3, Bed 7). The French student had booked last night, online, from a hostel in Singapore where she was completing a three-day stay before continuing north through Malaysia.

Mei Ling looked at the booking. Dorm 3, Bed 7. The bed that had been stripped and remade twelve hours ago. The bed where Connor had slept for forty-six nights. The bed where Lena had slept before him. The bed where Nurul had slept before Lena. The bed that was, in the booking system, simply a bed -- a horizontal surface, a mattress, a set of coordinates in a database, available, bookable, occupiable.

She processed the booking. She assigned the bed. The system did not flag the bed. The system did not note that its previous three occupants had been arrested for drug trafficking, that one was dead, one was in prison, one was awaiting trial. The system did not note these things because the system was a booking system and booking systems tracked occupancy, not outcomes. The system knew that Bed 7 was vacant. The system did not know why.

Mama Siti arrived in the kitchen at 6:30 AM. She arrived the way she always arrived -- through the back entrance, the narrow door that opened onto the alley behind the building, the door that she had been using for thirty years, the door whose key she kept on a string around her neck, the string and the key both so old that they had become part of her body, an extension of her anatomy, the way a surgeon's scalpel became an extension of the hand.

She began cooking. Nasi lemak. The rice soaked since 4:00 AM -- she had come in early, as she did every day, to set the rice in the coconut milk, the rice and the milk beginning their slow fusion in the dark kitchen while the city slept. Now she lit the stove. The blue flame caught. The pot went on. The sambal was already made -- ground the night before, the chillies and the shallots and the belacan pounded in the stone mortar that had been in the kitchen since before the kitchen was a kitchen, since the building was a gambling den, possibly since the building was something worse. The sambal was red. The sambal was always red.

She cooked the ikan bilis. The tiny dried anchovies fried in oil until they were golden and crisp, the smell rising through the kitchen and into the air well and up through the building, the smell that was the hostel's morning signature, the olfactory equivalent of the call to prayer -- the announcement that the day had begun, that food was available, that the building was offering sustenance to its occupants.

At 7:15 AM, when the rice was cooked and the sambal was warm and the ikan bilis were drained and the cucumber was sliced and the egg was fried, Mama Siti prepared a plate. She prepared it with the same care she prepared every plate -- the rice moulded on the banana leaf, the sambal in its red comma beside the rice, the ikan bilis scattered like punctuation, the cucumber in its crescent, the egg with its lace edges.

She placed the plate on the counter. She placed it at the end of the counter, the position where Connor had stood every morning, the position that was between the coffee station and the bread toaster, the position that Connor had occupied because it was closest to the charging outlet where he plugged in his phone while he ate. The position was not marked. The position was not labelled. The position was simply the place where Connor stood, and the plate was placed there because the plate was for Connor, and Connor was dead, and the plate was for Connor anyway.

No one claimed the plate.

At 8:00 AM, the German couple from Dorm 1 came down and took plates from the stack and served themselves from the communal tray of nasi lemak that Mama Siti had prepared for the guests. They did not take the plate on the counter. The plate on the counter was not part of the communal offering. The plate on the counter was separate, individual, prepared for a specific person. The couple did not know this. The couple did not know that a specific person had existed or that the specific person was absent or that the absence was permanent. The couple ate their breakfast and discussed whether to visit the Batu Caves or the Petronas Towers. They chose the towers.

At 9:00 AM, a backpacker from Dorm 2 -- a Canadian, twenty-one, on his first trip abroad -- came down and saw the plate and reached for it.

"That one is taken," Mei Ling said from the reception desk. She said it without looking up. She said it in the flat, informational tone of a receptionist communicating a policy. The Canadian withdrew his hand and served himself from the communal tray.

The plate sat on the counter. The rice cooled. The sambal developed a thin film. The ikan bilis softened in the humidity. The egg's yolk set to solid. The plate was a plate of food that had been prepared for a person who would not eat it, and the preparation was not rational and was not intended to be rational. The preparation was ritual. The preparation was Mama Siti's grammar of grief -- the language she spoke when Bahasa Melayu and English were insufficient, the language of cooking for the dead, the language that said: *you were here, you ate what I made, the making was my caring, and the caring does not stop because you have stopped*.

At noon, Mama Siti cleared the plate. She scraped the food into the bin. She washed the plate. She dried it. She placed it back in the stack.

The next morning, Sunday, she prepared the plate again. Same position on the counter. Same arrangement. Same care. No one claimed it. At noon, she cleared it.

Monday: the plate. The counter. Noon. Cleared.

Tuesday: the plate. The counter. Noon. Cleared.

This continued for seven days. Seven plates of nasi lemak, prepared and unclaimed and cleared. Seven mornings of rice moulded on banana leaf and sambal in its red comma and ikan bilis scattered and cucumber in its crescent and egg with its lace edges. Seven noons of scraping and washing and drying and stacking.

On the eighth day, a Sunday, Mama Siti prepared the plate. She placed it on the counter. She stood beside it. She looked at it the way she had looked at Connor on the rooftop -- the direct, unfiltered look of a woman who had abandoned indirection.

She spoke. She spoke in Malay, quietly, to the plate, to the counter, to the position where Connor had stood, to the air that had once contained him and now did not.

"*Pergi dengan selamat*," she said. *Go safely.*

She picked up the plate. She carried it to the air well -- the open courtyard at the centre of the building, the space where the sky was visible above and the mosaic tile bench sat below and the laundry lines crossed like the strings of an instrument. She placed the plate on the mosaic bench. She left it there.

The plate sat in the air well for the rest of the day. The afternoon rain came at 3 PM -- the daily equatorial thunderstorm, the deluge that dropped from the visible sky through the open air well and hammered the tiles and the bench and the plate, the rain dissolving the rice and washing the sambal into a red streak across the mosaic and scattering the ikan bilis and lifting the egg and carrying everything into the drain at the corner of the courtyard, the drain that led to the pipes that led to the river that led to the Strait of Malacca that led to the sea.

The plate was empty after the rain. The plate was clean. The rain had done what Mama Siti's hands had done for seven days but with the finality that hands could not provide, the finality of the natural world performing the function that ritual had been performing, the function of clearing, of completing, of ending.

Mama Siti collected the plate. She brought it inside. She washed it, though the rain had already washed it. She dried it. She placed it in the stack.

She did not prepare the plate on the ninth day.

The position at the counter remained empty. The charging outlet was used by other phones. The mornings continued. The nasi lemak was served from the communal tray. The building performed normalcy.

But the staff knew. Mei Ling knew, and her knowing was in the way she looked at Dorm 3's door each time she walked past it, the look that lasted a fraction of a second longer than a look at any other door, the fraction that was the distance between routine and memory. Uncle Razak knew, and his knowing was in the new red pin on his map -- the pin that was placed on the map of Kuala Lumpur, not on the map of world hostels but on a separate map, a new map, a map of just this city, just this building, a map that had only one pin, the pin that said: *here, this one, this was ours*.

Aziz knew. Aziz, who had fixed the fan in Connor's dorm and opened his mouth to speak and closed it and left. Aziz, who had been a police officer and had lost his career to the act of speaking. Aziz stood in the alley behind the building and smoked and the smoking was the same as it always was but the standing was different, the standing was heavier, the standing of a man who had added another silence to the collection of silences that he carried, the collection that had begun with the silence that cost him his badge and had grown, silence by silence, into the weight that pressed him against the wall of the alley, the weight that was invisible and permanent and the precise weight of the words he had not said to Connor Briggs on Day 6 when he stood in the doorway of Dorm 3 and opened his mouth and closed it.

The French student arrived at 6 PM. She checked in. She climbed the narrow staircase. She entered Dorm 3. She found Bed 7. She put her backpack on the bed. She looked around the room -- the ceiling fan, the air well window, the bunks, the lockers, the peeling paint, the red lantern glow from the corridor. She smiled. The room was perfect. The room was exactly what she had hoped for -- authentic, atmospheric, the real Southeast Asian hostel experience, the kind of place that had stories.

She climbed into bed. She pulled the sheet over herself. Her hand rested on the wooden rail.

She did not feel the letters carved into the wood. She did not read them. She did not know that beneath her fingertips was the name of a Swedish woman who had slept in this bed and carried packages for a charming man and been arrested and imprisoned and whose name was the bed's only memory, the only mark left by the procession of bodies that had occupied this specific horizontal surface.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

Outside, the city hummed. The neon signs of Petaling Street cast their colours on the wet pavement. The smell of char kway teow rose from the hawker stalls. The call to prayer from Masjid Jamek would come at 5:32 AM. The nasi lemak would be ready by 7:15 AM. The communal tray would be full. The counter position would be empty.

The hostel was open. The hostel was operational. The hostel was accepting guests.

Check-in was at 2 PM. Check-out was at 11 AM. The rules were posted in four languages. The wifi password was on the whiteboard behind reception. The house rules were clear, and the last rule, the one written in red at the bottom of the laminated card, the one that Connor had never read, the one that was the building's only explicit warning, was still there:

*Guests are responsible for knowing and obeying Malaysian law. The hostel is not liable.*

The building breathed. The lanterns glowed. The air well was dark and wet from the afternoon rain. The mosaic bench held no plate. The drain at the corner held the faintest trace of sambal, a red residue that the rain had not fully washed away, a mark that would be gone by morning but was, for now, still visible -- the colour of chillies and the colour of blood and the colour of lanterns, the red that was the building's signature, the red that meant warmth and welcome and warning, the red that said: *come in, the door is open, the bed is ready, the price is listed, the law is posted, the rest is up to you*.

*End of Chapter 41*
