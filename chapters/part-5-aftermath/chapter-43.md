# Chapter 43: The Investigation

## I. The Letter

The letter arrived at Dang Wangi at 7:47 PM on Saturday, February 15th -- seventeen hours after Connor Briggs was pronounced dead in Holding Cell C-7 on the ground floor of the same building in which Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail now sat, at his desk, on the second floor, in the narcotics division, reading the email that had travelled from a kitchen table in Bermondsey to his inbox in the time it took for a signal to cross eleven time zones, which was approximately one point four seconds, which was less time than it took for a man to lose consciousness under ligature compression, which was the fact that Ahmad's mind produced without his permission, the fact arriving the way facts arrived in the minds of police officers who had spent twenty years learning the technical specifications of death.

The email was from a woman named Priya Sharma. The email was twelve pages. The email was single-spaced. The email was, in its precision and its controlled fury, the most comprehensive witness statement Ahmad had received in his twenty years with the Royal Malaysia Police -- and the statement had not been written by a police officer or a prosecutor or a forensic investigator but by a fourth-year medical student at King's College London who was sitting in a cold flat six thousand miles away and who had assembled, from memory and observation and the careful accumulation of forty-seven days of paying attention, a document that mapped the entire architecture of a trafficking network operating out of a phone repair shop on Petaling Street.

Ahmad read the letter twice.

He read it once quickly, the way a man reads when the content is urgent and the time is limited -- the eyes scanning, the mind filtering for names and dates and locations, the executive summary that the brain performed automatically when confronted with a document that contained more information than could be processed in a single pass. The first reading yielded: Felix Decker. Wei. Rizal. Guard Hafiz. Inspector Kamal. The Lantern Hostel. The phone repair shop. The suitcase. The towel. The death that was not a suicide.

He read it a second time slowly. The second reading was the reading that mattered -- the reading in which the details emerged from between the facts, the reading in which the connections became visible, the reading in which the letter transformed from a statement into a map and the map showed him not just what had happened but how the system worked, the system that had recruited Connor Briggs and used him and killed him and filed a report that said suicide, the system that Ahmad had suspected existed but had lacked the external evidence to prove.

He had given Connor Briggs his card.

The memory surfaced from the spreadsheet he kept on the personal laptop at home -- the ThinkPad in the drawer beside his bed, password-protected, the laptop where he tracked the investigation that did not officially exist. In the notes column beside what would become Connor's row, he had written weeks earlier: *Checkpoint stop, Jalan Alor area, approx. January 20. Australian male, cooperative. Passport PA7734819. Advised caution. Gave card.* The card was one of four hundred and twelve that Ahmad had given out in six years -- his own cards, printed at his own expense at a shop in Brickfields, each bearing his name, his rank, his number, and a line in English and Bahasa Melayu that no official protocol required but that Ahmad had added because the system did not protect people and someone had to try:

*If you are in trouble with Malaysian law, call this number before you speak to anyone else.*

Connor had kept the card. Connor had placed it in his wallet beside his Australian driver's licence. And Priya's letter told Ahmad what happened next: Connor had dialled the number. In the final days, when the truth about what he was carrying had become undeniable, Connor had held the phone to his ear and heard the line connect and had hung up after three seconds -- three seconds in which Ahmad's phone had registered an incoming call from an unknown number and Ahmad had looked at the screen and let it ring because unknown numbers at midnight were usually nothing, wrong numbers or telemarketers or the noise of a telecommunications system producing its thousands of daily errant connections.

Three seconds. The width of the gap between a man asking for help and a man deciding not to. Three seconds that Ahmad would carry the way Priya carried the jade bracelet, the way Karen carried the silence at 3 AM -- the personal artefact of a near-miss that was worse than no contact because no contact was the absence of possibility and the three-second call was the presence of possibility that existed and expired.

Ahmad put the card back in the drawer. He closed the drawer.

He began to work.

## II. The Towel

The investigation began with Standard Operating Procedure 14.2.3.

Detention of Persons Pending Charge. Seventeen pages. Step 14 of the processing protocol: *All items presenting a risk of self-harm shall be removed from the detained person prior to placement in a holding cell. Items include but are not limited to: belts, shoelaces, drawstrings, scarves, lanyards, ropes, cables, towels, bedsheets, and any item of clothing or equipment that could be fashioned into a ligature.*

Towels. The word was in the protocol. The word was printed on the laminated card attached to the wall of the processing room, the card that every officer passed every time they processed a detainee, the card that was positioned at eye level, the card that was impossible to miss unless missing it was the intention.

Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor had processed Connor Briggs at 17:08 hours on February 13th. Hafiz had catalogued the belongings -- wallet, phone, sandals, bracelet -- and placed them in a plastic bag. The blue Sea to Summit microfiber travel towel was not in the bag. The processing log contained a marginal note in Hafiz's handwriting: *Towel left with detainee for comfort.* Two words in a margin. Either an act of kindness or an act of preparation. The determination of which would be the first thread that Ahmad pulled.

Ahmad pulled it on a Tuesday evening, six days after the letter arrived.

The pulling was not dramatic. The pulling was digital -- a number on a screen in a banking database, the result of a court order that Ahmad had obtained from a magistrate at the Kuala Lumpur Magistrate's Court, the order compelling Bank Negara Malaysia to provide transaction records for Savings Account 7142-8899-3301 at Maybank, Jalan Tun Perak branch, the account registered to Hafiz bin Mohd Noor.

At 10:47 PM on February 13, 2026 -- approximately an hour before Connor Briggs was found dead -- a deposit of RM5,000 had been made to the account. The deposit was via cash transfer at an ATM on Jalan Bukit Bintang, a machine that accepted deposits without a card, without identification, without the human intermediary of a teller window. Anonymous. Untraceable in the traditional sense.

But the deposit was there. RM5,000 in an account that had not received a deposit larger than RM2,800 -- Hafiz's monthly salary -- in the previous twelve months. The deposit was made on the night that Hafiz had left a towel in a cell where a towel should not have been, on the night that Hafiz had taken a forty-minute bathroom break during which the cell was unmonitored, on the night that Hafiz had returned to find a body and had filed a statement saying he discovered it during a routine check.

Ahmad printed the transaction record. He opened the CCTV footage from the custody corridor -- footage he had subpoenaed on Sunday, the day after the letter arrived, from the station's own surveillance system, the subpoena necessary because the footage was under Inspector Kamal's administrative control and Kamal had not included it in the original report. The subpoena bypassed Kamal. The subpoena was the legal instrument that allowed Ahmad to access evidence in his own building without the permission of the man who had reason to ensure the evidence was never seen.

The footage showed: at 23:15, Hafiz standing from his desk, removing his earbuds, walking toward the toilet at the end of the corridor. He did not return until 23:55. Forty minutes. The custody corridor was empty for forty minutes. Whatever happened in Cell C-7 happened without a witness whose testimony the investigation could compel.

The footage showed something else. At 04:27 AM -- approximately two hours after the body was discovered -- a man walked out of the custody wing through the rear door to the station car park. Medium build. Grey institutional tracksuit. The unhurried gait of a person who was not fleeing but departing, not escaping but being released. Ahmad tracked the man through the external cameras: across the car park, through the rear gate -- the gate that was supposed to be locked after midnight, the gate whose keypad code was known only to custody wing officers -- and left onto Jalan Dang Wangi, where a silver Toyota Vios waited on the opposite kerb, engine running, headlights off, registration plates removed. The man opened the rear door. Climbed in. The car pulled away eastbound.

Timestamp: 04:32 AM. Vehicle description submitted to PDRM traffic division. The Vios would not appear on any camera after Jalan Dang Wangi. The Vios would vanish the way the man inside it would vanish -- professionally, completely.

But Ahmad had the footage. Ahmad had the timestamp. Ahmad had the open gate. And from Priya's letter and the station's own records, Ahmad had the name of the officer who had authorised the man's release at 04:30 AM: Inspector Kamal bin Yusof. The same inspector who filed the death report. The same inspector who classified Connor Briggs's death as suicide.

Ahmad placed the transaction record and the CCTV analysis in the folder on his desk. The folder was growing.

He was building a case against a superior officer in his own station. The case was being constructed in the same building where the crime had been committed, the evidence gathered from the same systems that the suspects had access to. The geometry was the geometry of a man defusing a device that he was standing on.

## III. The Pattern

The IC number was the key.

Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad. Identity Card 890412-14-5567. Ahmad entered the number into the PDRM criminal records database on a Monday morning, nine days after Connor's death, his office door closed, his screen angled away from the corridor window. The database returned a thin record -- deliberately thin, the kind maintained at minimum detail because maximum detail would have revealed what Ahmad was looking for.

Ahmad was not looking in the local records. Ahmad was looking across jurisdictions.

The PDRM's databases were siloed by district, each station's records existing in isolation, the information architecture designed for local case management rather than pattern detection across multiple stations. The pattern was there. The pattern had been there for years. The pattern had been invisible because the system was not designed to see its own patterns, the way a mirror was not designed to reflect itself.

Ahmad cross-referenced. He pulled detention records from four districts. The cross-referencing took three days -- three days of formal requests and inter-station protocols and the bureaucratic friction that the system generated when one station asked another station for records, the friction that was normally an inconvenience but that in this case was the barrier that had prevented the pattern from being detected, the administrative architecture that had allowed a man to move from cell to cell across the Klang Valley leaving bodies behind him without any single station connecting its death to the deaths in the other stations.

The cross-reference produced:

IC 890412-14-5567 -- the number registered to Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad -- appeared in the detention records of four other police stations. Each appearance followed the same structure: arrested on a minor charge, placed in a holding cell with a prisoner facing drug trafficking charges, the prisoner found dead within twelve hours, death classified as suicide, Rizal released the following morning.

Serdang. July 2023. Cellmate: Daniel Park, 24, Korean-American. 200g methamphetamine. Found dead at 03:40 AM. Ligature: belt. Should have been removed per SOP 14.2.3. Rizal released 05:15 AM.

Shah Alam. January 2024. Cellmate: Mikhail Sorokin, 29, Russian. 180g methamphetamine. Found dead at 02:55 AM. Ligature: drawstring from tracksuit trousers. Should have been removed. Rizal released 04:00 AM.

Petaling Jaya. June 2024. Cellmate: Abdul Rahim bin Yusof, 31, Malaysian. 75g methamphetamine. Found dead at 01:20 AM. Ligature: shoelaces. Should have been removed. Rizal released 03:45 AM.

Sentul. October 2025. Cellmate: Suresh Pillai, 35, Malaysian-Indian. 120g methamphetamine. Found dead at 04:10 AM. Ligature: towel. Rizal released 05:30 AM.

Dang Wangi. February 2026. Cellmate: Connor James Briggs, 27, Australian. 450g methamphetamine. Found dead at 02:17 AM. Ligature: microfiber travel towel. Rizal released 04:30 AM.

Five cells. Five cellmates. Five dead. Five suicides. Five ligatures that should have been removed. Five releases in the hours following the death.

Ahmad looked at the list. The list was not a list. The list was a production schedule. The list was the operational record of a man whose function in the network was the elimination of arrested mules, a function performed with the regularity of a maintenance task, the network activating the protocol when a mule was caught the way a company activated its insurance policy when an asset was compromised -- automatically, procedurally, without sentiment.

Five dead. Five human beings who had been converted to five rows in Ahmad's spreadsheet, five cases in the PDRM system, five entries that SUARAM had documented without connecting them, five families in five countries who had received phone calls in the night and been told the word *suicide*. The word had been accepted by the system because the system had accepted it, each station examining its own death in isolation, each death an anomaly within its own district, the anomalies never aggregated, the pattern never assembled, the five data points never plotted on the same graph.

Until now. Until a letter from London and a spreadsheet on a ThinkPad in Wangsa Maju and a narcotics sergeant who could not stop following patterns.

Ahmad called the Deputy Public Prosecutor's office. The call initiated the process by which evidence became authority -- the process of warrants and charges that would give a sergeant the power to arrest the people in his folder, regardless of their rank or their proximity to his own desk.

## IV. The Arrests

The warrants were executed on a Thursday morning.

February 27th. 06:00 AM. Thirteen days after Connor Briggs's death. Three warrants. Three simultaneous operations -- the simultaneity coordinated so that no arrest would alert the others, the timing the tactical requirement of an investigation that could not afford to lose a suspect to flight. Ahmad had requested operational support from the Federal Narcotics Division at Bukit Aman -- not Dang Wangi officers, not officers who owed their positions to Inspector Kamal or their loyalty to the institutional hierarchy that Kamal occupied. The request was the tactical decision that removed the operation from the jurisdiction of the compromised station and placed it in the hands of the institution that the station answered to.

The first arrest was at WEI'S MOBILE: REPAIRS & ACCESSORIES, Petaling Street.

The shutters were down. The shop had been closed since February 14th -- since the morning when Wei had arrived for work and found Petaling Street full of police cars and the hostel cordoned off and had understood, with the immediate calculation of a man who knew what the police cars meant, that the protocol had been activated and the aftermath was two doors away. Wei had not run. Running was the amateur's response. Wei had closed the shop and maintained his routine and waited, the stillness of a man who understood that disappearance attracted attention and that the system processed the visible and overlooked the still.

The Bukit Aman team breached the shutters at 06:02 AM. The sound was the investigation's first public act -- metal giving way, the screech of the roller mechanism, the percussion of entry on Petaling Street. The char kway teow vendor across the road was lighting his wok, the blue flame catching. He watched the way vendors watched everything on Petaling Street -- with the studied indifference of a man who had been selling noodles in the same spot for twenty years and who had learned that the business of the street and the business of the police were parallel tracks that never touched.

Wei was in the back room. The back room contained what Ahmad's surveillance had anticipated and what Priya's letter had described: a vacuum sealer, commercial grade; a digital scale accurate to 0.1 grams; rolls of cling film; empty phone charger boxes with their interior padding removed; and on the stainless steel table, three vacuum-sealed bags containing a white crystalline substance that would field-test positive for methamphetamine. Packaging materials. The infrastructure of a logistics operation.

Wei was arrested. Wei said nothing. Wei's silence was the silence of a professional calculating the cost of every word, the silence that would hold for approximately fourteen hours before the evidence from the back room and the bank records and the CCTV footage from Wei's own security camera -- the camera that had recorded every pickup and drop-off, every face that entered the room, including Felix Decker's -- before all of this was presented to Wei and his lawyer and the silence became more dangerous than speech and the calculation shifted from concealment to cooperation. That calculation, and its consequences, would unfold in the weeks to come, in the interview rooms at Sungai Buloh, where Wei would describe the supply chain and the protocol and the names of eight mules recruited from the Lantern Hostel.

But that was later. On the morning of February 27th, Wei was cuffed and placed in a car, and the shop was sealed with yellow crime-scene tape -- bright against the old shophouse facade, the present's assertion over the past's architecture, the visual declaration that this building was no longer a phone repair shop but a point on the map that Ahmad was drawing.

The second arrest was in Kepong.

Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor lived in a flat on the seventh floor of a housing development twelve kilometres north of the city centre -- the standard configuration of a government-subsidised unit, the kind of flat that a police constable on RM2,800 per month could afford. The banking records told the rest of the story: not just the RM5,000 deposit on February 13th, but a pattern -- RM4,000 on October 10, 2025, the date that Suresh Pillai was found dead in his cell at Sentul. The dates of deposits corresponded to the dates of deaths. The correlation was the evidence. The evidence was in the folder. The folder was in Ahmad's hand when the team knocked on Hafiz's door at 06:08 AM.

Hafiz answered in a sarong and a T-shirt. His two-year-old daughter was on his hip. Behind him, his wife was preparing the morning's rice, the domestic smell that would become, in Hafiz's memory, the smell of the last normal moment.

"Constable Hafiz bin Mohd Noor, you are under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code, and for abuse of power under Section 23 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009."

Hafiz did not speak. His face performed the operation that Ahmad had seen on the faces of arrested officers -- the rapid recalculation of identity, the collapse of the self-image that said *I am the law* and the emergence of the new image that said *I am subject to the law*, the transformation that occurred in the eyes, the eyes of a constable becoming the eyes of a suspect in the duration of a sentence.

The wife appeared in the hallway. She held a cooking spoon. The spoon dripped water onto the floor. Her face was the face of a woman who understood -- not the details, not the deposits and the bathroom breaks and the towels, but the shape. She had known the shape of what was happening because she had known that the money was wrong, that the amounts were wrong, that the explanations were wrong, and she had not asked because not-asking was the condition of the arrangement, the silence that was the premium paid for the surplus.

Hafiz handed the daughter to his wife. He held out his wrists.

In approximately four hours, in an interview room at Bukit Aman -- not Dang Wangi, the investigation had moved beyond Dang Wangi -- Hafiz would break his silence. He would describe the phone call that offered the money. The voice on the phone had mentioned his daughter's name -- Aisyah, seven months old -- and the mention was not a threat but was understood as a threat, the way a gun displayed on a table was not a threat but was understood as a threat. Fear, not greed. The distinction mattered legally. The distinction did not matter to Connor Briggs.

The third action was not an arrest. It was a suspension.

Inspector Kamal bin Yusof was summoned to the Deputy Commissioner's office at Bukit Aman at 09:00 AM, three hours after the arrests. A staff officer delivered a sealed envelope to Kamal's office on the third floor of Dang Wangi -- one floor above Ahmad's -- containing his immediate suspension from duty pending investigation into his conduct in the matter of Report Number DW/KL/2026/0847-M.

Kamal read the letter. Kamal placed it on his desk. Kamal removed his badge and his service weapon and the authority that the badge and the weapon represented and placed them on the desk beside the letter. Kamal stood and walked out of his office and down the corridor and past Ahmad's office -- Ahmad was there, the door open -- and the two men's eyes met. The meeting of the eyes was the meeting of two men who had worked in the same building for four years and whose relationship had just been redefined from colleagues to investigator and suspect, the redefinition occurring in the space of a glance that held everything the investigation contained.

Kamal walked out of Dang Wangi. Kamal was not arrested because the evidence against him was still being assembled -- Hafiz's testimony, the banking records, the cell assignment authorisations, the release documentation for Rizal. Kamal was free. Kamal was the kind of free that was not free -- the freedom of a man whose phone was now monitored, whose bank accounts were now frozen, whose movements were tracked by the same system he had once commanded.

The international warrants were filed the same day. Felix Decker: INTERPOL Red Notice, transmitted through the Malaysian National Central Bureau to 195 member countries. Last known location Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Immigration records confirmed Felix had cleared departure at KLIA at 03:47 AM on February 14th -- twenty minutes before his flight, ninety minutes before the body was officially discovered, the timing not coincidence but choreography, the scheduling of the murder and the scheduling of the flight coordinated with the precision that was Felix's signature, the logistics of disappearance planned alongside the logistics of death.

Rizal's warrant was issued to a fiction. Mohd Rizal bin Ahmad, IC 890412-14-5567, was a constructed identity -- a name attached to a body, the identity a tool used and discardable. The warrant was for the body. The body was somewhere in Southeast Asia, absorbed into the infrastructure that had deployed it, the network consuming its own operative the way it consumed its mules, the difference being that mules were consumed as liabilities and operatives were consumed as assets to be preserved, relocated, redeployed.

Ahmad issued the warrants knowing they would not immediately produce their targets. He issued them because the warrants were the system's declaration that these men were no longer free, the documents that converted the state's attention from passive to active, from surveillance to pursuit.

## V. The Photographs

On the morning of the arrests, Tomoko Sato sent her photographs to two recipients: Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail at Dang Wangi, and Lim Wei Ling at The Star.

Fifty-nine photographs, backed up to a cloud server in Tokyo before Felix's associates stole her camera. Felix and Connor on the rooftop. Connor carrying packages on Petaling Street. Felix at Wei's shop window. Connor at the Jalan Ipoh drop. The chronological record of a recruitment, captured by a woman who had recognised the predator's pattern from Day 3 and had documented it with the professional discipline of a photojournalist and the professional detachment that she would later identify as her greatest failure.

For Ahmad, the photographs were corroboration. For The Star, they were a story.

---

## VI. The Front Page

The Star published the photographs on Tuesday, March 3rd. Page one. Above the fold.

**MURDER IN CUSTODY: PHOTOGRAPHS REVEAL DRUG NETWORK THAT KILLED AUSTRALIAN BACKPACKER**

Four thousand words spanning pages one, four, and five. The photographs reproduced across page four. The names that had been in Ahmad's folder now in the information stream that three hundred thousand households received. The article named Felix Decker, the Lantern Hostel, Wei's phone repair shop. It described the network's method. It cited SUARAM. It quoted the Australian High Commission. It did not name Priya. It could not quote Ahmad.

The original one hundred and forty-seven words had become fourteen thousand. The word *suicide* was being replaced by the word *murder*, and the replacement was migrating through the system, slow but irreversible.

---

## VII. The Desk

Ahmad sat at his desk at Dang Wangi on the evening of March 3rd. The article would not compromise the case -- the photographs were evidence independently submitted to both the police and the newspaper. Ahmad had not leaked. Ahmad had not briefed. Ahmad had done what Ahmad always did: built the case, executed the warrants, filed the charges, and let the evidence speak through the channels that the evidence found.

He opened the laptop. The spreadsheet. Six rows. Six names. Six deaths.

BRIGGS, Connor James.

The file was open. The arrests were made. The warrants were issued. The front page had been printed. The machinery of accountability was turning, and the turning, however slow, was the thing that distinguished this death from the five that preceded it.

Ahmad closed the laptop. He walked down the corridor, past the night crew, past the door to the custody wing where Cell C-7's fluorescent light was on. The light was always on. He walked out of Dang Wangi into the warm KL night.

And somewhere, in a city that Ahmad could not reach, in a hostel that Ahmad did not know the name of, a man with a German accent and a thin scar on his left eyebrow was sitting in a common room, drinking a beer, smiling at a stranger who was broke and lonely and far from home. The stranger was young. The stranger was exactly the kind of person the man looked for.

The pattern continued. The investigation continued. The two ran in parallel, locked together in the oldest geometry of all.

*End of Chapter 43*
