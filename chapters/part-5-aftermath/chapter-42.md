# Chapter 42: Priya's War

The flat in Bermondsey was cold.

Not the cold of Kuala Lumpur's air conditioning, which was the cold of machines -- the aggressive, artificial chill that Malaysian buildings deployed against the equatorial heat, the cold that hit like a wall when you walked through a door and announced that you had crossed from outside to inside, from the natural world to the institutional one. This was a different cold. This was London cold. February cold. The cold of a city that existed at fifty-one degrees north and had been grey since October and would remain grey until April and the greyness was not an absence of colour but a colour itself, the pervasive, suffocating grey that was London's contribution to the emotional spectrum, the grey that entered buildings through single-glazed windows and settled on surfaces and on people and on the interior architecture of the mind.

Priya Sharma sat at the kitchen table in the flat she shared with two other medical students in a converted warehouse on Tanner Street, SE1, and the table was covered with paper.

The paper was the evidence. The paper was the reconstruction. The paper was the project that she had been building since she landed at Heathrow thirty hours ago, since she cleared customs and turned on her phone and found three missed calls from Tomoko and two from a Malaysian number she didn't recognise and a text from Razak that said only *Priya. Call me now.* and she had stood in the arrivals hall at Terminal 4 with the phone pressed to her ear and the crowds flowing around her and Razak had told her and the telling had taken forty-seven seconds and in those forty-seven seconds the world had changed, the atoms of the world had rearranged themselves into a configuration that did not include Connor Briggs alive on the earth, and the rearrangement had activated something in her that was not grief, not yet, not the grief that would come later when the adrenaline subsided and the project was done and there was nothing left to build, but something harder, something colder, something that her medical training had given a vocabulary for but that no training could prepare a person to feel.

"Dead," Razak had said. "In the cell. Last night. The police are saying suicide."

She had stood in arrivals. The arrivals hall at Heathrow Terminal 4 smelled of jet fuel and floor polish and the accumulated exhalation of a thousand passengers. A family was reuniting next to her -- a man lifting a child, a woman crying with happiness, the sound of the happy crying entering Priya's ears at the same moment as the word *dead* and the two sounds existing simultaneously in the same airspace, the sound of reunion and the sound of permanent separation occupying the same cubic centimetre of air.

She had not cried then. She had not cried in the taxi home. She had cried at 2:17 AM, alone in her bedroom, when she had written the words *Feb 14, 02:17 AM MYT -- body discovered in Cell C-7* and the specificity of the time had broken something that the word *dead* had not broken, because the word was abstract and the time was specific and the cell number was a location -- a three-by-three-metre concrete room with a fluorescent light that never turned off -- and she had been asleep on a plane over the Bay of Bengal at 2:17 AM and she had been asleep while he was dying and the sleeping was the thing that undid her, the sleeping was the betrayal, the failure of her body to know across eleven time zones that the person she loved was fighting for his life in a cell in Dang Wangi.

She was a fourth-year medical student at King's College London. She had completed rotations in emergency medicine, in surgery, in oncology. She had seen death in the clinical context -- the controlled, documented, institutionally managed cessation of life that occurred in hospitals. She had held the hand of an eighty-four-year-old man in his final hours because his family was in traffic on the M25 and someone needed to be there.

She understood death. The physiology. The bureaucracy. The paperwork.

The understanding made the emotional understanding worse.

Because she knew what ligature strangulation did to the body -- the compression of the carotid arteries, the loss of consciousness in eight to twelve seconds, the irreversible brain damage in four to six minutes. She knew the physical sensations -- the pressure, the panic, the involuntary struggle, the narrowing of vision. She knew these things because she had studied them, and the knowledge that had been abstract and academic was now specific and personal and applied to a throat she had kissed, to a neck she had rested her head against on a rooftop in Kuala Lumpur while the Petronas Towers glittered and he had said something stupid and wonderful and she had laughed and the laughing had been the sound of a woman falling in love with a man she knew was doomed and could not stop falling because love did not consult the evidence before making its decisions.

She knew what the towel had done. She knew the timeline -- the seconds, the minutes, the physiological stages. She could narrate the death with medical precision, and the precision was a knife, and the knife was inside her, and the knife turned every time she thought about the blue towel, the blue Sea to Summit microfiber towel that he had hung on the bunk rail every night and that she had used once, wrapped around herself after a shower in the hostel's perpetually damp bathroom, the towel that had smelled of sunscreen and salt water and him.

The jade bracelet on her left wrist caught the grey light from the kitchen window. The bracelet was green -- the deep, cool, translucent green of nephrite jade, the green that the night market vendor had called *lucky green, very good fortune*, the green that Connor had pointed to and said "That one, the green one, it matches her" and had paid forty ringgit for without bargaining, the only time in six weeks that Connor Briggs had not bargained, the only purchase he had made in Malaysia where the price asked was the price paid, because the bracelet was for her and for her the rules were different and the difference was love and the love was the thing she wore on her wrist and could not remove because removing it would be an ending and she was not ready for endings.

The bracelet was cool against her skin. The bracelet was always cool. Jade held the temperature of its environment, and the environment was a flat in Bermondsey in February, and the temperature was cold.

The grief would come. The grief was already coming -- she could feel it in the periphery, the way you could feel a migraine approaching before it arrived, the aura that preceded the pain. But not yet. The grief was being held at bay by the project, by the paper on the table, by the work.

---

The paper on the table was arranged in columns. The columns were chronological. The columns were labelled in Priya's handwriting -- small, precise, the handwriting of a medical student who had learned that legibility was not optional.

Column 1: DATES. Every date that mattered, from Connor's arrival at the Lantern Hostel (Day 1, January 1) to his death (Day 47, February 14). Forty-seven days, each one a row, each row annotated with what she knew had happened.

Column 2: DELIVERIES. Every delivery she had confirmed or suspected. Day 6: envelope to Bukit Bintang. Day 9: package to Brickfields. Day 11 onwards: scheduled deliveries, locations listed where known. Day 47: suitcase, bus to Penang, 450 grams of methamphetamine.

Column 3: PEOPLE. Felix Decker. Wei. Rizal. Guard Hafiz. Inspector Kamal. Every name Connor had mentioned to her, every name she had overheard, every name she had inferred from three weeks of watching a man she loved walk deeper into something she couldn't name but could feel.

Column 4: EVIDENCE. Tomoko's photographs. Mei Ling's booking records. Razak's cooperation. Connor's own Instagram -- @ConnorGoesGlobal, 4,200 followers, the curated digital life of a man who had documented his own entrapment in sunset filters and nine-hashtag captions without knowing it. The @HostelReaper posts. Connor's bank records. Felix's flight record (MH752, KL to Phnom Penh, 04:15 AM, February 14, the same morning, the same hours).

Column 5: WHAT THE REPORT SAYS. Suicide while in custody.

Column 6: WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Murder.

She adjusted her glasses. She had been wearing her glasses for thirty hours straight because her eyes were too swollen from the 2:17 AM crying to tolerate contact lenses, the crying that happened in bursts, unpredictable, the body releasing grief in controlled detonations while the mind continued working, one building and one destroying, one constructing the case and one processing the loss.

She picked up her phone.

The call to Sergeant Ahmad connected on the fourth ring.

"Pejabat Polis Dang Wangi. Sergeant Ahmad."

"Sergeant Ahmad, this is Priya Sharma. I sent you a letter. From London. About Connor Briggs and the Lantern Hostel."

Half a second of silence. Priya heard him shift in his chair, heard the ambient noise of the police station -- the phones, the footsteps, the hum of air conditioning -- and within the ambient noise, the specific silence of a man who was about to have a conversation that he could not have freely but would have carefully.

"Miss Sharma. Yes. I received your letter. This morning."

"Then you know it wasn't suicide."

Another pause. This one longer. The length of the pause was the length of a man choosing his words with the precision that his position demanded, the precision that distinguished a statement from an implication, a fact from an opinion, an official position from a personal belief.

"I can confirm that an investigation has been opened into the circumstances of Mr. Briggs's death. I cannot provide details about the investigation at this time."

"He was murdered. In your station. In a cell in your station. By a man named Rizal who was placed in the cell to kill him, who used Connor's own towel -- a towel that should have been confiscated during processing under SOP 14.2.3 -- and who was released two hours after the body was discovered. The guard on duty took a bribe. The report was filed by the same inspector who authorised Rizal's release. Felix Decker, the man who recruited Connor into the trafficking network, boarded a flight to Cambodia before the body was officially found."

The silence that followed was not the silence of a man who was hearing new information. The silence was the silence of a man who was recalibrating his assessment of the person on the other end of the phone, the recalibration that occurred when a professional who had been evaluating people for twenty years encountered someone who had done the homework, who had the evidence, who was not the bereaved partner he might have expected but was instead a precise, controlled, furious intelligence pointing itself at his case like an instrument.

"Miss Sharma. I want to be clear about something. Off the record."

"I'm listening."

"The official report was filed by an officer who is not part of my division. The investigation I am conducting is separate. It is looking at the full circumstances -- the detention, the cell assignment, the guard's conduct, the cellmate's background, and the network. This investigation is active and it is progressing. But it takes time. Evidence must be gathered properly. Legal standards must be met. The people responsible -- all of them, not just the ones in the cell -- must be identified and charged through a process that will hold up in court. Do you understand?"

"I understand. I also understand that every day that passes is a day that Felix Decker spends in Cambodia and a day that the official report says suicide and a day that the truth stays on page seven."

The reference to page seven was deliberate. Tomoko had sent Priya a photograph of the article in The Star -- the article she had found online three hours after the phone call from Razak, the article she had found by searching "Connor Briggs Malaysia" and "death custody Dang Wangi" and "Australian drug trafficking KL," the searches producing a single result, a single article, six paragraphs on page seven of a Saturday newspaper, 147 words between a condominium advertisement and a water main break.

She had read the 147 words on her phone screen, the jade bracelet cold on her wrist, and the words had produced a sensation that was not grief and was not anger but was something between the two, something in the territory where the emotional response to injustice was indistinguishable from the emotional response to loss.

*FOREIGN NATIONAL DIES IN POLICE CUSTODY.* Six paragraphs. Connor James Briggs, 27, of Melbourne. Suicide by hanging. Standard procedures.

"Miss Sharma." Ahmad's voice was careful now, the careful of a man making a decision. "Please send your detailed statement to my direct email. Everything you have -- dates, names, locations, observations, documentation. Everything."

"I already have it prepared. Twelve pages. Single-spaced."

"Of course you do."

The sentence was not sarcasm. The sentence was recognition -- the first moment of professional respect between a Malaysian narcotics sergeant and a British-Indian medical student, the respect that emerged when two people who were separately pursuing the same truth discovered that their pursuits were converging.

"And Sergeant Ahmad -- I want you to know that I intend to contact SUARAM. And the press. And the families of previous victims, if the pattern is what I think it is."

A pause. The pause of a police officer weighing the utility of an activist against the complications of one.

"I cannot advise you on your personal actions, Miss Sharma. I can tell you that the investigation benefits from public pressure. Off the record."

"Understood."

She hung up. She sat at the table. She opened her laptop. The statement was already written -- twelve pages, the medical-student precision of every date, every delivery, every conversation, every warning ignored. The statement was not emotional. The statement was clinical. The statement was the anatomy of a murder, dissected and labelled with the same care that a medical student brought to the dissection of a cadaver.

She attached the document. She pressed send. The email left London at 11:47 AM GMT. It arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 7:47 PM MYT. It was the second piece of ammunition that Ahmad's investigation had received that day -- the first being Priya's letter, the letter she had posted at Heathrow before boarding her flight home, the letter that had arrived at Dang Wangi on the morning of February 14, seventeen hours before Connor's death was discovered, the letter that had been on time and too late simultaneously, the letter that was the right action at the wrong time.

---

The second call was to SUARAM.

SUARAM -- Suara Rakyat Malaysia, the Voice of the Malaysian People -- was a human rights organisation based in Petaling Jaya that had been documenting deaths in Malaysian police custody for thirty-seven years. Two hundred and fifty-seven documented cases since 2000. Priya had found them through a Google search at 2:00 AM, the night when sleep was not available and the alternative to sleep was research.

A case coordinator named Fatimah answered. Her voice carried not desensitisation but calibration -- the adjustment of the emotional register to a level that was empathetic without being overwhelmed, the register of a person who had heard this kind of call many times.

"SUARAM, Fatimah speaking."

"My name is Priya Sharma. I'm calling from London. My partner, Connor Briggs, was found dead in a holding cell at Dang Wangi police station on February 14th. The official report says suicide. It was murder."

Fatimah did not ask for proof. Fatimah said: "Tell me everything."

Priya told her. The telling took forty-seven minutes -- a minute per day, she would realise later, though the symmetry was a coincidence and not a plan. She told Fatimah about Felix, about the deliveries, about the escalation from envelope to package to backpack to suitcase, about the towel that should not have been in the cell, about the cellmate, about the guard's absence.

"The towel being in the cell is significant," Fatimah said. "SOP 14.2.3 requires removal of all ligature-risk items. In our records, sixty-three percent of hanging deaths in custody involved a ligature that should have been removed during processing. The failure is either negligence or complicity."

"I believe there are other victims. The same pattern. The same cellmate."

"We'll file a formal inquiry with the Inspector General of Police. We'll request the full incident report, the guard's duty log, the cell assignment records, and the release documentation. We'll also request the post-mortem -- the autopsy may contain evidence inconsistent with suicide."

Defensive injuries. The phrase activated the medical knowledge she had been both using and suffering from -- broken fingernails, abrasions from the victim's own hands trying to pull the ligature away, petechial haemorrhaging, bruising inconsistent with self-inflicted hanging. She knew Connor had fought. She knew this not from evidence but from knowing him, from knowing the body that had surfed and held her on a rooftop, the body that would not have submitted without the desperate, futile struggle that was the body's final argument against its own extinction.

"I'll send you everything I have," Priya said.

"And Miss Sharma -- the right to life is not conditional on innocence. Connor Briggs was entitled to the protection of the law. The law failed him."

Priya thanked her. She hung up. The flat in Bermondsey was still cold but the cold was now a background condition rather than a foreground sensation because the foreground was occupied by the sensation of mechanisms activating, of the process of accountability beginning to turn.

---

At 4:00 PM, Priya opened Connor's Instagram on her laptop.

@ConnorGoesGlobal. 4,200 followers. The last post: a selfie at a Petaling Street night market stall, the caption "KL, you absolute legend" and nine hashtags. The post had forty-seven likes. The post had been made six days before his death. The account was still live, still public, the digital ghost of a man who had curated his own trajectory toward destruction in golden-hour filters and #livingmybestlife captions.

She scrolled through the feed. The feed was a timeline no one had looked at yet because the feed was Instagram and Instagram was not where investigators looked. But the feed was evidence.

The early posts were the usual -- KLIA2 grin, Petronas Towers at sunset, nasi lemak with Mama Siti's hand at the frame's edge. The feed of a man becoming a city. Then:

Day 9: Connor and Felix on the rooftop. Felix's hand on Connor's shoulder. Caption: "New mate Felix. This bloke's been everywhere. Legend." Thirty-one likes, and not one of the thirty-one had looked at that hand and seen a handler establishing contact with a recruit.

Day 14: The jade bracelet on Priya's wrist, the jade green against her brown skin, the night market lights blurred behind. Caption: "She said she didn't want anything. I said the bracelet did." Forty-four likes. His most-liked post. The only one where the caption was not performing.

Day 38: the last photograph. A sunset from the hostel rooftop, no caption, no hashtags. Just the sky and the city and the silence of a man who had, perhaps, run out of words.

Priya took screenshots. Every post. Every photograph. Every caption. Every date. She organised them chronologically in a folder on her desktop. The folder was labelled CONNOR -- INSTAGRAM EVIDENCE. The folder would be sent to Ahmad, to SUARAM, to the journalist she was about to contact.

Then she opened a new browser tab. She logged into her own Instagram -- @priya.s.sharma, 312 followers, mostly medical school friends and family. She had not posted in three months. She did not use social media the way Connor had used it, the way a generation used it, as a mirror and a megaphone and a substitute for the interior life that the platform simultaneously demanded and destroyed.

She created a new post. The image was Connor's Day 14 photograph -- the jade bracelet on her wrist. She had saved it months ago, when he posted it, when she was still at the hostel, when she had seen it in her feed and had smiled and had not known that the photograph would become an artefact, a relic, the digital equivalent of a saint's bone, the evidence that a person had existed and had loved and had been loved.

The caption she wrote was not @ConnorGoesGlobal's voice. The caption was Priya's voice. The caption was precise and it was controlled and it was the opening salvo of a campaign that she was building in real time, the campaign that would give the machinery a name and the name would be a hashtag and the hashtag would be the thing that moved the story from page seven to the place where stories that mattered lived.

*Connor James Briggs, 27, from Melbourne, Australia, died on February 14, 2026, in a police holding cell at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur. The official report says suicide. It was not suicide. He was murdered.*

*Connor was my partner. Connor was a person -- not a case file, not a headline, not a statistic. He was kind and he was careless and he was loved. He was manipulated by a drug trafficking network that used him as a mule and then killed him when he was arrested because dead men can't testify.*

*The Malaysian police report is a lie. The 147-word article on page 7 of The Star is not the story. This is the story. Connor deserves the truth and the truth requires your attention.*

*#JusticeForConnor #DeathInCustody #ConnorBriggs #DangWangi*

She posted it. The post went live at 4:47 PM GMT, 12:47 AM MYT. The algorithm would decide whether a jade bracelet and a dead man and the word *murdered* constituted the kind of content that generated the engagement metrics the platform rewarded with visibility.

The algorithm decided yes.

By midnight the post had been shared 340 times. By morning, 2,100. The hashtag #JusticeForConnor appeared in the feeds of human rights organisations, travel bloggers, Australian media accounts, Malaysian civil society groups. A journalist from The Age in Melbourne screenshotted the post and wrote a 1,200-word article: "British Medical Student Claims Aussie Backpacker Was Murdered in Malaysian Custody." The article was on page three. The article named Felix Decker. The article quoted SUARAM. Twelve times the length of the 147-word piece in The Star.

Priya watched the numbers from her kitchen table. The accumulation of attention was a form of pressure, and the pressure was the thing that institutions responded to not because they had consciences but because they had public relations departments, and the metrics included the number of times an institution's name appeared in proximity to the word *murder*, and the number was rising.

---

The call to Karen Briggs was the hardest.

She had saved it for last. She had made the other calls first -- to Ahmad, to SUARAM, to the British consulate, to a journalist at The Star named Lim Wei Ling whose byline had appeared on the 147-word article -- she had made these calls because these calls had structure, because these calls had objectives, because these calls engaged the part of her brain that was trained and competent and capable. These calls were work. The call to Karen was not work. The call to Karen was the thing that no training prepared a person for.

She dialled the number. Connor had called his mother from Priya's phone once, on the rooftop, on a night when his phone was dead. He had dialled from memory -- the digits stored not in the phone but in the body, in the fingers that had dialled the number since childhood -- and Priya had seen the number on her call log and saved it, not knowing why.

Karen answered on the second ring. The speed of a woman answering every call because every call might contain new information.

"Hello?" The voice was stripped. Not the social voice, not the telephone voice. The voice that existed beneath all the other voices, produced when the social infrastructure had collapsed and all that remained was the mechanism -- the vocal cords, the breath, the words.

"Mrs. Briggs, this is Priya Sharma. I was... I knew Connor. In Kuala Lumpur."

"Priya." The name was spoken with recognition -- not from having met but from having been told. Connor had mentioned her to his mother on one of the Sunday calls, the calls he answered every third week, the curated, abbreviated narration that children used with parents, and Priya had been one of the good parts. "He told me about you. He said you were brilliant. He said you were the smartest person he'd ever met."

The information arrived in Priya's body and the processing produced the tears -- the involuntary release that occurred when the emotional stimulus exceeded the cognitive capacity. The tears were not a decision. The tears were a hydraulic event. She let them come because the tears were the body's way of doing what the mind could not, which was to acknowledge the magnitude of the loss.

"Karen. I need to tell you something about how Connor died. And I need you to listen, because what I'm going to tell you is different from what the police report says."

"I know." The words were immediate. The words were the words of a mother who had known since the phone call at 3 AM, who had heard the word *suicide* and had rejected it the way a body rejected a foreign organ, immediately, completely, at the cellular level. "I know it wasn't suicide. David knows. We both know. Connor would not have... he was not... he was many things, Priya, he was careless and stubborn and infuriating and he didn't listen, God knows he didn't listen, but he was not that. He wouldn't have."

"He didn't."

The two words travelled from London to Melbourne and the two words were the confirmation of what Karen already believed and the confirmation changed nothing and changed everything, the way a diagnosis changed nothing about the disease but changed everything about the patient's relationship to the disease, the naming of the thing giving the thing a shape that could be grasped and, eventually, fought.

Priya told her. The controlled, precise language. Felix. The deliveries. Rizal. The towel. The guard. The investigation. SUARAM. The statement.

Karen listened. Karen's listening was the listening of a mother -- the filter that converted every fact into a felt experience, every element of the story into a moment in the life of a child she had borne and raised and loved and worried about and sent money to and called every Sunday and not heard from often enough and lost.

When Priya finished, the silence was the silence of two women in two cities on two continents who loved the same man and who were both refusing to let the destruction be the end of the story.

"We're flying to KL," Karen said. "David and I. To bring him home."

"I know. The High Commission's Sarah Chen -- I've been in contact with her. She'll meet you."

"Will you be there?"

The question was the extension of a hand across twelve thousand kilometres. Priya looked at the jade bracelet on her wrist. She looked at the paper on the table. She looked at the grey February light pressing against the kitchen window.

"My term starts Monday. My clinical placements..."

"Of course. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have--"

"No. Wait." The word came before the decision, or perhaps the word was the decision, the body making the choice before the mind could intervene with logistics and obligations and the reasonable objections that reasonable people offered when unreasonable things were asked of them. "I'll come. I need to come. The evidence I have, the contacts -- Ahmad, SUARAM, Tomoko at the hostel -- I need to be there. I can defer the placement. I'll speak to my supervisor."

The decision was not rational. The decision was the decision of a woman who had sent a letter from Heathrow and the letter had arrived seventeen hours too late and the lateness was the thing she carried. She had left KL and Connor had died. The leaving was the thing she could not undo but could answer with the inverse action -- the return, the going back to the place where the loss had occurred to ensure that the loss was not also a silence.

"Thank you," Karen said. "Thank you."

"And Karen?"

"Yes?"

"He talked about you. Every day. Not on the phone -- on the phone he was performing. But in person, when it was just us, when it was late and he wasn't performing, he talked about you. Sunday roasts. The cricket on TV. Vegemite toast when he came home from school. He talked about you the way people talk about the thing they love most and are most afraid of losing."

The sound that Karen made was not the sound she had made in the hallway at 3 AM. That sound had been the sound of a mother learning her child was dead. This sound was different. This sound was the sound of a mother learning her child had loved her, had spoken of her with tenderness to a woman he cared about, had carried her in the part of himself that was not the Instagram persona, not the digital nomad, not @ConnorGoesGlobal, but the boy from Hawthorn who missed his mother's Vegemite toast.

The sound was private. Priya held it the way she had been trained to hold the sounds that patients made -- with presence, with silence, with the understanding that some sounds required not a response but a witness.

"Will they catch the people who did this?" Karen asked.

"I'm going to make sure of it."

The words were a declaration of intent made by a woman who had arranged the evidence on her kitchen table and made four phone calls and written a twelve-page statement and launched a hashtag that was, at this moment, converting the 147-word page-seven silence into noise, into visibility, into the pressure that moved stories from the margins to the centre.

Justice was not enough. Justice was never enough. Justice was the consolation prize that the living gave to the dead, the acknowledgement that the system had failed and the failure would be documented and the documentation would be called accountability -- partial, insufficient, necessary. Necessary because the alternative was nothing, and nothing was not acceptable, and the refusal to accept nothing was the engine that drove the campaign, the anger that Priya Sharma carried in her chest like a second heart, beating alongside the first, generating the energy that grief alone could not provide.

---

She hung up the phone. She sat at the table. The paper was still there. The columns were still there. The evidence was still there.

She opened her laptop. On the screen, the #JusticeForConnor post was accumulating. The numbers were rising. The system was responding. The story was migrating.

She opened a new email. The email was to Lim Wei Ling, the journalist at The Star. The email would be the beginning of a professional relationship that would last months, that would result in investigative articles that moved from page seven to page three to page one, that would name Felix Decker and the network and the pattern of deaths in custody, that would cite SUARAM's records and Priya's statement and Tomoko's photographs, that would force the Inspector General of Police to convene a special inquiry.

But that was the future. That was weeks and months of the slow, grinding process of a truth migrating from the margins to the centre, from 147 words to fourteen thousand.

For now, Priya typed. The flat was cold. The grey was at the windows. The jade bracelet was cool on her wrist. The paper was on the table. The second heart was beating.

She had a flight to book.

*End of Chapter 42*
