# Chapter 46: The Photographs

The story ran on Tuesday.

Not page 7 this time. Not the brief, three-paragraph mention that Malaysian newspapers typically gave to deaths in custody -- the mention that was the system's acknowledgment of the event and the system's containment of the event, the mention that said *yes, this happened* in a voice quiet enough that the saying could be denied if the saying became inconvenient. Not the kind of story that appeared and disappeared in the same news cycle, consumed by the next day's headlines, digested by the public's appetite for new information and expelled from memory before the week was out.

Front page.

The Star led with the story. The headline ran across the full width of the page, above the fold, in the black bold typeface that The Star reserved for the stories that could not be contained in the body of the paper, the stories that demanded the architecture of the front page.

The headline said:

**DEATH IN CUSTODY: PHOTOS REVEAL DRUG NETWORK AT KL HOSTEL**

Below the headline, three photographs. The photographs were Tomoko's. The photographs were the fifty-nine frames reduced to three, the editorial selection that converted a photojournalist's body of work into the three images that told the story in the language that newspapers spoke most fluently -- the language of the visual, the image that the eye consumed before the mind engaged, the photograph that made the reader stop and read the text below.

Photograph one: Felix Decker at Wei's phone repair shop, seen through the window, Day 9. Felix in profile, his angular face lit by the shop's fluorescent strip light, his hand on the counter, Wei visible behind him, the shelves of phone cases and the door to the back room. The photograph was sharp, composed, the work of a professional photographer who had stood across the street with a long lens and captured the moment with the precision that separated documentation from art. The caption identified Felix as a German national wanted in connection with Connor's death. The photograph made Felix real -- not a name in a police statement but a face, a body, a man caught in the act of the mundane transaction that was the architecture of trafficking: two men in a shop, one counter between them, fluorescent light above.

Photograph two: Connor Briggs on Petaling Street, Day 10, a brown-paper package under his arm. He was walking. His face was visible -- the dirty blonde hair, the squint, the board shorts, the braided leather bracelet. He was walking with the unselfconscious stride of a man who did not know he was being photographed and did not know the package under his arm contained a substance that carried the mandatory death penalty and did not know that the walk he was taking was being documented by a woman with a camera who was building a case he didn't know existed about a crime he didn't know he was committing. The photograph was the last image of Connor Briggs as a free man. The photograph was the before. Everything after the photograph was the after.

Photograph three: The Lantern Hostel. The facade -- the narrow door, the red lantern, the pre-war plasterwork. The photograph was taken at night. The lantern was lit. The glow was warm and red and the glow was the hostel's face, the face it showed to the street, the invitation that it extended to every traveller who passed. The photograph was beautiful. The photograph was the photograph of a place that looked like shelter and had been a trap. Readers would linger on this photograph longest -- the image that made the ordinary sinister, that converted a building into a character, that said *this is where it happened* in the visual grammar of true crime that turned locations into landmarks of the terrible.

In the newsroom at The Star's offices in Petaling Jaya, Lim Wei Jie -- the crime beat reporter who had written the story, who had covered deaths in custody before, other deaths, other cells, other families -- watched the print run come in and held the front page in his hands. The ink was fresh. The photographs were vivid -- Tomoko's work reproduced at a resolution that preserved the detail, the grain, the quality that elevated the images from documentation to evidence. The newsroom around him was quiet in the way that newsrooms were quiet when they knew the paper had a story that would move -- the hush of journalists watching a colleague's work hit the street, the professional respect that replaced the usual noise of keyboards and phones and the ambient cynicism that was the newsroom's default emotional register.

Lim had been writing this story for years, in different iterations, with different names and different nationalities and different cells. This time the story had photographs. This time the story had a name that was not Malaysian. This time the story had an international dimension that converted a local death-in-custody story into a story that crossed borders.

The story was 2,400 words. It occupied the front page and continued on pages 4 and 5, with additional photographs and a sidebar headlined "Malaysia's Deaths in Custody: The Numbers." The sidebar listed 257 deaths in police and prison custody between 2000 and 2026, of which 89 were classified as suicide, and of which 14 had subsequently been reclassified following investigations or inquests. The numbers were the numbers that the system produced when the system was asked to account for itself, and the numbers were simultaneously the evidence of the problem and the evidence of the system's capacity to absorb the problem without changing.

By noon, the hashtag #JusticeForConnor was trending. By evening, the story had crossed borders -- The Guardian, ABC Australia, the BBC, twelve countries, several hundred thousand readers -- and the story was no longer a story about one person in one cell but a story about a system. The story had escaped the containment of page 7. The story was everywhere.

The Lantern Hostel was besieged by journalists on Wednesday morning.

They arrived at seven AM, the first of them -- a camera crew from TV3, the Malaysian television network, a reporter and a cameraman and a sound technician, the three-person unit that was the basic architecture of television journalism, the minimum crew required to convert a location into a story, a building into a backdrop, a doorway into a stage.

By eight AM, there were six crews. By nine, there were twelve. The narrow lane off Petaling Street, which was ordinarily the quiet passage between the phone repair shop and the Chinese medicine store, was now a corridor of cameras and microphones and the frenetic, self-generating energy of a media event, the energy that was generated when multiple news organisations converged on the same point and the convergence created a feedback loop -- each crew's presence justifying every other crew's presence, the collective attention validating the individual attention, the physics of news gathering producing its own gravity.

Mei Ling stood at the reception desk and turned them away.

She turned them away with the efficiency of a woman who had spent two years standing at this desk and dealing with every kind of person who walked through the narrow door -- the drunk, the lost, the demanding, the entitled, the police, the health inspector, the occasional rat. The journalists were a new category but the skill set was the same: firm, polite, unyielding.

"The hostel is not giving interviews. Please direct your inquiries to the police."

"Is the owner available?"

"The owner is not available for comment."

"Can we see the room where Briggs stayed?"

"The hostel is a private establishment. Guests have a right to privacy."

"Is it true that the hostel was used as a base for drug trafficking?"

"Please direct your inquiries to the police."

The journalists filmed the facade. They filmed the red lantern. They filmed the narrow door. They filmed the lane and the phone repair shop -- sealed, padlocked, police tape -- and the Chinese medicine store and the Guan Di Temple at the corner. They filmed Petaling Street and the market stalls and the vendors who watched the filming with the bemused indifference of people who had been selling watches and handbags on this street for decades and had seen stranger things than a pack of journalists outside a hostel. One reporter did a piece to camera standing in front of the red lantern, the lantern framed behind her left shoulder, the iconic image already forming -- the lantern that would become the visual shorthand for the story, the way certain images attached themselves to certain stories and became inseparable from them, the lantern the story's logo.

Mei Ling watched from behind the desk. She had called Razak at 6:45 AM, when the first van pulled up. Razak had said: "Turn them away. Be polite. Say nothing." The instructions were clear. The execution was Mei Ling's, and Mei Ling executed with the practised competence of a woman who had grown up in the service industry in Kuala Lumpur and had learned early that the face you showed to the world was not the face you wore behind it. Her face showed calm. Behind the calm was the calculation of a person who had worked at this hostel for two years and who was now calculating the number of weeks of employment she had remaining, the calculation producing a number that was smaller than she wanted and larger than she feared.

Inside the hostel, the guests watched from the common room window. The French girl from Bed 7 sat on the sofa and watched the cameras through the glass and she did not know why the cameras were there because she had not read the newspaper and did not know the history of the bed she slept in and did not know that the building she was staying in was now famous for the terrible reason that buildings became famous when someone died in them. A German backpacker, newly arrived, stood behind her and filmed the journalists on his phone, filming the people who were filming the building, the recursive loop of documentation that the media age produced when events attracted attention and the attention attracted more attention and the multiplication was infinite.

Razak gave one interview, to The Star, to Lim Wei Jie. His confession -- "I chose money over morality. I am responsible." -- ran as the next day's headline on page 4, the quote extracted and enlarged across two columns, the sentence that was simple and damning and human in a way that the rest of the story was not.

The PDRM issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon.

The statement was read by a press officer at a press conference at Bukit Aman, the national police headquarters. The press officer was a woman in her forties, uniformed, professional, the face and voice of the institution that was being asked to account for a death that had occurred within its custody. She read from a prepared text -- the language measured, careful, legalistic, the language that said everything and nothing, that acknowledged without admitting, that addressed without answering.

"The Royal Malaysia Police takes all deaths in custody seriously. The death of Mr. Connor James Briggs at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters is under active investigation. A murder inquiry has been opened. Two arrests have been made in connection with the case. International warrants have been issued for two additional suspects. The investigation is ongoing. No further details can be provided at this time."

The journalists asked questions. The questions probed the gap between the statement and the reality, the gap that the statement was designed to close and that the questions were designed to keep open.

"Is it true that the initial report classified the death as suicide?"

"The initial report reflected the preliminary assessment. The subsequent investigation has led to the current classification."

"How many deaths in custody have been initially classified as suicide and later reclassified?"

"I don't have that information available at this time."

"Is there any connection between this case and other deaths in custody involving the suspect known as Rizal?"

"The investigation is ongoing. No further details can be provided."

"Will there be an inquest?"

"The matter of an inquest is for the coroner to determine."

Twelve minutes. The press conference lasted twelve minutes and produced twelve minutes of the unsatisfying, choreographed theatre of institutional accountability -- questions asked and not answered, the not-answering itself the answer, the institutional voice saying *we acknowledge the event, we are investigating the event, we cannot discuss the event*, the opacity that was the system's defence against the light that the questions brought. The press officer left the podium. The journalists packed their equipment. The footage would air on the evening news and the footage would show what it always showed -- a podium, a uniform, a prepared text, the choreography of a system performing accountability without being accountable, the dance that the system had perfected over decades and that the press conference format enabled because the format was designed for statements, not for truth, and the twelve minutes were the system's statement and the statement was: *we are here, we are speaking, and the speaking is the thing we are offering you in place of the thing you are asking for*.

The Malaysian Home Minister was asked about the case on Thursday, during Question Time in Parliament.

The question came from a member of the opposition from Petaling Jaya, a woman named Siti Mariam who had been asking questions about deaths in custody for six years -- the same questions, the same answers, the same gap between the asking and the answering that never closed. She had a folder on her desk. The folder contained the names of families who had written to her office, the names of the dead and the names of the living who carried the dead, the names that were the human substance of the statistics that the government declined to cite.

"Yang Berhormat Menteri, in light of the recent death of Australian national Connor Briggs at Dang Wangi police station, and the subsequent opening of a murder investigation, can the Minister confirm how many deaths in police custody have occurred in the past five years, and how many of those deaths were initially classified as suicide?"

The Home Minister stood. He had developed the particular skill of responding to questions without answering them -- the practised art of the public figure who understood that every word spoken in Parliament was recorded and every record was permanent.

"Every death in custody is investigated," the Home Minister said. "The government takes the welfare of detainees seriously. The case of Mr. Briggs is under active investigation by the Royal Malaysia Police. I have every confidence in the investigation. The government's commitment to the rule of law and to the rights of all persons in custody is unwavering."

He did not say how many deaths there had been. He did not mention the number 257. He did not mention the 89 classified as suicide. He did not mention the 14 that had been reclassified, or the 75 that had not -- the 75 that remained on the books as suicides, that existed now only in folders in filing cabinets and in the memories of families who believed what Priya believed and what the Briggs family believed, that the word *suicide* was a wall and behind the wall was a different word.

He did not mention the three other deaths that Rizal was connected to -- Taiping in 2022, Johor Bahru in 2023, Shah Alam in 2024 -- deaths that had been classified as suicides and that were now being reviewed, the files reopened, the investigations re-initiated by a system that was being forced, by the pressure of a front-page story and international attention that a dead Australian generated in a way that dead Malaysians often did not, to look again at the things it had chosen not to see.

He said: "Every death in custody is investigated."

Siti Mariam sat down. She placed her hands on the folder. The folder remained closed. The names inside the folder remained unspoken. The names would be spoken another day, in another Question Time, the cycle continuing -- the asking and the not-answering and the gap between them that was the space in which the families waited.

The non-answer was recorded in Hansard. The recording was the democracy's method of preserving the non-answer for future reference, the record that said: *this question was asked, and this was what was said, and what was said was not what was asked, and the gap between the two is the gap that persists*.

At Kajang Prison, fifty kilometres south of Kuala Lumpur, a woman named Nurul -- Mama Siti's niece, mid-twenties, fourteen months into a sentence for trafficking under Section 39B -- read a two-day-old copy of The Star that had been passed hand to hand through the informal distribution system of the prison.

She read about the Lantern Hostel. She read about Petaling Street. She read about Felix Decker. She read about Connor Briggs, a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had been recruited in the same hostel where she had been recruited two years earlier, by a man who was not Felix but who was Felix's predecessor, the previous handler, the previous occupant of the private room on the third floor.

She had been silent for fourteen months. The silence was survival -- the network had people inside the prison, and the people who spoke about the network were the people who were silenced, in cells, at night, with towels or sheets or the improvised ligatures that the system's failures made available.

She read about Mama Siti. The newspaper mentioned Mama Siti only in passing -- "the hostel's long-serving cook" -- but the mention was enough. The mention was the name that Nurul knew, the name that was not just a name but a history, the history of a family that had been entangled in the network's operations through the building where the family's matriarch cooked and the building's owner had made an arrangement and in that space Nurul had been recruited, two years ago, by the previous handler, the previous occupant of the private room on the third floor.

She put the newspaper down. She sat on her bed and looked at the wall and the wall was concrete and the concrete was the same colour as the concrete of every cell in every prison in Malaysia and the colour was the colour of containment.

She made a decision. The decision was not sudden. The decision had been forming for fourteen months, the way a stalactite formed -- slowly, invisibly, the accumulation of drops, each drop too small to be a decision but the accumulation eventually producing a structure that was a decision, a solid thing, a thing with shape and weight and consequence.

She called for the guard.

"I want to speak to a lawyer," Nurul said. "From SUARAM."

The word changed the guard's expression. SUARAM -- Suara Rakyat Malaysia -- was the human rights organisation that had been documenting deaths in custody for decades, the organisation that existed on the other side of the wall that separated the system from the people who questioned the system.

"I want to give a statement," Nurul said. "About the network. About the hostel. About the man who recruited me. About the man who recruited the Australian. About all of it."

The guard left to file the request. The request would take days. But the request had been made and the making was the first sound after fourteen months of silence, the first word in a statement that would add to the case that Ahmad was building -- the case that had started with Priya's letter and Tomoko's photographs and Razak's confession and that was growing, document by document, into the mass that the system required to hold itself accountable.

Nurul lay on her bed. The fluorescent light buzzed -- the same light that had been on in Connor's cell, the universal light of custody, the light that illuminated without warming, that was on when the living were there and on when the dead were there. She thought about the decision she had made. The decision was dangerous. The decision might get her killed in the same way that Connor Briggs had been killed. But the decision had been made and the making was irreversible.

The story was out. The story could not be put back. The story was the light that the system had tried to prevent by calling the death a suicide and filing the report and closing the case and moving on. The light was on the front page and on the internet and in the Parliament and in the prison and in the cell where Nurul lay with her eyes closed and her decision made, and the decision was a light too, a small light, the light of one person choosing to speak after fourteen months of choosing not to, the light that was not enough to illuminate everything but was enough to illuminate something, and the something was a start, and the start was the thing that the system feared most.

The fluorescent light buzzed.

Nurul waited for the lawyer.

The story continued.
