# Chapter 50: Bed 7

Three months after Connor Briggs died in a cell at Dang Wangi, a young woman from New Zealand arrived at the Lantern Hostel on Petaling Street with a backpack and a ukulele and the conviction that Southeast Asia was going to change her life.

Her name was Sophie. She was twenty-three. She had arrived in Kuala Lumpur that morning on an AirAsia flight from Phnom Penh -- the same route that Felix Decker had taken three months earlier in the opposite direction, the airlines indifferent to the moral content of their passengers' itineraries.

She walked from Pasar Seni to Petaling Street, the same twelve minutes it had taken Connor Briggs, filming everything -- the motorcycles threading through traffic, the market vendors, the char kway teow sizzling on a corner stall, the red lanterns between buildings. Her phone was up, the lens always open, content for the 1,800 followers of @SophieGoesPlaces who expected bright, aspirational documentation of a young woman living her best life in places that were photogenic and affordable and safely exotic.

She reached the Lantern Hostel at twelve thirty. The building looked exactly as it had looked for ninety-seven years -- the pre-war shophouse facade, the narrow entrance, the red lanterns hanging above the doorway, the brass numbers 28 above the lintel. The building looked inviting. The building looked like the kind of place that backpackers described in reviews as "charming" and "authentic" and "full of character," the words that travellers used for buildings that were old and slightly decaying and cheaper than the alternatives.

She pushed open the door. The bell above the door rang -- the same bell, the same ring, the sound that had announced the arrival of every guest since the bell was installed in 1971, the sound that Mei Ling heard at the reception counter and identified, without looking up, as the arrival of a new guest, the sound that was the hostel's version of a heartbeat, the systolic event that pumped new blood into the building's circulatory system.

The lobby was cool. Not air-conditioned -- the hostel had never had air conditioning, the building's thick walls and narrow proportions and the air well at its centre providing the thermal regulation that pre-war architecture had achieved through design rather than technology. The lobby smelled of wood polish and incense and, faintly, of coconut rice from the kitchen, the scent that was Mama Siti's signature, the olfactory announcement that the kitchen was staffed and the cook was present and the building was alive.

Mei Ling looked up. Mei Ling's face was the same face it had always been -- the professional composure of a receptionist who had checked in thousands of guests and had learned to greet each one with the neutral, efficient warmth that the job required. But behind the composure, behind the professional surface, there was something else now. Something that had not been there before Connor. Something that lived in her eyes when she looked at new guests -- particularly young guests, particularly foreign guests, particularly the guests who arrived alone and broke and carrying the restless energy of a person who was looking for something and might find something they were not looking for.

"Welcome to the Lantern Hostel. Do you have a reservation?"

"Yeah, I booked online. Sophie Nakamura-Reeves. Four nights."

Mei Ling typed. The booking system showed the reservation. Dorm 3. Bed 7.

Mei Ling paused. The pause was imperceptible to Sophie -- a fraction of a second, the hesitation of a cursor before a keystroke, the delay between receiving information and acting on it. The delay was the time Mei Ling's mind took to register the bed number and the associations the bed number carried and the decision that the bed number required, the decision that was: assign the bed as booked, or change it.

She could change it. She could say Bed 7 was unavailable -- maintenance, cleaning, a leak from the floor above. She could assign Sophie to Bed 3 or Bed 5 or any of the other beds in Dorm 3 that were currently vacant. She could redirect one guest away from one bed in one room and the redirecting would be an act of superstition or an act of caution or an act of the kind of care that Mei Ling had decided, after Connor's death, to exercise more deliberately than before.

But the bed was a bed. The bed was wood and foam and vinyl. The bed was not cursed or haunted or marked by anything except the name carved into its frame, and the name was a name, and the name belonged to a woman who was in a prison, not a ghost, and the bed's history was the bed's history, not the bed's future, and assigning a bed based on the history of its previous occupants was not hospitality but fear.

"Dorm 3, Bed 7. Here's your key. Second floor. Breakfast is seven to nine."

Sophie took the key. She smiled. The smile was the smile of a young person checking into a hostel in Southeast Asia -- bright, open, the smile of someone who was about to climb a narrow staircase and enter a shared room and put their bag on a bunk and look out a window and think *this is it, this is travel, this is the life*.

"Oh, one more thing," Mei Ling said.

Sophie turned.

Mei Ling reached under the counter. She pulled out a laminated card -- a card that had not existed three months ago, a card that Mei Ling had designed and printed and laminated and placed at the reception counter as part of the hostel's new policy, the policy that Razak had implemented after the investigation, after the media, after the reopening.

The card read:

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR GUESTS**

*Under Malaysian law, the possession of 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, 15 grams or more of heroin, or 200 grams or more of cannabis is punishable by mandatory death.*

*Never carry packages, envelopes, bags, or luggage for another person.*

*If you are approached by anyone offering paid "delivery" or "courier" work, please report it to reception immediately.*

*If you feel unsafe, please contact:*
*Royal Malaysia Police: 999*
*Australian High Commission: +60 3 2146 5555*
*British High Commission: +60 3 2170 2200*
*US Embassy: +60 3 2168 5000*

*The management of the Lantern Hostel takes the safety of our guests seriously.*

Sophie read the card. Her expression changed -- the bright smile dimming to the sober attention of a person reading a warning, the shift from tourist to citizen, from performer to person. She read the card again.

"Heavy," she said.

"Please keep it," Mei Ling said. "And please read the poster in the common room. And if anyone -- *anyone* -- asks you to carry something, come to me. Immediately."

Sophie nodded. The nod was the nod of a person who was taking a warning seriously because the warning was delivered seriously, the tone of Mei Ling's voice carrying the weight of a woman who had issued warnings before and been ignored and had decided that the issuing would continue regardless of the ignoring because the issuing was the only tool she had.

Sophie climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked.

Dorm 3 was the same dorm it had always been. Eight bunks, four on each side, the arrangement of beds that the building had housed since the dormitory was created in the 1960s. The walls were the same plaster. The ceiling fan was the same fan. The air well's opening in the centre of the building admitted the same light and the same air and the same sounds from the floors above and below.

Bed 7 was on the right side, lower bunk, second from the back, by the window that overlooked the air well. The bed was made with white sheets -- the standard hostel sheets that Mei Ling changed between guests, the sheets that were the blank canvas on which every guest's story was temporarily written and then laundered away.

Sophie put her backpack on the bed. She sat on the mattress. The mattress was thin -- foam on vinyl, the standard hostel mattress that was comfortable enough for sleep and uncomfortable enough to ensure that guests spent their days outside the dorm, in the common room, in the streets, in the city, rather than in their beds.

She looked around. The dorm was empty -- the other beds unoccupied, their sheets flat and smooth, the bunks waiting. The ceiling fan turned overhead, its blades slightly warped, the wobble creating a rhythm that was the room's ambient soundtrack: *tick, tick, tick*. The sound of a clock that measured nothing but its own rotation.

She lay back. Her hand found the bed frame -- the wooden rail that ran along the side of the lower bunk, the rail that provided the minimal structure between the bed and the drop to the floor. Her fingers rested on the wood. The wood was smooth, worn by decades of hands gripping it as guests climbed in and out of the bunk.

Her fingers found a groove. A series of grooves. Four grooves, arranged in a line, each one the width and depth of a letter carved into wood with a fingernail or a coin.

L. E. N. A.

Sophie did not look at the grooves. Sophie's fingers registered the sensation -- the slight irregularity in the wood's surface, the carved channels that her fingertips traced without her conscious attention. The grooves were there. The letters were there. The name was there.

The name of a Swedish woman who had slept in this bed and carried packages for a German trafficker and been arrested at a bus station and was now in a prison waiting for a trial. The name that Connor Briggs had placed his hand on every morning for forty-seven days without reading it. The name that David Briggs had touched during his visit to the hostel and thought was just damage, just wear.

The name was still there. The name would be there when Sophie left. The name would be there when the next guest arrived, and the next, and the next. The name was carved into the wood and the wood was part of the building and the building was ninety-seven years old and would stand for years more, and the name would persist -- the small, stubborn testimony of a woman who had wanted someone to know she had been there.

Sophie did not read the name. Sophie was looking at the ceiling, at the fan, at the light from the air well. Sophie was thinking about dinner -- which hawker stall, which dish, whether to try the durian that her guidebook described as "an acquired taste that most visitors do not acquire." Sophie was thinking about the Instagram post she would make tonight -- the hostel, the dorm, the charming-authentic-character of a building that was older than her grandmother. Sophie was thinking about tomorrow and the next day and the four nights she had booked and the life that stretched ahead of her, unwritten, uncarved, the blank wood of a story that had not yet been told.

She got up. She went downstairs. She went to the common room.

The common room was occupied. A few guests -- a British couple planning their itinerary at the coffee table, a Japanese student reading in the armchair, a German woman writing postcards. The German woman was young, blonde, wearing a linen dress and sandals, and her presence in the common room carried no significance beyond the significance of a tourist in a hostel. The German woman was not Felix Decker. The German woman was not a recruiter. The German woman was writing postcards to her parents in Stuttgart.

But the common room had a poster now. The poster was on the wall beside the bookshelf, at eye level, laminated, the text in English and Malay and Mandarin:

**KNOW THE LAW. KNOW THE RISK.**

*Malaysia's Dangerous Drugs Act carries the mandatory death penalty for trafficking. This is not a joke. This is not negotiable. This is the law.*

*If you are offered "easy money" to carry packages, SAY NO. Report it. Leave.*

*The Lantern Hostel has zero tolerance for drug-related activity.*

The poster was Razak's idea. The poster was part of the agreement he had reached with Ahmad -- the agreement that allowed the hostel to remain open in exchange for Razak's full cooperation with the investigation and the implementation of measures to prevent future recruitment. The poster was the visible output of the agreement. The poster was also Razak's penance, the public acknowledgement of a complicity that had cost a girl her freedom and a boy his life.

Sophie saw the poster. She read it. She took a photo of it -- for Instagram, not for reference, the photo captioned *Malaysia doesn't mess around. #DrugLaws #Scary #TravelSafe*. The photo got 34 likes.

She sat on the sofa. She opened her guidebook. She began planning her evening -- Petaling Street's night market, char kway teow, the kind of experience she would document and share and her followers would like and the documentation would be the experience because that was the condition of modern travel. The condition that Connor Briggs had understood perfectly. The condition that his death had not altered because it was structural, not personal -- the system that produced Connors and Olivers and Sophies, the system that sent young people into the world with phones and confidence and the belief that the world was a playground rather than a mechanism.

At seven PM, Mama Siti prepared the evening meal.

The kitchen was hers. The kitchen had always been hers. The kitchen would remain hers for as long as she was alive and the building was standing and the stove produced flame and the rice steamed and the sambal burned and the nasi lemak emerged from her hands with the consistency and care that she had brought to every plate for thirty years.

She cooked. She cooked the way she had always cooked -- with attention, with precision, with the quiet authority of a woman who understood that food was not fuel but communication, that a plate of nasi lemak was not a meal but a message, and the message was: *I am here. I am watching. I care whether you eat.*

She set the plates on the counter. The plates were for the guests. The guests would come to the kitchen at seven and sit at the counter and eat and the eating would be the normalcy that the building required, the daily ritual that kept the building alive, the rhythm that the building's heart beat to.

She did not set an extra plate. She had stopped that on the eighth day, when the rain took the last one. But she paused, as she always paused now, at the end of the counter -- the position where Connor had stood every morning for forty-seven mornings. The position was empty. The position would remain empty. And the pause was the plate's ghost, the ceremony's echo, the grief that had been released but that the hands still remembered.

She cooked. She served. She watched the guests eat. And the pause at the end of the counter was the only mark of what had been -- not a plate but an absence, not a vigil but a habit, the muscle memory of caring for someone who was no longer there to be cared for.

The building held the memory. The building held it in the wood and the plaster and the tiles and the layers of paint under which the Japanese characters waited and the stories accumulated and the names were carved and the deaths were absorbed. The building's memory did not require a plate. The building remembered in its own language -- the squeak on the third step, the name on the bed frame, the air well that breathed, the ceiling fans that turned.

At nine PM, Sophie sat on the rooftop.

The rooftop was there. The plastic chairs were there. The zinc railing was there. The Petronas Towers were there -- silver-white against the night sky, the twin columns that dominated KL's skyline and provided the visual landmark that oriented every tourist and every resident and every person who had ever looked at the city and needed a fixed point.

Sophie sat in a plastic chair. She held her phone. She was composing an Instagram post. The photo was of the towers, taken from the rooftop, the angle showing the skyline and the night and the lights of a city that was beautiful in the way that all cities were beautiful from above -- the grid of lights, the movement of traffic, the collective luminosity of millions of lives generating the glow that replaced the stars.

She captioned the photo: *KL nights. This city is EVERYTHING. The hostel is so cute, staff are lovely, and the food is incredible. #KualaLumpur #BackpackerLife #LivingTheDream*

Living the dream. The same words from a different person in the same chair on the same rooftop, three months after the last person who used those words was strangled with his own towel in a cell three kilometres away.

Sophie posted the photo. The photo got 47 likes. The same number of likes that Connor's last post had received. The algorithm was consistent even when the people were not.

She sat on the rooftop. The city hummed below. The towers watched. The building was patient beneath her, the building that had been here since 1928, the constant in a story of variables. Different actors, same script. The people came and went and lived and died and the dying was absorbed and the living continued.

The ceiling fan in Dorm 3 turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The name waited on the bed frame. L-E-N-A.

The counter's end was empty.

The red lanterns glowed.

The building breathed.

And somewhere -- in the algorithm, in the internet, in the space between the digital and the real -- @HostelReaper was watching. @HostelReaper was always watching. The checkout was mandatory. The check-in was voluntary. And the space between the two -- the space of days and nights and meals and deliveries and warnings and silences and the slow, grinding machinery of a system that consumed the willing -- the space was the hostel, and the hostel was open, and the bed was available, and the next story was beginning.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*
