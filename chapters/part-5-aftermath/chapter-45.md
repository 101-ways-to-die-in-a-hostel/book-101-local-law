# Chapter 45: The Parents

They had never been to Asia.

David and Karen Briggs had been to Europe -- Italy, twice, for the food and the art, the trips that Australians of their generation and class took because Europe was the place you went when you could afford to go somewhere. They had been to New Zealand, which barely counted as abroad because New Zealand was the close neighbour, the cousin, the country that was different enough to be interesting and similar enough to be safe. They had been to Fiji, once, for their twenty-fifth anniversary, the resort holiday where the pool was never more than thirty metres from the room and the food was Western and the danger was sunburn.

They had never been to Asia. Asia was where Connor went. Asia was the place their son had gone four years ago and not come back from, the place that existed in his Instagram posts and his occasional phone calls and the monthly withdrawal of $2,000 from their account, the place that was simultaneously their son's home and a abstraction, a concept rather than a reality, a word rather than a world.

Now they were in it.

KLIA2 arrived around them the way airports arrived around everyone -- suddenly, totally, the transition from the sealed container of the aircraft to the open space of the terminal, the transition from the controlled atmosphere of recycled air and seat-back screens and the muted conformity of long-haul travel to the located, irreducible reality of a place. The place was Malaysia. The place was the last place their son had been alive. The place was the place where their son had died.

The terminal was large, modern, crowded. The signs were in Bahasa Melayu and English and Mandarin and Tamil, the four-language system of a country built on the confluence of civilisations. The announcements came in two languages -- Malay first, then English, the priority reflecting the constitutional hierarchy. The faces in the crowd were Malay and Chinese and Indian and European and the diversity was the diversity of a country that sat at the crossroads of trade routes and had accumulated, over centuries, the human cargo of commerce and colonialism and the modern traffic of tourism.

David carried a small backpack. The backpack was navy blue, practical, the kind of bag a property developer from Hawthorn carried when he didn't want to check luggage. The bag contained three shirts, two pairs of trousers, a toiletry bag, his passport, and a folder of documents -- the police report, the consular correspondence, the printed emails from Sarah Chen, the contact information for the lawyer they had retained in KL, the paperwork that grief had generated, the bureaucratic output of a death that had occurred in a foreign jurisdiction and required the administrative apparatus of two countries to resolve.

Karen carried a photograph.

The photograph was not in a frame. The photograph was a print -- a 6x4, glossy, the standard format of photographs from the era before phones replaced cameras. The photograph was of Connor at seventeen, in his school uniform, the Scotch College blazer and tie, standing in the front garden of the Hawthorn house with the jacaranda tree behind him. His hair was shorter than it would become, his face rounder, his expression the expression of a boy who was not yet the man who would travel to twelve countries and carry drugs in a hostel in KL and die with a towel around his neck in a cell at Dang Wangi. In the photograph, he was a boy. He was their boy.

Karen held the photograph the way she had held it for the entire flight -- in her right hand, face up, the image visible. She had not put it in her bag. She had not slipped it into the seat pocket. She had held it from Melbourne to KL, eleven hours, the photograph her companion and her evidence and her proof that the person they were flying to identify had once been a boy in a blazer in a garden and the jacaranda was blooming and the light was the golden light of a Melbourne autumn afternoon.

The flight had been AirAsia -- the budget airline, the same airline Connor had flown. They had not planned this. The flights available on short notice were limited, and the AirAsia flight was the soonest departure, and the soonest departure was the only criterion that mattered because Karen had said *today* to Sarah Chen on the phone and *today* had meant *today*, the urgency not of logistics but of biology, the maternal imperative to be near the child, to close the distance between the living mother and the dead son, the distance that was twelve thousand kilometres and was also infinite.

They passed through immigration. The officer stamped their passports. The stamps were the stamps that Malaysia issued to arriving visitors -- the red ink, the date, the permitted duration of stay. The stamps were the same stamps that Connor's passport had received forty-eight days ago. Connor's passport was now in evidence, in a plastic bag, in a locker at Dang Wangi, tagged as property of the deceased. The passport would be returned to them. The passport would travel back to Melbourne in their luggage, the document that had enabled the journey that ended the life, the administrative key that had opened the door to the country that contained the cell that contained the death.

They emerged into the arrivals hall. The heat was there, waiting, the heat that was not like Melbourne's heat -- Melbourne's heat was dry, seasonal, the heat of a temperate city that experienced summer as a visitor. KL's heat was permanent, structural, the heat of a city that existed at three degrees above the equator and did not experience seasons but only rain and the absence of rain, the heat that was not weather but climate, not a condition but an identity.

David felt the heat and the heat entered his body and he thought: *This is what he felt. When he walked out of this building forty-eight days ago, this is the air that met him. This is the heat that pressed against his skin. This is the first thing Malaysia gave him.*

Karen felt the heat and did not think about the heat. Karen was looking at the crowd beyond the barrier -- the drivers with name signs, the families waiting, the greeters and the meeters, the human infrastructure of arrival. She was looking for Sarah Chen. Sarah Chen had said she would meet them. Sarah Chen's face was not known to Karen -- they had only spoken on the phone, three times, the first time at 3 AM in the hallway, the second time the following morning when the emergency generator had been replaced by the deeper, more durable engine of purpose, the third time to confirm the flight details. Sarah Chen was a voice. Sarah Chen was about to become a face.

A woman stepped forward from the crowd. She was in her thirties, professional, the grey blazer and white blouse of a consular officer at work. She held a small sign: BRIGGS.

"Mr. and Mrs. Briggs. I'm Sarah Chen. We spoke on the phone."

The voice was the voice. The voice that had entered the Hawthorn house at 3 AM and changed the shape of the world. The voice was now attached to a person, a face, a body, a woman standing in an arrivals hall holding a sign with their name on it, the name that was also their son's name, the name that had been in newspapers and police reports and consular correspondence and would be in more newspapers soon.

David shook her hand. Karen did not -- Karen's right hand held the photograph and Karen's left hand held David's arm and the holding of both was the holding of the two things she could not let go: the image of her son and the body of her husband, the evidence of the past and the anchor of the present.

"Thank you for coming," Sarah Chen said. "I know this is --"

"Where is he?" Karen said.

The question was direct, unmodified, the question of a mother who had travelled twelve thousand kilometres and eleven hours and had not slept and had not eaten and had held a photograph for the duration and wanted only the answer to the question that had been forming since the phone rang at 3 AM: *where is my son?*

"The hospital. The forensic mortuary at Hospital Kuala Lumpur. I'll take you there now, if you're ready."

"We're ready," David said. He said it because Karen was already moving, already walking toward the exit, already crossing the arrivals hall with the purpose of a woman for whom ready was not a state to be achieved but a condition that had existed since the moment she learned her son was dead, the readiness to see him, to be near him, to touch him one more time, the readiness that was not courage but compulsion, the need that was stronger than fear and older than reason.

---

Hospital Kuala Lumpur was a complex of buildings on Jalan Pahang, the public hospital, the government hospital, the hospital where the people of KL were born and treated and died. The forensic mortuary was in a separate wing, a low building at the edge of the complex, the architecture functional, the purpose singular.

Sarah Chen drove them. The car was the High Commission vehicle -- a Toyota sedan, air-conditioned, clean. The drive from KLIA2 took an hour. During the hour, Sarah Chen explained the process. The explanation was delivered in the measured, rehearsed language of a person who had done this before -- not with the Briggs specifically but with other families, other parents, other people who had flown to Malaysia to identify the body of someone they loved.

"The identification is a formal process," she said. "You'll be taken to a viewing room. The body will be on a table, covered by a sheet. The attendant will fold the sheet back from the face. You'll be asked to confirm the identity. You can take as long as you need."

David nodded. He was in the front passenger seat. He watched the city through the windscreen -- the highway, the buildings, the traffic, the palm trees, the construction cranes, the billboards in three languages. The city was modern and sprawling and unfamiliar and every part of it was the last place his son had been and every building might have been a building Connor had walked past and every street might have been a street Connor had walked on and the *might have been* was the particular torment of a parent in a dead child's city, the inability to know which surfaces had held the child's footprints, which air had held the child's breath, which lights had been the last lights the child had seen.

Karen was in the back seat. She held the photograph. She had not spoken since the question in the arrivals hall. The not-speaking was not silence -- the not-speaking was the concentration of a mind engaged in a single task, the task of getting to the place where her son was, the task that required the conservation of every resource, every word, every breath, for the moment when she would see him.

The mortuary entrance was a door. Not a grand entrance, not an architectural statement, but a door -- grey, metal, institutional, the door that separated the living from the dead and the dead from the living, the door that families walked through once and carried the walking through for the rest of their lives.

A mortuary attendant met them. He was a Malay man in his fifties, quiet, experienced, gentle in the way that mortuary workers became gentle over years of dealing with grief in its most concentrated form. He spoke to Sarah Chen in Bahasa Melayu. Sarah Chen translated.

"He'll take you to the viewing room. He asks if you need a moment."

"No," Karen said. The word was the same word she had said on the phone: *today*. The word was the word of a woman who understood that moments of preparation were moments of delay and delay was the thing she could not tolerate, the thing that stood between her and her son.

The corridor was long. The floor was linoleum. The walls were pale green. The lighting was fluorescent -- the same fluorescent that lit every institutional space in this country, the same fluorescent that had lit the cell where Connor died, the universal light of systems that processed humans without regard for the humans' preference for warmth.

The viewing room was at the end of the corridor. The room was small. The room contained a table, a steel table, the kind of table that existed only in places where bodies were placed on tables -- hospitals, morgues, the rooms where the living came to see the dead. The table was covered by a white sheet. Under the white sheet was a shape.

The shape was a body. The body was their son.

Karen entered the room first. David followed. Sarah Chen waited at the door. The attendant stood by the table.

The attendant looked at Karen. Karen nodded.

The attendant folded the sheet back from the face.

The face was Connor's face.

The face was Connor's face and was not Connor's face. The face she had known for twenty-seven years -- the delivery room at the Royal Women's Hospital, the face red and creased and crying and the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. The face that had grown and changed and become a boy and a teenager and a man, and was now in repose, but the repose was not sleep, was the permanent stillness that death imposed on the muscles that had animated the face and made it Connor's rather than a face.

The tan was fading. Four years of equatorial sun retreating, the skin returning to the colour he had been born with, the colour of a baby in Parkville, the first colour, underneath the years.

His hair was the same. Dirty blonde, sun-bleached. The hair she had washed when he was a child.

Karen touched his hair.

Her hand moved from her side to his head and the movement was the movement of twenty-seven years of touching, the hand that had smoothed this hair when it was wet from the bath and when it was tangled after sleep and when it was sweaty after sport and when it was hidden under a hat. The hand knew this hair. The hand recognised this hair the way it recognised nothing else in the room -- not the table, not the walls, not the sheet, not the country -- the hand found the hair and the finding was the last recognition, the last physical confirmation that the body on the table was the body she had made, the body she had grown inside her and delivered and held and bathed and clothed and fed and loved and watched walk through a departure gate four years ago and not come back.

David's hand was on her shoulder.

The hand was on her shoulder the way it had been on Connor's shoulder at the airport, four years ago, the day Connor had left. The same position. The same weight. The same five fingers resting on the same place -- the bone, the muscle, the fabric of a shirt. At the airport, the hand on Connor's shoulder had been the hand of a father saying goodbye to a son. Now, the hand on Karen's shoulder was the hand of a husband holding a wife while she touched their dead son's hair. The hand was the same hand. The position was the same position. The weight was the same weight. But the meaning had changed because the person under the hand had changed and the person on the table had changed everything, the death changing not just the dead but the living, not just the body but the bodies around it, the death radiating outward from the table through the room through the building through the city through the sky to a house in Hawthorn where a photograph sat on a table in a hallway and the photograph was all that remained of the original configuration, the configuration of a family with two children both alive.

Karen's hand stayed on Connor's hair. David's hand stayed on Karen's shoulder. The three of them -- the living couple and the dead son -- held the position in the viewing room of the forensic mortuary at Hospital Kuala Lumpur and the holding was the last time the three of them would be together, the last time the family would occupy the same space, the geometry of three bodies in a room and one of the bodies was still and the stillness was the condition that made this the last time and the last time was a thing that could not be known as the last time until it was over and then it was always the last time, retroactively, permanently.

"That's Connor," David said.

The words were the formal identification. The words were required by the process -- a family member confirming the identity of the deceased, the legal act that converted a body from anonymous remains to a named person with a citizenship and a family and a history and a file. The words were procedural. The words were also the last time David would say his son's name and have his son be present to hear it, even though the hearing was impossible, even though the dead did not hear, even though the words travelled from David's mouth to the air and the air held them and the air was the air of a room where hearing had ended.

"That's our boy," Karen said.

The attendant waited. Sarah Chen waited. The room waited. The building waited. The city outside the building waited, the traffic and the heat and the eight million lives continuing while in this room, in this building, in this city, two parents from Melbourne stood over the body of their twenty-seven-year-old son and the standing was the thing they had flown twelve thousand kilometres to do and the thing they would never be ready for and the thing that was happening now, in this moment, in this room, under this light.

---

The hostel was a ten-minute walk from the LRT station. Sarah Chen offered to drive them but Karen said no. Karen wanted to walk. Karen wanted to walk through the streets that Connor had walked through, to feel the pavement under her feet that had been under his feet, to breathe the air that had been his air. The walking was not sightseeing. The walking was pilgrimage, the movement of a body through a landscape that was sacred not because of what it contained but because of who had moved through it before.

They walked down Petaling Street. The market was active -- the stalls, the vendors, the shoppers, the permanent commerce of a street that had been trading since the tin-mining days of the nineteenth century. The noise was the noise that Connor had loved, the chaos that he had filmed and posted and captioned with hashtags. The smells were the smells he had smelled -- the char kway teow frying, the diesel exhaust, the incense from the Guan Di Temple. The colours were the colours he had seen -- the red of Chinese signage, the gold of temple decorations, the green of tropical plants growing from cracks in old buildings.

David walked beside Karen. He was quiet. He had been quiet since the mortuary. The quietness was not the silence of a man with nothing to say but the silence of a man whose capacity for speech had been temporarily exhausted, the reservoir drained by the two sentences he had spoken in the viewing room -- *That's Connor* -- the sentences that had required the last of his available language, the last of the energy that the emergency system provided.

They reached the hostel. The narrow door. The red lantern. The facade that looked like what it was -- an old building in a Chinatown that had been many things and was now a hostel and would be something else after the hostel, the building cycling through identities the way beds cycled through occupants.

They entered. The bell rang. Mei Ling looked up.

"Mr. and Mrs. Briggs."

The words were spoken with the care of a receptionist who had been told to expect them, who had been briefed by Razak, who had prepared the common room and asked Mama Siti to cook and who now stood behind the wooden counter and said their name and the name was the name of their dead son and the name was the last thing they wanted to hear and the first thing they needed to hear because the hearing confirmed that they were in the right place, the place where their son had lived, the place where the name was known.

Mei Ling led them upstairs. The staircase was narrow -- too narrow for two people to pass, the staircase that Connor had climbed every day, the staircase where the third step from the top squeaked. Karen stepped on the third step. The squeak was a small sound. The small sound was enormous. The small sound was the sound of a piece of the building responding to weight, the same piece that had responded to Connor's weight, the wood flexing under her foot the way it had flexed under his, the building's memory stored not in consciousness but in physics, in the compression and decompression of timber that had been walked on by a thousand bodies and would be walked on by a thousand more.

Dorm 3. The door was open. The room was the same room Priya had stood in the day before -- the eight bunks, the ceiling fan, the air well light, the smell of damp wood and Tiger Balm.

Bed 7. Lower bunk, right side, second from the back.

The French girl was out. The bed was made -- the white hostel sheet pulled tight, the pillow straight, the bed the bed of an occupant who was tidy, who folded her sheets in the morning, who would return in the evening and sleep and wake and leave and the bed would hold another body and the cycle would continue.

David walked to the bed. His hand found the bed frame. The wood was dark, smooth, worn by the oil of hands and the humidity of years. His fingers moved along the rail. His fingers found a groove. The groove was a letter. The letter was L. His fingers moved. E. N. A.

LENA.

He didn't know what the letters meant. He didn't know they were a name. He didn't know the name belonged to a twenty-two-year-old Swedish woman who had slept in this bed and been recruited by Felix and arrested carrying drugs to Thailand and was now in Kajang Prison awaiting trial. He didn't know that the letters were the previous occupant's mark, the same kind of mark that prisoners carved in walls and lovers carved in trees, the human compulsion to leave evidence of having been, to say *I was here* in a medium more durable than memory.

He thought the letters were damage. Just wear. Just the marks that buildings accumulated -- the scratches and dents and grooves of daily use, the entropy that age imposed on surfaces, the evidence of nothing in particular, the random record of a building's passage through time.

His hand rested on the letters. His hand held the bed frame the way it had held the phone in the hallway at 3 AM, the way it had held Karen's shoulder in the mortuary, the way it had held Connor's shoulder at the airport. The hand was the same hand. The hand was always the same hand. But the things it held kept changing, and the changes were the changes that the death had made, the death converting every object from a thing into a relic, every surface from a surface into a site, every touch from a gesture into a memorial.

Karen stood behind David. She looked at the bed. She did not touch it. She looked at the pillow and thought about her son's head on the pillow and the thought was the thought of a mother imagining the physical space her child had occupied and the imagining was the only way she could be with him now, the imagination the only bridge across the gap that death had opened, the gap between the mother and the child, the gap that was the width of a mortuary table and the depth of the earth and the distance of the twelve thousand kilometres and the immeasurable, uncrossable distance of death itself.

"This is where he slept," she said.

"This is where he slept."

David's repetition was confirmation. The repetition was the married couple's grammar -- the statement and the echo, the call and the response, the shared language that thirty-one years of marriage had developed, the language that was not just words but the pattern of words, the rhythm of speech that two people created when they had been speaking to each other long enough that the speaking was not communication but communion.

Mama Siti was in the kitchen.

She was always in the kitchen. The kitchen was her domain -- the stove, the rice cooker, the spice rack, the chopping board, the space that she had occupied since before the building was a hostel, the space where she performed the daily miracle of converting raw ingredients into the food that brought people back and held them and nourished them and was the only magic the building possessed that was not dark.

She had prepared nasi lemak. The nasi lemak was on two plates on the kitchen table -- the coconut rice, the sambal, the fried anchovies, the roasted peanuts, the hard-boiled egg, the cucumber slices. The arrangement was precise, the arrangement of a woman who cooked not just with skill but with intention, each element placed with the care that the food deserved and the eaters needed.

David and Karen sat at the table. They sat because Mama Siti gestured for them to sit, the gesture simple and commanding, the gesture of a woman who had been feeding people for longer than anyone could remember and whose authority in the kitchen was absolute.

Karen looked at the food. The food was unfamiliar -- the coconut rice, the sambal red and fragrant, the anchovies tiny and crisp. She had never eaten nasi lemak. She had never been to Malaysia. The food was the food of a country she had come to because her son had died in it, and the food was the first tangible thing the country offered her that was not grief or bureaucracy or the fluorescent-lit corridors of institutions.

She ate.

The food was good. The food was more than good -- the rice was rich and creamy, the sambal was hot and sweet and complex, the anchovies were salty and crunchy and the combination of all of it was the taste of a cuisine that had been developed over centuries by people who understood that food was not fuel but language, that a meal was not nourishment but communication, that the plate was a letter and the flavours were the words and the message was: *you are here, you are fed, you are held*.

Karen ate and the eating was the first normal thing she had done since the phone rang at 3 AM. The eating was the body's insistence on the body's needs, the body overriding the mind's objection that food was irrelevant when your child was dead, the body saying: *you are alive, and the alive must eat, and the eating is not betrayal but survival, and survival is the thing you have to do now because the alternative is the thing that happened to your son and you cannot follow him there, not yet, not this way*.

The food was the last thing Connor ate.

Karen didn't know this. Mama Siti did.

Mama Siti knew because Mama Siti had served Connor his last nasi lemak on the morning of Day 47, the morning he had come downstairs at six thirty with the look of a man who was about to do the thing he had been dreading and the dread was visible and the visibility was the thing that Mama Siti had seen and understood and filed in the place where she filed the things she knew about the people who passed through her kitchen, the knowledge that was not recorded and not spoken and not shared but was held, in the body, in the hands, in the memory of a woman who had been in this kitchen since before the hostel and would be in this kitchen after it.

Mama Siti watched Karen eat. She watched the way Karen held the fork -- tentatively, the grip of a person eating unfamiliar food in an unfamiliar place. She watched the way Karen chewed -- slowly, carefully, the chewing of a person who was tasting something for the first time and the first time was also the first time she had tasted what her son had tasted and the tasting was a kind of connection, the flavours a bridge between the living mother and the dead son, the sambal the shared experience that they could not have shared when he was alive because he was here and she was there and the distance was the distance of a family separated by a son's restlessness and a mother's inability to follow.

Mama Siti watched Karen eat and said nothing. The nothing was not silence. The nothing was restraint, the decision not to tell the mother that the food she was eating was the food her son had eaten on the morning he died, the decision that the information was a weight the mother did not need, a fact that would convert the meal from nourishment into archaeology, from food into evidence, from the taste of Malaysia into the taste of the last morning.

David ate too. He ate mechanically, the eating of a man who was performing a function rather than experiencing a pleasure, the fork-to-mouth rhythm of a body fuelling itself while the mind occupied a different room, a different country, a different time -- the time before the phone call, the time when Connor was alive and the monthly deposit was a worry but not a grief and the house in Hawthorn was a home and not a monument to a family that no longer existed in its original form.

Mama Siti sat across from them. She did not eat. She watched. Her face was the face of a woman who had watched many things -- the building's transformations, the occupants' arrivals and departures, the cycle of beds filled and emptied, the rhythm of a place that consumed people and was consumed by them. Her face was old. The age was not a number but a quality -- the quality of a face that had absorbed time rather than merely passed through it, the face that was a repository of the building's history, the face that knew.

She spoke. She spoke in English, her English careful, accented, the English of a woman who had learned the language not in school but in a kitchen, from the guests who passed through, the words accumulated over years the way the building accumulated marks.

"Your son," she said. "He was kind. He did not know he was kind, but he was. He sat in this kitchen. He tried to cook sambal. He burned his hand." She held up her own hand, showing the gesture. "He laughed. Always laughing. Even when he should not have been laughing. Even when the laughing was the thing that kept him from seeing."

Karen looked at Mama Siti. Karen's eyes were the eyes of a mother hearing someone describe her son, the particular pain and gratitude of hearing the dead described by someone who had known them in a place the mother had never been, the testimony of a stranger who was not a stranger because the stranger had fed her son and watched her son and known her son in the specific, daily, intimate way that the people who shared a kitchen knew each other.

"He ate here every morning," Mama Siti said. "Every morning, he came down the stairs and he said *Morning, Mama Siti* and I gave him nasi lemak and he ate and he said *legend* and the word meant thank you."

Karen's hand was on the table. Mama Siti's hand crossed the table and covered it. The two hands -- the Australian mother's hand and the Malaysian cook's hand, the hand that had held a photograph for eleven hours and the hand that had held a ladle for decades, the hand of grief and the hand of knowledge -- the two hands held each other across the kitchen table and the holding was the bridge between two women who had loved the same person in different ways and lost the same person in different ways and were now connected by the loss the way two shores were connected by the water between them, the water that was the grief that flowed between them and touched them both.

"Thank you for feeding him," Karen said.

Mama Siti's eyes were bright. The brightness was not tears -- Mama Siti did not cry, or if she did, she did not cry in kitchens, in front of guests, in the space where her authority was absolute. The brightness was the thing that preceded tears and sometimes replaced them, the internal pressure of a feeling too large for the vessel that held it.

"He is fed," Mama Siti said. The tense was ambiguous -- the present tense that could have been a statement about the past or a statement about a different present, the tense that Mama Siti used when she spoke about the dead, the tense that did not distinguish between the living and the gone because in Mama Siti's understanding, in the understanding that the building had taught her, the gone were not absent but relocated, not ended but elsewhere, and the elsewhere was a place where the kitchen reached and the food reached and the feeding continued.

---

Priya was in the common room.

She had been waiting. She had been waiting since she heard from Sarah Chen that the parents were coming to the hostel, since she had understood that the meeting she had been dreading and needing was going to happen, since she had sat on the edge of her bed in Private Room 2 and looked at the jade bracelet on her wrist and thought about what she would say to the mother of the man who had given it to her.

She had not prepared words. She had tried -- in the hours of waiting, she had composed sentences, discarded them, composed new ones, discarded those. The sentences were always wrong. The sentences were either too much or too little, too clinical or too emotional, too explanatory or too simple. The sentences failed because sentences were insufficient for the thing that the meeting required, the thing that lived beyond language, in the space where two kinds of love met and the meeting was not competition but communion, the mother's love and the girlfriend's love standing in the same room and the room holding both and the holding being the closest thing to enough that the situation allowed.

David and Karen came from the kitchen. Their faces carried the remains of the meal and the conversation with Mama Siti. David's face was composed -- the composure of a man who had decided that composure was the contribution he could make, the structural support that the situation required, the wall that held while the interior was in ruins. Karen's face was open -- the openness of a woman who had stopped trying to contain the thing that could not be contained, the grief that would not be managed or scheduled or limited to appropriate moments but would arrive when it arrived and express itself as it needed to express itself.

Karen saw Priya.

She knew. She knew the way mothers knew -- not from introduction or explanation but from the look, the posture, the quality of the grief on the young woman's face. The young woman sitting on the common room sofa with the battered Lonely Planet guide on the table and the jade bracelet on her wrist and the expression that was the expression of a person who had lost the person that the mother had lost and the loss was written on the face the way grief was always written on faces, the handwriting of the heart visible on the skin.

"You're Priya," Karen said.

"Yes."

Karen crossed the common room and sat beside Priya. She saw the glasses, the braid, the practical clothes, the jade bracelet.

"He bought that for me," Priya said. "At the night market. On Petaling Street. He saw me looking at it and he bought it. He said it was the same green as my eyes, which was wrong -- my eyes are brown. But he said it with such confidence that I didn't correct him. That was Connor. He was always confident about things he was wrong about."

Karen laughed. The laugh was the first sound she had made since the mortuary that was not grief -- the sound was the sound of recognition, the sound of hearing her son described in a way that she recognised, the precise, vivid description of a trait that she had known for twenty-seven years. The confidence about wrong things. The absolute, unshakeable certainty about matters he had not investigated. The charm that made the wrongness endearing rather than infuriating. She knew this. She had raised this.

The laugh became something else. The laugh became the sound that existed next to laughter, the sound that was laughter's neighbour, the sound that used the same muscles and the same breath but produced a different output. The sound was the sound of the mortuary. The sound was the sound of the hallway at 3 AM. The sound was the sound that had no name because naming it would have required the clinical distance that the sound made impossible.

Karen held Priya. The holding was sudden -- Karen's arms around Priya's shoulders, the embrace of a woman who had crossed a room and sat down and heard a story about a bracelet and laughed and then could not stop the other thing from coming, the thing that the laugh had opened the door to, the way a crack in a dam opened the door to the water.

Priya was held. Priya held back. The two women held each other on the sofa in the common room of the Lantern Hostel, the sofa where Connor had sat for six weeks, the sofa where Priya had kissed him and argued with him and said goodbye to him, the sofa that was the last piece of furniture in the building that held the shape of his body and the warmth of his presence and the echo of his voice saying *she'll be right, babe* in the way that meant nothing and everything.

They cried. The crying was not performative and was not restrained and was not the crying of a scene in a film where the tears were lit and the music swelled and the audience was moved by the beauty of the grief. The crying was the ugly, bodily, uncontrollable crying of two women who had lost the same man and who were now in the same room and the room was the room where he had been alive and the being-alive was what they were crying for, not the death but the life, not the loss but the having-had, the brief, insufficient, irreplaceable time when Connor Briggs was a person in this room and the room held him and they held him and the holding was the thing that was over.

David stood in the kitchen doorway. He watched his wife hold a woman he had never met and understood that the grief in this room was not his to enter -- mother and girlfriend, the knowledge of the beginning and the knowledge of the end.

Mama Siti appeared beside him. Hands folded in front of her apron. Eyes on the two women on the sofa.

"The same," she said softly. "Always the same."

The jade bracelet caught the light.

The ceiling fans turned.

Outside, on Petaling Street, the market continued its ancient commerce, and the vendors called their prices, and the incense rose from the temple, and the city breathed, and the breathing was the breathing of a place that held the living and the dead equally, without preference, without judgement, the breathing of a city that had been breathing for a hundred and fifty years and would breathe for a hundred and fifty more, the breathing that was the only permanence in a world of impermanence, the only constant in a world of change, the only thing that remained when everything else -- the people, the buildings, the names carved in bed frames, the blue towels, the jade bracelets, the nasi lemak, the love, the grief, the laughter, the crying -- when all of it was gone.

The parents had come.
