# Chapter 22: Priya vs Felix

Priya waited in the common room until eleven forty-seven PM, and when Connor came down from the rooftop his face told her everything his mouth would not.

She had been sitting in the armchair -- her armchair, the one with the sunken left cushion and the coffee stain shaped like Madagascar that someone had tried to cover with a throw pillow. She had been reading the same paragraph of her Lonely Planet for forty minutes, the words refusing to resolve into meaning, because meaning was upstairs on the rooftop where a German man was doing something to the Australian man she loved, and the doing was not physical but the damage would be.

She had been timing him. Five minutes, he'd said. Five minutes and then he'd call Ahmad. She had given him five, then ten, then twenty, then the twenty became thirty and the thirty became an hour and the hour was the shape of a lie -- not a malicious lie, not even a conscious lie, but the structural lie of a person who had said *five minutes* because saying it made the going possible and the going was what the machine required.

At eleven forty-seven, the staircase creaked -- the third step, the one that always announced arrivals like a sentry that had been bribed but still showed up for work. Connor descended into the amber light of the common room and Priya looked up from Madagascar and saw his face and the face was a ruin.

Not a dramatic ruin. Not tears, not rage, not the cinematic collapse of a man receiving terrible news. The ruin was subtler and therefore worse -- a draining, a vacancy, an emptiness -- the usual expressions evacuated, the surface technically still a face but no longer quite animated by the person behind it. His eyes were open but unfocused. His mouth was slightly ajar, the lower lip slack. His skin, bronzed by five weeks of tropical sun, had acquired a greyish undertone, the skin of a man whose blood had redirected itself inward, away from the surface, toward the organs that required it most.

He looked at Priya. She looked at him. The common room was empty except for the two of them and the gecko that lived behind the TV, whose intermittent clicking was the building's smallest heartbeat.

"What happened?" she said.

Connor shook his head. The headshake was minimal, economical, the gesture of a man conserving energy because energy had become finite. He walked past her armchair, past the coffee table with its abandoned magazines and someone's half-finished crossword, toward the staircase that led to the dorms.

"Connor."

He stopped. He didn't turn.

"It's bad," he said. His voice was flat. Not the breezy Australian flatness that was his default register, the she'll-be-right flatness that treated the world as a minor inconvenience. This was a different flatness -- the flatness of a man who had been emptied and was reporting from inside the empty.

He went upstairs. Priya heard his footsteps on the second-floor landing, the creak of the dorm door, the rustle of a man climbing into a bunk and pulling a thin sheet over himself like a membrane between his body and the world.

She sat in the armchair. She looked at the staircase. She looked at the ceiling, which was the floor of the dorm, which was the underside of the bunk where Connor was lying in the dark with whatever Felix had told him.

And then Priya Sharma made a decision.

The decision was not impulsive. Priya did not make impulsive decisions -- she was a fourth-year medical student at King's College London, trained to assess, diagnose, and act in sequence, trained to trust the evidence rather than the emotion, trained to cut when cutting was required and wait when waiting was better. The decision she made at 11:53 PM in the common room of the Lantern Hostel was a diagnostic decision: the patient was deteriorating, the current treatment (warnings, evidence, appeals) had failed, and the next step was to address the pathogen directly.

Felix was the pathogen. Felix was on the third floor. Priya was going to the third floor.

She stood. She straightened her glasses -- the round frames, the nervous gesture, the small act of preparation that preceded every difficult thing she'd ever done, from anatomy practicals to her brother's A-level results night to the night she'd told her mother she was traveling alone through Southeast Asia and her mother had looked at her with an expression that combined pride and terror in equal measure and said *beta, please be careful with your heart*.

The staircase was narrow. She climbed it in the dark, one hand on the wall, the wood cool and slightly damp beneath her fingers. The hostel at midnight was a different building from the hostel at noon -- the red lanterns were dimmer, their glow reduced to a low throb, and the air well funnelled the sounds of the city upward in a column of distant traffic and the occasional motorcycle and, beneath everything, the deep hum of a tropical night -- not silence at all but insects and ventilation and the breathing of thirty-odd people asleep in their bunks.

She passed the second floor. Dorm 3's door was closed. Connor was in there, in Bed 7, under the sheet, with Lena's name scratched into the frame he'd never read.

Third floor. The corridor was shorter up here -- two dorms, two private rooms, one bathroom. The bathroom light was on, leaking under the door, the perpetual fluorescent vigil that bathrooms in hostels maintained regardless of occupancy, as though the light itself was waiting for someone who would never arrive. Dorm 4 was quiet. Dorm 5 was quiet. Tomoko was in there somewhere, sleeping with the disciplined efficiency of a woman who had trained herself to rest in difficult places.

Private Room 1. Felix's door.

The door was wood, painted cream, the paint cracking in the humidity. A small brass number -- 1 -- was screwed to it at eye level, the screw slightly loose, the number tilted fifteen degrees clockwise, giving the impression of an address that had given up on precision. No light showed beneath the door. No sound came from within.

Priya knocked.

The knock was three sharp raps -- the clinical knock, the doctor's knock, the knock that says *I am here with purpose and the purpose does not require your permission*. She had learned this knock in her third year, on the wards, where hesitation was interpreted as incompetence and softness was interpreted as uncertainty, and where the patients who needed you most were the patients least likely to invite you in.

Silence. Then movement -- the creak of a bed frame, the soft pad of bare feet on tile, the particular rustle of a man who had been awake despite the darkness, who had been lying in bed in the dark the way predators lie in the dark, not sleeping but processing, calibrating, preparing for what came next.

The door opened.

Felix stood in the doorway. He was wearing a white linen shirt, unbuttoned, over dark cotton trousers. His feet were bare. His close-cropped hair was undisturbed -- the hair of a man who had not been sleeping, who had been lying on his back with his hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling, running calculations. The scar on his left eyebrow caught the bathroom's fluorescent bleed from down the corridor.

"Priya." He said her name the way he always said names -- precisely, with the slight emphasis on the first syllable that made the naming feel like a gift, an acknowledgement, as though the mere fact of being called by Felix Decker was a privilege the called should appreciate. "It's late."

"I need to talk to you."

He studied her. The study was brief -- two seconds, three -- but thorough, the way a diagnostician studies a patient (she recognised it, she did it herself), cataloguing the physical data: her posture (rigid, shoulders back, the stance of confrontation), her breathing (controlled, deliberate, the breathing of someone managing their adrenaline), her hands (at her sides, not clenched, not trembling, steady -- and this, she knew, would interest him most, because steady hands meant resolve, and resolve in a visitor at midnight was a more complex variable than fear).

"Come in," he said. He stepped aside. The invitation was delivered without hesitation, which was itself a kind of threat -- the ease of a man who feared nothing from the person at his door, the casual openness of someone who controlled the room regardless of who occupied it.

Priya entered.

Private Room 1 was small -- three metres by four, the dimensions of a generous cell or a modest bedroom, depending on your frame of reference. A single bed against the wall, neatly made, the sheet pulled taut with military precision. A wooden desk, empty except for a leather toiletry bag and a paperback -- Goethe, in German, the spine cracked at the midpoint. A window facing the air well, shutters open, the warm night air moving through the room in a slow, humid current. No decorations. No photographs. No evidence of personality. The room was occupied but not inhabited, the room of a man who kept his identity in his pocket rather than on his walls.

And on the desk, beside the Goethe, a small electric kettle and two ceramic cups.

"Tea?" Felix said. He was already filling the kettle from a bottle of water. "I have chamomile and green. The chamomile is quite good -- I brought it from Hamburg."

The offer was perfect. That was the horror of it. A woman had come to his room at midnight with confrontation in her posture and accusation in her eyes, and Felix Decker's first response was to offer her tea with the warm efficiency of a host who had been expecting this visit and had prepared for it the way he prepared for everything -- calmly, completely, with all the tools arranged in advance.

"I don't want tea."

"You might. These conversations are better with tea." He plugged the kettle in. It began to hum. "Please, sit." He gestured to the single chair, a wooden chair with a woven rattan seat that belonged to the desk. He sat on the edge of the bed, cross-legged, his bare feet folded beneath him, the posture of a man settling in for a conversation he expected to win.

Priya did not sit. She stood between the door and the desk, equidistant from each, the positioning instinctive -- a clinical placement, exit accessible, body angled to allow retreat. She had learned spatial awareness in her A&E rotation, where patients sometimes became threats and the distance between you and the door was the distance between safety and harm.

"What did you tell Connor?"

Felix smiled. The smile was small, controlled, the calibrated expression of a man who had many smiles and selected them the way a surgeon selects instruments -- each one designed for a specific incision. This smile said: *I appreciate the directness. I will now match it.*

"I told him the truth. Which is more than most people in his life have done."

"The truth about what?"

"About his situation. His options. His future. The things that a friend tells a friend when the friend is in difficulty."

"You're not his friend."

"By what standard?" The kettle was beginning to heat. A faint steam rose from the spout, vapour in the humid air, barely visible. "I gave him employment when he was broke. I gave him structure when he had none. I gave him a sense of purpose in a life that was, frankly, purposeless. I've done more for Connor in five weeks than his parents did in twenty-seven years. Friendship is defined by action, Priya, not by sentiment."

The words were smooth, rehearsed, the verbal equivalent of Felix's linen shirt -- well-constructed, appropriate, concealing whatever was underneath. Priya recognised the technique. She had seen it in consultants on the wards, the senior doctors who could describe a terminal diagnosis in language so measured and well-crafted that the patient walked away feeling cared for rather than doomed. The technique was called *framing*. Felix was framing exploitation as friendship, the way a gilded frame turned a mediocre painting into something that looked like art.

"You gave him packages to carry," Priya said. "You gave him jobs that put him in contact with your suppliers and your buyers. You gave him a phone that tracks every instruction. You put his fingerprints on methamphetamine and his face on CCTV and now you've told him the truth, not because you care about the truth but because the truth is a weapon and you needed him to understand the size of the weapon you're holding."

She said this without raising her voice. The words were precise, clinical, delivered with the economy of a diagnosis -- each sentence a finding, the cumulative effect a picture that left no room for the patient's preferred narrative. She had been assembling this diagnosis for weeks, since the first afternoon she'd seen Connor carrying a package with the breezy, unbothered gait of a man who didn't know what he was holding. She had assembled it the way she assembled all diagnoses -- observation, pattern recognition, differential analysis, and the slow, grinding elimination of alternative explanations until only one remained.

Felix listened. He listened the way he did everything -- with full attention, his body still, his eyes on hers, the focus of a man who processed information professionally and was now processing Priya's words the way he processed market data, supply routes, risk assessments. He did not interrupt. He did not bristle. He did not perform offence. He listened, and the listening was the most frightening thing about him, because it meant he was not threatened.

The kettle clicked off. The water was boiled.

"Chamomile, then," he said. He stood, unfolded, moved to the desk with the unhurried precision of a man performing a ritual. He placed a teabag in each cup. He poured the water. The scent of chamomile rose into the room -- warm, floral, the scent of something designed to soothe, the olfactory equivalent of a lullaby, deployed in a room where no one should have felt soothed and where the deploying was itself an act of control.

He held a cup out to Priya. She did not take it. He set it on the desk beside her, the gesture carrying the message: *It's here when you want it. I am patient. I can wait.*

"You're a medical student," Felix said. He sat back on the bed. The chamomile steamed between his hands. "Fourth year. King's College London. Your father is a cardiologist at St Thomas'. Your mother runs a GP practice in Wembley. You have a younger brother, Arjun, who is applying to read law at UCL. Your visa status in Malaysia is a tourist visa, thirty days, currently on day nineteen, eleven days remaining. You are, in every measurable way, a person with something to lose."

He said this without threat. That was the craft -- the information was delivered the way a newscaster delivered facts, with the calm, neutral affect of someone reporting rather than warning. The threat was in the information itself, not in the delivery. The threat was in the specificity: he knew her father's hospital, her brother's name, her visa's expiry date. He had compiled a file. He had compiled a file the way he compiled files on everyone -- not because he planned to use it but because having it ensured he could.

Priya's hands stayed at her sides. Her pulse was elevated -- she could feel it in her wrists, in the radial artery, the accelerated rhythm of a sympathetic nervous system engaging its fight-or-flight cascade. Adrenaline. Norepinephrine. Cortisol. She catalogued the physiological response with the detachment of a clinician observing a stress reaction, and the cataloguing helped, because naming the chemicals gave her a framework and the framework gave her distance and the distance was what she needed to keep her voice level.

"Are you threatening me?"

"I'm providing context." Felix sipped his tea. "You want to help Connor. That's admirable. I understand it. But help is a complicated thing, Priya, and the help you're imagining -- going to the police, contacting the embassy, pulling Connor out of this -- would have consequences you haven't fully considered."

"Consequences for whom?"

"For everyone. For Connor, obviously -- the evidence exists, the CCTV footage, the fingerprints, the bank records. If the police become involved, the evidence becomes their evidence. I can't control what happens to it then. Connor would be charged. Trafficking. Mandatory penalty."

"Connor could cooperate. Provide testimony. Identify you."

"He could try." Felix's voice didn't change. It maintained its register -- the soft German-accented English, the measured cadence, the voice of reason deployed in the service of something unreasonable. "But testimony requires evidence that implicates someone other than the testifier. My name isn't in his phone. My fingerprints aren't on the packages. I don't appear on the CCTV footage in any compromising way. I'm a backpacker who stayed at the same hostel. The prosecution would have Connor -- on camera, carrying drugs, fingerprints confirmed -- and they would have his claim that a German photographer told him to do it. How do you think that plays in a Malaysian courtroom?"

He paused. The pause was theatrical, the pause of a man who had delivered this speech before or had rehearsed it so thoroughly that the delivery and the rehearsal were indistinguishable. He drank his tea. The chamomile scent thickened in the small room, mixing with the humid air from the open shutters and the faint, distant smell of Petaling Street's night-food vendors -- satay smoke and hot oil and the sweetish ferment of an open drain.

"Now consider the consequences for you," Felix continued. "You're a witness. If you go to the police, you become part of the investigation. Your visa status, your travel history, your relationship with Connor -- all scrutinised. Your medical career requires a clean criminal record, doesn't it? A DBS check? How does 'questioned in connection with a drug trafficking investigation in Malaysia' appear on a DBS check? I genuinely don't know the answer. But I imagine your father might."

The room was quiet except for the air well's ambient sounds -- the distant hum of the city, a motorcycle accelerating on Jalan Sultan, the click of the gecko from somewhere below, and now, arriving with the sudden shift in air pressure that Kuala Lumpur announced its storms with, the first low rumble of thunder.

Priya felt the air change. The humidity, already oppressive, thickened further, the way air thickened before a tropical downpour -- the molecules compressing, the barometric pressure dropping, the atmosphere becoming a physical substance you could almost grip. Through the shutters, the sky over the Petronas Towers had darkened from its usual night-glow amber to something deeper, bruised, the colour of old blood behind glass.

"You've thought about this," she said.

"I think about everything. It's my job."

"Your job is drug trafficking."

"My job is logistics. The product is incidental." He said this without irony, or with an irony so deep it had looped back around to sincerity, the irony of a man who had told himself a story about his own profession and believed it the way Connor believed his story about phone accessories -- not because the evidence supported it but because the alternative was a mirror he didn't want to face.

The thunder came again, closer. The room's shutters trembled. And then the rain began.

KL rain was not like London rain. Priya had grown up with London rain -- the grey, persistent drizzle, the rain that was more mood than event, the rain that fell sideways and never committed. Malaysian rain was a different species. It fell vertically and it fell completely, a wall of water that descended from the sky with the committed violence of something that had been building all day in the equatorial heat and was now releasing at once. The rain hit the zinc roof of the hostel's third floor with a sound like applause -- no, not applause, like static, like the sound between radio stations turned to maximum volume, a white noise that was simultaneously everywhere and nowhere, that filled the room and the corridor and the air well and the streets below with a roar that made conversation difficult and private.

The rain was useful. Priya understood this instantly. The rain was a wall of sound that contained their words, that kept them in this room, that made the conversation feel sealed, hermetic, a chamber in which two people could speak without the building hearing. Felix understood it too. She saw the flicker of awareness in his eyes -- the recognition of a gift from the weather, the professional's appreciation of an environmental advantage.

"Let me be clear about what I want," Priya said, raising her voice to be heard above the rain. The chamomile cup sat untouched on the desk, the surface of the tea vibrating with the percussion of water on zinc. "I want you to release Connor. Whatever hold you have on him -- the evidence, the threats, the final job -- I want you to let him go. He walks away. No consequences. You find someone else."

"Release him." Felix repeated the word as though tasting it, evaluating its components the way a sommelier evaluates a wine -- not with enjoyment but with professional assessment. "The word implies captivity. Connor isn't captive. Connor is free to walk out of this hostel at any time. He's free to call the police, free to call his embassy, free to fly home to Melbourne. No one is stopping him."

"Except the evidence you've told him you control."

"Evidence is not a chain. Evidence is information. Information exists regardless of what I do with it."

"You told him you'd let the evidence surface if he refused the final job. That's coercion."

"That's a conversation between two adults about the reality of their situation. I didn't create the CCTV footage. I didn't create the fingerprints. I didn't create the bank transfers. Connor did. By choosing to carry the packages, by choosing not to ask what was inside, by choosing, week after week, to walk through a city carrying drugs he pretended were phone chargers. The evidence is Connor's creation. I merely pointed out that it exists."

The logic was impeccable. That was the worst part. The logic was airtight, constructed with the precision of a legal argument, each premise true, each conclusion valid, the whole structure sound and terrible and designed to make the person listening feel that the victim was the author of his own destruction. And in some ways, the logic was correct. Connor had chosen. Connor had carried. Connor had not asked. The machine had run and the machine was Connor's machine and the fuel was Connor's willful ignorance.

But logic was not the same as morality. A system could be logically consistent and morally catastrophic. Priya knew this. She had studied medical ethics. She had read about the Tuskegee experiments, about informed consent, about the difference between a patient who chooses not to take medication and a doctor who fails to prescribe it. Connor's choices had been real, but they had been engineered -- manufactured by a man who understood vulnerability the way an oncologist understood tumour markers, who could identify the precise weakness in a person's structure and apply pressure there, gently, incrementally, until the structure bore the load he needed it to bear.

"You engineered his choices," Priya said. "You identified his weaknesses -- financial pressure, need for belonging, fear of going home -- and you exploited them systematically. That's not two adults making decisions. That's grooming."

Felix set his cup down. The gesture was precise, the ceramic touching the desk's surface without sound, the control of a man who never let objects make noise he hadn't authorised. His expression shifted -- not dramatically, not into anger or defensiveness, but into something cooler, more clinical, the expression of a professional whose time was being used on an argument he'd already won.

"Grooming." He tested the word. "That's a strong word. A medical word, perhaps. Or a legal one. Do you know what word a Malaysian prosecutor would use, Priya? Accomplice. Associate. Co-conspirator. You've been living in the same building as a drug trafficking operation for three weeks. You've been sharing meals with the courier. You've been sleeping with the courier. You've been warned about the operation -- by the receptionist, by the photojournalist, by your own instincts -- and you've remained. You've remained because you love him, which is sympathetic, but the law doesn't weigh sympathy. The law weighs proximity. And your proximity to Connor is zero metres."

The rain intensified. The zinc roof sang. Through the shutters, lightning cracked the sky open over the Petronas Towers, the flash turning the room momentarily white -- the walls, Felix's face, Priya's hands, the untouched chamomile, all bleached to the same flat, clinical white of a hospital corridor, a police station, a room where the colour had been removed because colour was a luxury and this was not a place for luxury.

Thunder followed -- three seconds after the flash, meaning the lightning was approximately one kilometre away, the storm directly overhead, the building a small, trembling thing beneath the weight of equatorial weather that did not care about the people inside it, that came and went according to its own schedule, indifferent to conversations and threats and the precise placement of ceramic cups.

"You're afraid," Felix said. "Good. Fear is useful. Fear is what Connor should have felt five weeks ago, when I asked him to carry an envelope and he said yes without asking what was inside. Fear is the appropriate response to this country's drug laws. But fear, applied correctly, can also be protective. You're afraid for Connor. Use that fear. Use it to keep quiet. Use it to let this play out. Use it to protect your career, your family, your future."

"I'm not afraid of you."

"I know. That's what concerns me." He said this without smiling. The charm had been removed now, stripped away like a layer of paint, revealing the surface underneath -- not ugly, not monstrous, just cold, the smooth, functional coldness of a system that operated without the friction of emotion. "Afraid people are predictable. They run or they freeze or they comply. Brave people are unpredictable. And unpredictable people in my line of work are... complications."

The word *complications* hung in the air. It was not a threat. It was a category -- a classification, the word a bureaucrat uses to describe a problem that has not yet been solved but has been identified and will, at some point, require solving.

"Let him go," Priya said. Her voice was steady. The rain was a wall around them, the room a box inside the wall, the conversation a smaller box inside the room. "Whatever the final job is, cancel it. Let him walk away. He won't go to the police -- he's too afraid. He'll leave KL. You'll never hear from him again."

Felix looked at her for a long time. The look was appraising, the look of a man evaluating a proposal against a set of criteria she couldn't see.

"No," he said.

The word was simple, final, unornamental -- the opposite of everything else Felix had said in this conversation, which had been complex and layered and designed to perform intelligence. The *no* was stripped of performance. It was the raw output of the mechanism, the answer that required no justification because justification was for people who needed approval and Felix needed nothing from Priya except her absence.

"The final job will happen. Connor will carry the suitcase. This is not negotiable. It's not negotiable because the schedule is set, the route is planned, the receiver is waiting, and the product has been packaged. Connor is a component. Components are not negotiable."

"He's a person."

"He's both. The two are not mutually exclusive." Felix stood. The conversation was ending. She could feel it -- the way a consultation ends when the consultant has delivered the diagnosis and the patient's response is no longer medically relevant. "Priya, I like you. I say that without agenda. You're intelligent, you're brave, you see clearly. These are qualities I admire. I am asking you, with genuine respect, to step back. Let this finish. In a week, it will be over. Connor will carry the suitcase, the suitcase will arrive, the money will be transferred, and everyone will go home. Including you."

"And if it doesn't go well? If he's caught?"

"Then the situation is no longer mine to manage. And your involvement -- however well-intentioned -- will make it worse for you, not better for him."

He picked up her untouched cup of chamomile. He poured it down the small sink in the corner of the room -- the private rooms had sinks, a luxury the dorms did not, a luxury that cost RM85 per night and included the privilege of solitude and running water and a door that locked from the inside.

"We're done," he said. Not unkindly. With the finality of a man closing a file.

Priya stood in the room and felt the rain on the roof and the lightning in the sky and the distance between what she wanted to do and what she could do, and the distance was the distance between being right and being powerful, and being right without being powerful was the specific, exquisite torment of every person who had ever watched someone they loved walk toward something that would destroy them and found that love, by itself, could not change the direction.

She walked to the door. She opened it. The corridor was dark, the bathroom light still leaking its fluorescent patience.

"Priya."

She turned.

Felix was standing by the window, his silhouette against the shutters, the rain beyond him a silver curtain lit intermittently by lightning. His face was in shadow. His voice, when he spoke, carried something that might have been, in a different man, regret.

"I told you your father is a cardiologist and your brother is applying to UCL. I didn't tell you how I know. Consider that."

The door closed. Priya stood in the corridor and the information detonated inside her with the delayed-fuse precision of something that had been placed rather than thrown -- the understanding that Felix had not simply Googled her, had not simply asked around, had compiled a file with details that required effort, that required access, that implied a network of information-gathering that extended beyond this hostel, beyond this city, beyond anything she had imagined when she'd climbed the staircase with her clinical confidence and her doctor's knock.

He knew about her family. He knew because knowing was what he did. And the knowing was the threat -- not a spoken threat, not a legal threat, but the ambient threat of being known by someone who used knowledge the way surgeons used scalpels, with precision and without sentiment.

The rain was still falling. The building was shaking with it, the old timbers vibrating, the zinc roof a drum, the air well a column of sound that amplified the storm into something elemental, something older than the building and the people inside it, something that cared about none of this.

Priya went downstairs.

---

She found Connor awake. He was sitting on the edge of Bed 7 in the dark, the dorm lit only by the glow of someone's phone charger -- a small blue LED, the size of a full stop, pulsing in the darkness like a heartbeat. The other bunks held sleeping travellers -- the regular turnover of two-night tourists who passed through the Lantern Hostel like weather, arriving and departing without consequence, their names already fading from the guest ledger before Mei Ling's ink was dry.

Priya sat beside him. The bunk was narrow -- two bodies on a single mattress, their shoulders touching, the proximity forced by architecture and chosen by need. Beneath Connor, the bed frame held Lena's name in its wood, the scratched letters invisible in the dark, the message from a previous occupant who had also trusted Felix and also learned the cost.

"I went to see Felix," she said.

Connor's reaction was immediate. His body tightened -- she felt it through the point of contact at their shoulders, the muscular tension of a man whose fear had been activated by a specific stimulus. He turned to face her. In the blue LED light, his eyes were wide, the pupils dilated, the sympathetic response she had catalogued in herself an hour ago now visible in him.

"You what?"

"I went to his room. I told him to let you go."

"Priya." The word was raw, scraped, the sound of a man hearing something that frightened him more than what Felix had said on the rooftop, because what Felix had said on the rooftop was about Connor's fate and this was about Priya's, and Connor's fear for himself had limits that his fear for her did not. "You can't -- he's not -- you don't understand what he --"

"I understand exactly what he is." Her voice was the clinical voice, the diagnosis voice, the voice that she deployed when the patient was panicking and the panic was justified but the panic would not help. "He's a trafficker who uses backpackers as mules and discards them when they're caught. He's meticulous, he's prepared, and he has no intention of releasing you from the final job."

"Did he threaten you?"

"He informed me. There's a difference, apparently." The dark humour was involuntary, the sardonic reflex of a person processing something terrible and reaching for the only tool available -- the scalpel of irony, the small, sharp instrument that let you cut the thing into pieces small enough to examine. "He knows about my family. My dad's hospital. Arjun's uni application. He's compiled a file."

Connor pressed his palms against his eyes. The gesture was the gesture of a man trying to hold something in or push something out, the physical equivalent of the machine's last, desperate rationalisation attempt -- except the machine was broken now, had been broken on the rooftop, and what remained was not a mechanism but a man, twenty-seven years old, sitting on a bunk bed in the dark in a city where the law was a wall and the wall was closing and the man who had built the wall was three floors above them, drinking chamomile and reading Goethe.

"We have to leave," Priya said. "Now. Tonight. We pack, we go to KL Sentral, we get on the first train to the airport, and we fly out. Singapore, Bangkok, anywhere. We leave and we don't come back."

"I can't."

"You can. There's nothing physically stopping you from walking out that door --"

"The evidence." Connor's voice was a whisper, the whisper of a man who had learned a new geography of fear and was still mapping its borders. "He told me everything, Priya. On the rooftop. The packages were meth. All of them. Every delivery I've made for five weeks -- methamphetamine. He told me the weights. He told me the totals. I've carried... the number is... it's thousands of grams. Thousands. And every pickup, every drop, there's CCTV. Every package has my fingerprints. The burner phone has every instruction. My bank account has fourteen thousand ringgit in deposits that trace back to the network."

He lowered his hands. In the blue light, his face was the face from the common room an hour ago -- drained, vacant, the face of a man reporting from inside the ruin.

"If I run, the evidence surfaces. Not from Felix -- he doesn't need to do anything. The footage exists. The records exist. He said he'd stop protecting me. That's all it takes. The police find the footage. My face, my fingerprints, the packages. And the amount... Priya, the amount is so far above the threshold that the threshold is meaningless. Fifty grams triggers the death penalty. I've carried thousands. Thousands of grams. Of methamphetamine. In Malaysia."

The rain was easing. The drumming on the roof was softer now, the storm passing eastward over the city, the thunder receding like retreating artillery, leaving behind the dripping aftermath -- water running through the gutters, pooling in the air well, the old building releasing the rain from its surfaces the way an animal shakes water from its coat.

"The card," Priya said. "Sergeant Ahmad's card. You still have it."

"I have it."

"Then we call him. We call him now. You turn yourself in. You cooperate. You give them Felix's name, Wei's name, the locations, the schedule -- everything. Voluntary cooperation. It has to count for something."

"Felix said it wouldn't. He said his name isn't in my phone. His fingerprints aren't on the packages. He's not on the CCTV. It would be my word against his -- a drug mule's word against a tourist's."

"Then we go to the Australian embassy --"

"And tell them what? That I've been trafficking methamphetamine for five weeks? That I've made fourteen deliveries? The embassy can't override Malaysian law. The embassy can't make the CCTV disappear. All the embassy can do is assign me a lawyer and the lawyer would tell me exactly what Felix already told me: the evidence is overwhelming, the sentence is mandatory, and no amount of cooperating changes the fact that I carried enough methamphetamine to qualify for the death penalty fifteen times over."

Priya was quiet. The quiet was not agreement -- it was the quiet of a diagnostician who has been presented with a case where every treatment has contraindications and the disease is progressing and the patient is sitting in front of her in the dark, waiting for the answer that she, with all her training and all her intelligence and all her love, did not have.

Because Connor was right. Not about everything -- not about the futility of cooperation, not about the embassy's impotence, not about the finality of the evidence. But about the shape of the trap. The trap was real. Felix had built it over five weeks with the patience and precision of an engineer, and the trap was not a cage with visible bars but a set of consequences that activated upon exit, a system in which every escape route triggered a worse outcome than staying, in which the only safe direction was forward, into the final job, into the suitcase, into the bus to Penang.

The trap was a funnel. And the funnel's narrow end was a highway checkpoint where the dogs would smell what the suitcase contained and the officers would open the lining and Connor would stand on the shoulder of the North-South Expressway while the traffic streamed past and the handcuffs closed and the world ended.

She didn't know this yet. She knew the shape, not the specifics. But the shape was enough to understand that the conversation in Felix's room had not been a negotiation but a notification -- the notification of a man who had already decided and was extending the courtesy of explaining the decision to the people who would be affected by it, the way a surgeon explains the procedure before performing it, the explanation not changing the outcome but making the outcome feel, briefly, participatory.

"He offered me chamomile tea," Priya said.

The sentence came from nowhere and went nowhere. It was a factual statement about a beverage. And yet, in the context of the conversation, in the dark of the dorm, on a night when a man had calmly explained why another man's life was forfeit and why a woman's interference would only add her to the casualty list, the sentence was also the most terrifying thing Priya had said, because it captured the thing about Felix that no amount of analysis could adequately describe: the normalcy of him. The politeness. The chamomile.

The worst people she had encountered in medical school were not the ones who raged or threatened or lost control. They were the ones who maintained perfect composure while delivering devastating news, who offered tea while explaining that your mother was dying, who smiled while signing the forms that committed you. Felix was that kind of person. Felix was the consultant who looked you in the eye and told you the prognosis was terminal and then asked if you'd like a biscuit.

Connor reached for her hand. She took it. Their fingers interlaced in the dark, the grip tight, the grip of two people holding on to each other because everything else was coming loose and the human hand was the only anchor available.

"I'm not leaving without you," she said.

"I know."

"And I'm not letting you carry that suitcase."

Connor said nothing. The silence was the sound of a man who wanted to believe what she'd said but knew, with the terrible new clarity that Felix's rooftop confession had given him, that wanting and believing were different operations and that believing, in this case, required a plan, and the plan required a way out, and the way out was the thing that did not exist.

The rain had stopped. The silence after a KL thunderstorm was always absolute -- a held breath, the city suspended in the aftermath, the gutters still running, the leaves still dripping, the air scrubbed clean and smelling of ozone and wet concrete and the vegetal sweetness of tropical plants released from the heat. Through the air well, the clouds were breaking. A single star appeared, then another, the sky reassembling itself with the casual efficiency of a city that had weathered this storm ten thousand times and would weather it ten thousand more.

In Bed 7, in Dorm 3, on the second floor of the Lantern Hostel, two people held hands in the dark and felt the shape of what was coming and did not speak because speaking required language and language required hope and hope was the thing that Felix Decker, on a rooftop and in a private room and in five weeks of careful, patient engineering, had methodically and completely removed.

The blue LED pulsed. The ceiling fan turned. And somewhere above them, on the third floor, a man drank the last of his chamomile tea and opened his Goethe to the bookmarked page and read in the clean, fluorescent-free darkness of his room, waiting for morning, waiting for the schedule, waiting for the component to perform its final function.

The storm moved east. The city dried. And the morning was coming, as mornings always came in KL -- sudden, bright, and merciless.
