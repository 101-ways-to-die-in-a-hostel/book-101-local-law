# Chapter 25: No Exit

The morning after the CCTV footage, Connor woke to the sound of the call to prayer and the certainty that he was finished.

Not the breezy, half-formed certainty of the past five weeks -- the certainty that things would be fine, that she'd be right, that Australia would protect him, that consequences were for people who lacked his particular brand of charm. This was the other kind. The geological kind. The kind that arrived when the last layer of sediment settled and the fossil record was complete and the thing that had been alive was now preserved in its final position, every bone accounted for, every joint locked, the posture of death fixed for anyone who cared to dig.

He lay in Bed 7 and stared at the ceiling. The fan turned. The blades chopped the amber light from the air well into slices -- light, shadow, light, shadow -- a rhythm that was neither comforting nor threatening but simply mechanical, the building's heartbeat, indifferent to the state of the bodies it sheltered.

The CCTV footage played behind his eyes. Felix had shown it to him last night on a laptop screen in Private Room 1 -- the screen angled like a confession booth's partition, the footage queued and timestamped, a curated retrospective of Connor's career as a drug mule. There he was at Wei's shop, entering through the front door, exiting with a brown paper package. There he was at the Sentul warehouse, red backpack on his shoulders, walking through the loading dock. There he was outside Danny's karaoke bar, handing over a shoebox-sized parcel to a man whose face was conveniently turned from the camera while Connor's was not. Fourteen clips. Fourteen deliveries. Fourteen individual pieces of evidence that, taken together, constructed a portrait so complete and so damning that no embassy, no lawyer, no amount of Australian passport privilege could dismantle it.

And then there was the name.

LENA.

He'd finally looked at the bed frame. Two nights ago, after Felix's revelation on the rooftop, after the numbers and the gloves and the suitcase to Penang, Connor had returned to Bed 7 and, for the first time in five weeks, run his fingers along the wooden edge where something had been scratched. The letters were crude, carved with a key or a nail, the wood splintered at the curves: L-E-N-A. Below the name, a date: 14/03/25. Below the date, a single word in Swedish that Connor couldn't read but that Priya later translated from a dictionary app, her voice going quiet as the meaning assembled itself: *forlat*. Forgive.

Lena Ekström. Twenty-two. Swedish. Bed 7 before Connor. Recruited by Felix six months before Connor arrived. Arrested carrying 200 grams of methamphetamine at the Thai-Malaysian border crossing at Bukit Kayu Hitam. Currently in Kajang Prison, forty kilometres south of KL, awaiting trial under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. Mandatory death penalty if convicted.

Felix had told him this with the same clinical precision he'd used for the CCTV footage -- a case study, a precedent, a data point in the operational history of a system that processed human beings the way Wei's vacuum sealer processed plastic bags: efficiently, completely, with no residual air.

"Lena was good," Felix had said. "Better than you, actually. More disciplined. She lasted four months. But she got emotional. Started asking questions. Started talking to other guests. She made the same mistake you're making -- she thought the exit was behind her. It's not. The exit is in front. One more job, and the exit opens."

The exit. The suitcase. Penang.

Connor rolled out of bed. The dorm was half-empty -- two beds occupied by travelers he didn't know, new arrivals who hadn't been here long enough to acquire names or histories or the grey, under-lit complexion that came from sleeping in Dorm 3's windowless depths. They were still in the early stage of hostel life, the stage Connor had occupied five weeks ago, when the Lantern was an adventure and Felix was a friend and the red lanterns were charming rather than ominous. They slept like people who had nothing to fear. Connor envied them with a violence that surprised him.

He dressed. Board shorts. A singlet that read BALI OR BUST in faded letters. Flip-flops. The uniform of a man who had curated his identity around not caring and was now trapped inside the costume, unable to change clothes because changing clothes would mean admitting that the costume had been a lie and the lie had been the architecture of his destruction.

The blue travel towel was under his pillow. He left it there.

---

He found Felix in the common room at nine, drinking black coffee from a tin mug and reading something on his phone with the focused attention of a man reviewing reports. The common room was quiet -- the mid-morning lull between breakfast chaos and the afternoon drift of returned day-trippers. The TV showed a cooking competition in Malay. The ceiling fans turned. The bookshelf of abandoned novels held its silent inventory of stories other people had left behind.

"I'm done," Connor said.

He said it standing. He said it without sitting down, without accepting the chair that the geography of their conversations had always assigned him, the subordinate chair, the chair that faced Felix's chair the way a student's desk faces the teacher's. He stood, and the standing was deliberate, and the deliberation was the first conscious act of resistance Connor had performed in five weeks.

Felix looked up from his phone. His expression didn't change. It didn't change because Felix's expression was a controlled variable, calibrated and maintained, the public interface of a system whose internal workings were not available for inspection. He set the phone face-down on the table.

"Sit down, Connor."

"No."

The word hung in the air. It was a small word, two letters, one syllable, and it was the first time Connor had deployed it against Felix. In five weeks of escalating favours and rationalised compliance and the steady downward slope of a man who had never learned to refuse, the word *no* had been absent from their vocabulary. Its appearance now was as conspicuous as a fire alarm in a library.

Felix studied him. The study was brief, clinical, the assessment of an engineer examining a component that had begun to deviate from its expected performance parameters.

"All right," Felix said. "Stand, then. It doesn't change anything."

"I'm done with the deliveries. I'm done with the packages. I'm done with Wei and Danny and the suitcase and Penang and all of it. I'm not carrying anything else for you."

Connor's voice was steady. Not confident -- confidence was a different architecture, built on certainty and self-regard, and Connor's self-regard had been demolished by the CCTV footage. But steady. The steadiness of a man who had run out of options for compliance and had found, at the bottom of that emptiness, the thin, cold floor of refusal.

Felix leaned back in his chair. He crossed one leg over the other. His leather sandals were clean, his linen shirt unwrinkled, his presence in the common room carrying the same effortless authority it had carried on the first night, when he'd materialised in this same space and offered Connor a beer and a future that was neither.

"I understand," Felix said. "You're scared. The footage upset you. Lena's story upset you. That's a normal reaction. I'd be worried if you weren't upset."

"I'm not upset. I'm done."

"You're done." Felix repeated the words the way a therapist repeats a patient's statement -- reflectively, without judgement, creating the space for the patient to hear their own words and recognise the emotion beneath them. "And what does 'done' look like, Connor? Practically. What does done look like tomorrow, next week, when you're sitting in this common room or standing at an immigration counter or walking through an airport?"

"I leave. I fly home. Melbourne. I'm gone."

"And the footage?"

The question was a nail. Quiet, precise, driven with a single tap into the exact centre of Connor's plan, the structural weakness that Connor had identified and chosen to ignore because ignoring structural weaknesses was what he did, it was his fundamental skill, the skill that had built his life and was now dismantling it.

"You wouldn't."

"I wouldn't need to. The footage exists on servers I don't control. Wei's shop has its own CCTV system -- the footage uploads automatically to a cloud service in Singapore. Mr. Tan's building has a security company that archives footage for twelve months. The Sentul warehouse uses a third-party monitoring service. I didn't create this surveillance architecture, Connor. I simply operated within it. The footage exists whether I want it to or not."

"Then delete it."

"I can't delete footage from systems I don't own. I can make certain that it doesn't reach the police. That's what I've been doing. That's what I'll continue to do, provided our arrangement continues."

The logic was airtight. The logic had always been airtight, because Felix built his systems the way engineers built bridges -- with redundancy, with failsafes, with the understanding that the structure must hold under stress. The CCTV footage was not leverage Felix held; it was leverage that existed independently, a natural consequence of Connor's actions, a trail that could not be unwalked. Felix's power was not that he could release the footage but that he could suppress it. He was not the threat. He was the shield against the threat. And the price of the shield was the suitcase.

Connor felt the refusal -- his two-letter, one-syllable act of resistance -- collide with the architecture of his entrapment and shatter. Not loudly. Not dramatically. The way ice cracks on a pond: a sound that belongs to the surface, while the water beneath continues, cold and dark and indifferent.

"One job," Felix said. "Penang. Then I suppress the footage permanently. I delete what I can access, and I ensure the rest is overwritten by time. Twelve months, the archive cycles. You'll be in Melbourne by then. The footage will be gone. You'll be free."

Free. The word was a trapdoor. It looked like solid ground, but the hinges were visible if you knew where to look, and Connor now knew where to look, and he could see the hinges, and beneath the trapdoor was the same void that had always been there -- the void of a system that processed people and discarded them when the processing was complete.

Connor opened his mouth to respond, but the staircase creaked -- the distinctive three-note groan of weight on old timber, the sound the building made when someone descended from the upper floors heavy-footed, load-bearing, the staircase protesting each step.

Uncle Razak appeared in the common room doorway.

---

Razak bin Omar was sixty-three years old and had owned the Lantern Hostel for seventeen years, and in those seventeen years he had perfected the art of knowing things he wished he didn't know.

He stood in the doorway in his usual outfit -- batik shirt, loose cotton trousers, leather sandals that slapped the tile with each step. His reading glasses were pushed up onto his forehead, catching the amber light from the paper lanterns. In his left hand, he held a rolled newspaper. In his right, nothing. But the nothing was the kind of nothing that occupies a hand that wants to hold something -- a weapon, a phone, a piece of paper that changes the terms of an arrangement.

His face was set in an expression Connor had never seen on him. In five weeks at the Lantern, Connor had seen Razak jovial (the default), conspiratorial (the office, the map, the red pins), melancholy (late nights on the rooftop, stories about the building's ghosts), and occasionally stern (a guest caught smoking inside, a noise complaint). But this expression was none of those. This was the expression of a man approaching a confrontation he had spent weeks avoiding and could no longer defer.

"Felix." Razak's voice was flat. The joviality stripped out, the way furniture is stripped from a room before it is demolished. "We need to talk."

Felix's posture didn't change. He remained in his chair, one leg crossed, coffee in hand, the picture of a man whose morning had not been interrupted. "Of course, Uncle. Sit down."

"Don't call me Uncle. Not today." Razak entered the common room. He did not sit. He stood where Connor had stood -- in the geography of refusal, the vertical space reserved for people who had come to say things they could not say from a seated position. "We had an agreement."

"We did."

"The agreement was clear. Your people don't recruit from my hostel. My guests are not your-- your *inventory*." The word came out with the particular venom of a man who had spent too long holding it in his mouth. "You do your business elsewhere. I don't see it. I don't report it. That was the deal."

"That was the deal," Felix agreed.

"You broke it."

Felix sipped his coffee. The sip was measured, unhurried, the act of a man who controlled the tempo of every conversation he entered. He set the mug down on the table with a soft click.

"Connor came to me," Felix said. "He was broke. He was desperate. He was asking anyone who would listen for ways to make money. I didn't recruit him, Razak. He applied."

"Bullshit." The English profanity in Razak's mouth was startling -- Razak, who defaulted to Malay for emotion, who spoke English with the measured courtesy of a man who had learned it as a tool of commerce. "Bullshit. I watched you. I watched you work him. The beer on the first night. The stories. The cash. The private room you use as an office. You recruited him the way you recruited Lena."

The name landed in the room like a stone in a still pond. Lena. The Swedish girl. Bed 7 before Connor. The name that was scratched into the wood. The name that connected the present to the past, the current victim to the previous one, the ongoing operation to its archive.

Felix's expression shifted -- a micro-adjustment, the barest contraction of the muscles around his eyes, the response of a man who had heard something he hadn't expected. Not Lena's name -- he knew Connor had learned about Lena. But Lena's name in Razak's mouth. That was different. That meant Razak had been paying closer attention than Felix had calculated.

"Lena was a different situation," Felix said.

"Lena was the same situation. You sat in my hostel. You drank my coffee. You used my wifi. You slept in my bed. And you fed my guests to your machine. That was not the arrangement."

Razak's voice had risen. Not to a shout -- Razak was not a shouting man -- but to a register that occupied the space between speech and declaration, the voice of a man making a formal accusation in a room that was not a courtroom but felt like one.

Connor stood frozen against the wall near the bookshelf. He was witnessing something he had not expected: the hostel owner, the man with the map of the dead, the collector of tragedies, confronting the architect of the current one. There was something almost noble in it -- Razak's anger, his refusal to remain complicit, his decision to cross the line between passive knowledge and active intervention.

The nobility lasted approximately forty-five seconds.

"You're going to stop," Razak said. "Today. Now. You're going to release this boy from whatever you've got him carrying, and then you're going to leave my hostel. If you don't, I'll call the police."

"The police." Felix set down his coffee. He uncrossed his legs. He stood. The standing was slow, deliberate, the vertical ascent of a man who had decided that the conversation required a different posture. "You'll call the police."

"Inspector Shah at Dang Wangi. I have his number. I'll call him now."

"And tell him what?"

"That you're running drugs through my property. That you're using my guests as couriers. That my hostel is being used as a base for--"

"For a trafficking operation that you've known about for two years."

The sentence cut Razak's speech like a scalpel. Clean, precise, the incision made at the exact point where the tissue was weakest.

Razak stopped. His mouth remained open for a moment -- the physical aftermath of a sentence that had been severed mid-delivery, the momentum of speech colliding with the sudden absence of words to carry it.

"Two years," Felix continued. His voice had not risen. It had not needed to. Volume was a tool for people who lacked precision, and Felix was nothing if not precise. "You've known about the network since before I arrived. You knew about the couriers. You knew about Wei's shop. You knew that Lena was carrying packages and you said nothing. You knew that the packages contained methamphetamine and you said nothing. You knew that Lena was arrested and you said nothing. You accepted a reduction in rent on your third-floor private room -- a room that costs sixty ringgit per night but that I pay one hundred and twenty for, a premium that you never questioned because questioning it would require you to acknowledge what the premium was purchasing."

Each sentence was a pin. Not the red pins on Razak's map -- not the pins that marked other people's deaths in other hostels in other countries. These were pins in Razak's own map, marking the points where his complicity had been documented, timestamped, archived.

"I've been here nine months," Felix said. "In those nine months, I've paid you RM32,400 in rent. Cash. No receipts. No tax declarations. An amount that, were the Inland Revenue Board to investigate, would reveal not only an unreported income stream but a pattern of financial behaviour that is, under Malaysian law, consistent with money laundering."

Razak's face changed. The anger drained from it the way colour drains from a sunset -- gradually, then all at once, leaving behind a landscape that was recognisable but fundamentally altered. What remained was not anger but something older: the expression of a man who has walked into a trap while believing he was springing one.

"Then there's the building," Felix said. "The rooftop terrace -- constructed in 2012 without a building permit. The fire escape on the second floor -- blocked by the storage room you converted into Private Room 2. The electrical wiring on the third floor -- substandard, uninspected, a violation of the Uniform Building By-Laws. The maximum occupancy rating for a structure of this type -- forty persons. You have forty-two beds. That's before we discuss the food preparation area and its compliance with the Food Act 1983, or the question of whether Mama Siti has a valid food handler's certificate."

Felix recited the violations the way a doctor recites symptoms -- systematically, without urgency, each item contributing to a diagnosis that was already known but had not yet been spoken aloud. He had done his research. He had done his research the way he did everything: thoroughly, patiently, with the understanding that information was currency and currency was power and power was the ability to stand in a man's common room and dismantle his moral authority piece by piece.

"You're a collector of dead backpackers, Razak." Felix's voice was quiet now, conversational, almost friendly -- the return of the charm, weaponised. "Would you like to add one from your own hostel?"

The question sat in the room. It sat between the ceiling fans and the cooking competition on the TV and the abandoned novels on the bookshelf. It sat in the amber light of the paper lanterns that Razak had hung himself, one by one, when he'd opened the Lantern in 2009 with the dream of creating a haven, a home away from home, a place where travelers could rest and be safe. The question sat on that dream and crushed it.

Razak looked at Felix. Felix looked at Razak. The look between them was not the look of enemies -- it was the look of two men who had made a transaction and were now confronting the terms, the fine print, the clauses that neither had wanted to read but both had signed.

"You knew." Razak's voice was barely audible. "You knew all of this before you moved in."

"I knew the building codes within the first week. The tax situation within the first month. The rest was observation. I'm a careful tenant, Razak. I pay attention to my home."

Home. The word was an obscenity in Felix's mouth -- the appropriation of a concept that Felix had no use for except as leverage, the linguistic equivalent of picking up a family photograph and holding it hostage.

Razak's hand -- the empty one, the one that had wanted to hold a weapon -- dropped to his side. His shoulders, which had been squared for the confrontation, settled into a different configuration, a lower one, the posture of a man absorbing a blow to the body rather than the face. The newspaper in his other hand crumpled slightly as his grip tightened, then loosened, then tightened again -- the physical syntax of a decision being made and unmade and made again in the space between breaths.

"What do you want?" Razak said.

It was the same question Connor had asked on the rooftop. The same two notes, the same defeated melody, the sound of a man who has run out of cards and is asking to see the dealer's hand.

"I want what I've always wanted. To conduct my business without interference. To use Private Room 1. To come and go without questions. And to have one more conversation with Connor about a suitcase."

Razak looked at Connor. The look was the worst part -- worse than Felix's leverage, worse than the building code violations, worse than the tax evasion. The look was apologetic. It was the look of a man who had come downstairs to rescue someone and was leaving without having rescued anyone, including himself.

"I'm sorry, anak," Razak said. *Anak.* Child. The Malay word for the thing you protect, the thing you fail to protect, the thing whose suffering you carry because carrying it is all you can do when you cannot prevent it.

He turned. He walked to the staircase. The building groaned as he ascended -- the three-note creak of old wood under the weight of a man who was heavier now than when he'd descended, heavier with the knowledge that he had made a bargain with a devil and the devil had kept better records.

The common room was quiet. The cooking competition played. The ceiling fans turned. And Felix sat back down and picked up his coffee and drank it as though nothing had happened, because for Felix, nothing had. The confrontation was a line item, a risk managed, a variable controlled. It had consumed twelve minutes of his morning and would not consume twelve more.

Connor stood against the bookshelf and watched the man who owned his fate drink coffee with the placid satisfaction of someone who has won an argument by never raising his voice.

---

The hours after Razak's retreat were the longest of Connor's life. Longer than the overnight flight from Melbourne to Bali four years ago, when he'd sat in 43C and vibrated with the excitement of a life about to begin. Longer than the wait for his A-level results, which he'd failed, which his parents had absorbed with the quiet disappointment of people who had expected exactly this. Longer than any night in any hostel in any country, because the thing he was waiting for was not arrival or departure or results but the clarification of a future that had narrowed to a corridor with no doors.

He sat on the rooftop. The plastic chair was warm from the afternoon sun. The humidity pressed against his skin like something worn. Below, Petaling Street conducted its daily commerce -- the market stalls, the phone repair shops, the Chinese medicine stores, the temple with its incense and its bells, the ordinary infrastructure of a city that did not know or care that one of its residents was sitting on an illegal rooftop terrace trying to decide whether to run.

Running. The word circled his mind like a bird over wreckage -- orbiting, descending, never landing. He could run. He could pack his bag -- the backpack with the compass tattoo's twin, the backpack that had carried him through twelve countries and now carried the weight of fourteen deliveries. He could walk to KL Sentral, buy a ticket to the airport, and be on a plane to Melbourne before Felix finished his coffee. He could be in Hawthorn by tomorrow night, in his childhood bedroom, in the bed that still had the Manchester United duvet from when he was fifteen, and the whole thing -- Felix, the packages, the CCTV, Lena, the suitcase -- would be behind him.

Except it wouldn't. The footage existed on servers in Singapore. The bank transfers existed in systems that crossed borders. The evidence was digital, distributed, persistent -- it lived in the cloud, and the cloud was everywhere, and everywhere was exactly where Connor would be when the footage surfaced. It could surface tomorrow or in six months or in two years. It could surface when he applied for a job and a background check flagged his name. It could surface when he tried to enter another country and an immigration database connected his face to a CCTV still from a phone repair shop in Chinatown. It could surface when a Malaysian investigation into the trafficking network reached the archive footage and there, on a screen in a police station, was Connor James Briggs, walking through a door with a package that contained methamphetamine, his face clear, his intent evident, his guilt preserved in 1080p resolution.

Running solved nothing. Running deferred. And the deferral had a cost, because the cost of the footage was not what it could do to him now but what it could do to him later, in a future that extended decades beyond this rooftop, this city, this afternoon.

His phone buzzed. Not the burner -- his real phone, the cracked iPhone with the sunset wallpaper and the Instagram icon and the 4,200 followers who thought he was living his best life. A message from an unknown number.

*Connor. It's Priya. I'm using the hostel computer to message you. I need to see you. The courtyard. Twenty minutes. Don't tell Felix. Please.*

He read it twice. The message was different from Priya's usual communication -- no emojis, no exclamation marks, no warmth. The tone was clinical, urgent, the tone of a medical student reporting a critical finding.

He descended. The staircase creaked. The building noted his passage and filed it with the others -- the thousands of descents by the thousands of guests who had walked these stairs over ninety-eight years, each one recorded in the wood's memory, each one a variation on the same theme: a person moving through a building that would outlast them.

---

The courtyard was the Lantern's heart -- the air well that cut through the centre of the shophouse, open to the sky, the walls rising three stories on all sides like the interior of a well. The mosaic tile bench sat beneath a frangipani tree whose roots had cracked the tiles decades ago and whose branches now reached toward the square of sky above with the slow ambition of something that had learned to grow in confined spaces. Laundry lines crisscrossed the air well at the second-floor level, strung with the drying garments of travelers -- a batik sarong, a pair of board shorts, a sports bra, a Tottenham Hotspur jersey. The light came from above, filtered through the laundry and the frangipani and the humid air, arriving at ground level as something diffuse and green, the light of an aquarium.

Priya was already there. She sat on the bench in jeans and a white T-shirt, her hair braided, her glasses pushed up her nose, her hands holding a phone that was not her own. It was a prepaid phone, the kind you bought at a 7-Eleven for thirty ringgit, the kind that had no history and no future and existed only for the transaction it was purchased to facilitate.

"Sit," she said.

He sat. The bench was cool despite the heat -- the mosaic tiles holding the morning's chill, the frangipani's shade doing its work. Above, the square of sky was white with humidity, the sun behind the cloud cover like a lamp behind gauze.

"I have a plan," Priya said.

She said it the way she said everything now -- without preamble, without the soft approach she'd used in the early weeks when she'd been trying to warn him without scaring him. The soft approach was over. The soft approach had been a luxury of a time when the danger was theoretical. The danger was no longer theoretical. The danger had a face and a name and a suitcase.

"The Australian embassy is on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng. Twenty minutes from here by Grab. I've looked up their services. They provide consular assistance to Australian citizens in distress, including -- and I'm reading this directly -- 'Australians who find themselves in legal difficulty or who believe they are being coerced into illegal activity.'"

She showed him the phone's screen. The embassy website, loaded in a browser, the Australian coat of arms at the top -- the kangaroo and the emu, the animals that could not walk backwards, the national emblem of a country that was supposed to move forward and protect its own and provide the safety net that Connor had never believed he needed until the floor dropped.

"If you walk in there and tell them everything -- Felix, the packages, the CCTV, the suitcase -- they can help you. They can contact the Malaysian police through diplomatic channels. They can arrange for your evidence to be given in a way that protects you as a witness rather than prosecutes you as a suspect. They can get you home."

The plan was coherent. The plan was intelligent. The plan was the product of a fourth-year medical student's mind -- analytical, systematic, following the diagnostic pathway from symptom to treatment with the rigour that her training demanded.

"I've booked a Grab for 4 PM," Priya continued. "I'm coming with you. We go in together. You tell them everything. If they can't help immediately, we ask for asylum in the embassy -- I don't know if that's actually how it works, but we ask. We don't leave until there's a plan. A real plan. Not Felix's plan. A plan that gets you out of this alive."

Connor looked at her. She was magnificent in her determination -- the glasses, the braid, the phone held like a weapon, the jaw set -- locked, forward, the jaw of a person who has decided to save someone and will not be dissuaded. She was everything he had failed to be: careful, courageous, willing to do the hard thing instead of the easy one. She was his opposite, his complement, the person he would have been if he had been better, and her plan was the door he should have walked through weeks ago.

"Okay," he said.

The word came out small. Not the performative *okay* of the common room, the *okay* that Priya had celebrated and Felix had overridden. This was smaller, quieter, the *okay* of a man who had been reduced to his simplest components and was operating on the last of something -- hope, energy, the residual human impulse to survive.

"Okay," Priya repeated. She smiled. The smile was brief, cautious, the smile of a doctor who has seen a positive test result but knows that the treatment is still ahead. "Four o'clock. I'll meet you here. Bring your passport and any documentation you have. Leave the burner phone in the dorm."

"Priya."

"Yes."

"If this doesn't work--"

"It will work."

"If it doesn't. If Felix finds out. If the footage--"

"Connor." She put her hand on his. The jade bracelet -- the one he'd bought her at the night market, in a different life, in a life where he was a tourist buying a gift for a girl and not a drug mule planning an escape -- rested between their wrists. "It will work. I'm not going to let this happen to you."

He almost believed her. He almost believed her the way a drowning man almost believes the rope that appears above him -- wanting to believe, needing to believe, the belief itself a form of oxygen. He almost reached for the rope.

His pocket buzzed.

The burner phone. The phone Felix had given him on Day 15 with the instructions and the schedule and the contacts. The phone that was a leash disguised as a tool, a chain disguised as a convenience.

He pulled it out. Priya's eyes followed the phone, tracked it from his pocket to his palm, watched the screen illuminate with the sick recognition of someone who has seen this device before and knows what it means.

A message from Felix. No text. Just a photograph.

The photograph was a CCTV still. The timestamp read 14:47, three days ago. The location was the entrance to Wei's phone repair shop. In the image, a figure in board shorts and a faded singlet was walking through the door carrying a daypack. The figure's face was clear -- the sun-bleached hair, the perpetual squint, the compass tattoo on the exposed forearm. Below the image, a single word:

*Remember.*

Connor stared at the photograph. The photograph stared back. It was him. It was incontrovertibly, irrefutably, permanently him. Not a version of him, not an approximation, not a figure that could be mistaken for someone else. It was Connor James Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian, entering a drug packaging facility in Chinatown, Kuala Lumpur, on a date and at a time that could be verified against delivery records and payment transfers and the testimony of every person who had handled the packages he'd carried.

The rope above the drowning man dissolved.

"What is it?" Priya reached for the phone. He let her take it. She looked at the screen. Her expression underwent the journey from hope to understanding to a stillness -- held, heavy, the stillness of someone who has just measured the size of what they're fighting and found it larger than themselves.

"He's watching," she said. Not a question. A diagnosis.

"He's always watching."

Priya set the phone on the bench between them. The CCTV still glowed on the small screen, Connor's pixelated face staring upward at the sky like a man looking for something that wasn't there.

"The embassy plan--" she started.

"He'll know. He'll know I'm going. He'll know before I get there. He knows everything, Priya. He knew about Razak before Razak even came downstairs this morning. He knew about Tomoko's photos before she showed them to me. He has cameras, contacts, people. If I walk into the embassy, the footage goes to the police. Not tomorrow. Today. Before I can explain. Before I can tell my side. The footage goes, and the footage is a death sentence."

He was not being dramatic. He was being accurate. Under Section 39B, the footage of Connor carrying packages from a known drug packaging facility was presumptive evidence of trafficking. The presumption was rebuttable -- in theory, in a courtroom, with a lawyer, over months of legal proceedings. But the footage's release would trigger his arrest, and his arrest would place him in the Malaysian criminal justice system, and the system was not designed for nuance or for the protestation of Australian backpackers who claimed they didn't know what they were carrying. The system was designed for processing. The system was designed for results. The system was, as Priya herself had told him in Chapter 14, a machine that, once activated, was nearly impossible to stop.

"Then what?" Priya said. "What's your plan? Carry the suitcase? Do the job? Trust Felix to let you go?"

"I don't have a plan."

"That's not good enough."

"I know."

They sat on the bench in the courtyard and the frangipani dropped a flower -- a single white petal, spiralling down through the air well's enclosed atmosphere, landing on the mosaic tiles between their feet. The petal was perfect, unblemished, fallen not because of damage but because the tree was programmed to release, and the releasing was part of the cycle, and the cycle was indifferent to the petal's condition. Things fell because falling was what they did when the structure that held them was no longer sufficient.

Priya stood. She picked up the prepaid phone. She looked at Connor with an expression that contained the entire architecture of their relationship -- the attraction, the warning, the love, the frustration, the diagnosis, the prognosis.

"I'm cancelling the Grab," she said. "But I'm not giving up. I need to think. There has to be a way that doesn't depend on Felix letting you go and doesn't require you to walk into the police with the footage still out there."

She left. The courtyard held her absence the way it held everything -- in the mosaic tiles, in the frangipani branches, in the laundry that dried slowly in the humid air. Connor sat on the bench and held the burner phone and the CCTV still of himself and felt the last escape route seal shut with the quiet precision of a door closing in a hospital, the rubber seal meeting the frame, the click of the mechanism engaging, the air on the other side becoming inaccessible.

Upstairs, in his office on the second floor, Razak bin Omar sat at his desk and stared at the map of the dead.

The map covered most of the wall behind his desk -- a large-format world map, the kind sold in educational supply stores, the continents in muted greens and browns, the oceans in pale blue. Red pins marked the locations of hostel deaths he had collected over seventeen years. There were sixty-three pins. Buenos Aires, three. Bangkok, seven. Barcelona, two. Berlin, one. Hanoi, four. Kathmandu, two. Each pin was a story. Each story was a death. Each death was a failure -- of awareness, of precaution, of the basic survival instinct that travelers abandoned when they crossed borders and entered the liminal space of the hostel, the space between home and away, the space where the rules of one world no longer applied and the rules of the other had not yet been learned.

He had started the collection in 2009, when the hostel opened. A guest in the first year had fallen from a balcony in Siem Reap before coming to the Lantern -- she'd told the story in the common room, the balcony railing that gave way, the three-story fall, the hospital in Phnom Penh. Razak had been horrified and fascinated. He'd found the news article online. He'd printed it. He'd put a pin in Cambodia. And the collection had grown, article by article, death by death, until the map was not a collection but a cartography of vulnerability, a visual record of what happened when people traveled without understanding where they were.

He had never imagined that a pin would go in Kuala Lumpur. He had never imagined that the pin would be for his own hostel.

But the pin was coming. He could feel it in the building's bones, in the creak of the staircase, in the way Mama Siti had stopped singing in the kitchen, in the way Aziz stood in the alley and smoked with the particular intensity of a man who was watching something approach and had decided not to move.

Felix had won. The admission was bitter, metallic, the taste of a coin held too long in the mouth. Felix had won because Felix had prepared, and Razak had not prepared, because Razak had believed that the arrangement -- the tacit agreement, the gentleman's understanding -- was sufficient protection against a man who was not a gentleman and did not understand things but engineered them.

The building code violations. The rooftop terrace. The fire escape. The wiring. The occupancy rating. The tax evasion. The cash payments. Each item was real. Each item was a violation that Razak had committed knowingly, with the rationalisation that every small business owner in this neighbourhood made the same compromises, that the enforcement was selective, that the hostel was safe enough, that the fire escape being blocked by Private Room 2 was a temporary arrangement that had lasted four years.

Felix had catalogued these violations the way a man catalogues ammunition -- carefully, completely, with the understanding that each round served a specific purpose and the magazine was full.

And then the final round: complicity. Two years of knowing about the trafficking network. Two years of accepting the premium rent. Two years of watching packages move through the neighbourhood and saying nothing, reporting nothing, intervening not at all. Two years during which Lena Ekström had been recruited, trained, deployed, arrested, and imprisoned, and Razak had known about every stage and had acted on none.

If he called Inspector Shah, Felix would counter-report. The building violations would generate an investigation. The tax evasion would generate an audit. And the complicity -- the knowledge of trafficking, the acceptance of premium rent, the silence -- would generate charges. Not drug trafficking charges, not the capital offence that faced Connor, but abetment charges, obstruction charges, the kind of charges that closed businesses and destroyed reputations and sent sixty-three-year-old men to prison for the remainder of their relevance.

Razak looked at the map. Sixty-three pins. Sixty-three stories of travelers who had died in places that should have been safe. He had collected them with the detachment of a historian, the careful distance of a man who studied catastrophe without participating in it. But the distance was gone now. The catastrophe was in his building. The catastrophe slept in Private Room 1 and drank coffee in his common room and had just demonstrated, with clinical precision, that the collector of dead backpackers was also, and had always been, a participant.

He opened his desk drawer. Inside, beneath the guest ledgers and the receipt books and the building insurance policy that was three months expired, there was a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label that he kept for emergencies. This qualified. He poured two fingers into a tea glass and drank it in one motion and felt the whisky burn a path from his throat to his stomach and the burning was the only honest sensation he'd felt all morning.

On the desk, his phone sat beside the rolled newspaper. Inspector Shah's number was in his contacts. It had been there for years, a safety measure, the emergency glass to break in case of fire. The glass was still intact. The fire was burning. And Razak could not break the glass because the glass, it turned out, was also the wall that kept his own house standing.

He poured another two fingers. He drank them. He looked at the map and found Malaysia and found Kuala Lumpur and found the approximate location of Petaling Street and imagined a pin -- red, small, definitive -- pushed into the paper at the exact point where his hostel stood.

The pin was not there yet. But the pin was coming. And Razak could see it with the clarity of a man who had spent seventeen years studying the pattern and was now, for the first time, inside it.

At 6:47 PM, the call to prayer from Masjid Jamek carried across the rooftops of Chinatown, and the city paused -- not stopping, never stopping, but modulating, the traffic dimming slightly, the market voices lowering, the great machine of KL acknowledging something larger than commerce for four minutes and thirty seconds before resuming.

Connor sat in the common room. Priya sat in the courtyard. Razak sat in his office. Three people in three rooms of the same building, separated by floors and walls and the particular loneliness of people who share a crisis but cannot share a solution.

Felix was not in the building. He had left at noon -- his leather sandals on the staircase, his linen shirt passing through the common room, his exit as smooth and unhurried as his entrance had been nine months ago. Where he went, no one asked. What he did, no one questioned. He would return. He always returned. The building was his, in every way that mattered except the deed.

In the dorm, Bed 7 held Connor's belongings: the backpack, the cracked iPhone, the blue travel towel, the copy of *The Beach*, the compass tattoo's echo in the braided leather bracelet on the bedpost. On the bed frame, Lena's name waited in the wood. On the mattress, the thin foam held the impression of two bodies -- Lena's and Connor's -- layered like geological strata, the Swedish girl and the Australian boy, different people separated by months and connected by the mechanism that had used them both.

The burner phone sat in Connor's pocket. The CCTV still sat in the burner phone's memory. The suitcase sat in a future that was approaching at the speed of Felix's schedule.

And somewhere in the building, Mama Siti moved through the kitchen in the particular silence of a woman who had stopped singing, and the silence was louder than any song, and the building heard it, and the building understood, because the building had been here before -- in 1943, when the Japanese used the second floor for purposes that left marks in the plaster, and in 1972, when the brothel's clients made sounds that the walls absorbed and never released, and in 2009, when Razak had opened the doors and hung the lanterns and believed that the building's history could be overwritten by hospitality.

The history could not be overwritten. The history was the building. And the building was patient, and the building was waiting, and the building knew -- the way old buildings in the tropics know things, through their damp walls and cracked tiles and settling foundations -- that the red pin was coming.

The ceiling fans turned.

The lanterns glowed.

And somewhere in Kuala Lumpur, a suitcase was being prepared.
