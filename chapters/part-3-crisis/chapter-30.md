# Chapter 30: The Suitcase

The last night.

Connor knew it was the last night the way bodies know things that minds refuse to articulate -- not as a thought but as a condition, a state of being, the cellular recognition of finality that preceded the conscious acknowledgement of it the way thunder preceded rain. The body knew. The body had known for days. The body had been preparing for the last night with the quiet, autonomous efficiency of a system shutting down non-essential processes, redirecting resources to the core, the biological equivalent of a building turning off its lights floor by floor as the occupants left.

Day 46. Evening. The sun was setting over Kuala Lumpur with the operatic excess that tropical cities produced -- the sky turning shades of orange and red and purple that would have been dismissed as oversaturated if they'd appeared in a photograph but were, in person, simply the sky doing what the sky did at three degrees north of the equator, the light bending through the atmospheric moisture and the particulate haze and the collective exhalation of eight million lives and producing, at the horizon, a colour that had no name in English but that the Malays called *senja*, which meant dusk, which meant the time between day and night, which meant the time when the world was neither one thing nor the other.

Connor was on the rooftop.

He had come up here because the rooftop was where the story had started -- the rooftop where Felix had stood against the railing on the first night, silhouetted against the Petronas Towers, and said *I could use someone reliable around here*. The rooftop where Connor had sat in a plastic chair and felt the warmth of Felix's attention and mistaken it for friendship. The rooftop where, six weeks ago, a man with a scar on his eyebrow and a linen shirt and a German accent had looked at a broke, lonely Australian backpacker and seen raw material.

The plastic chair was still here. Connor sat in it. The chair was damp with humidity, the same humidity that had been on it the first night, the humidity that was KL's constant companion, the moisture that lived in the air the way fish lived in water -- not as a visitor but as a resident, permanent, inseparable from the medium it occupied.

The Petronas Towers were lit. Twin silver columns against the darkening sky, connected by the skybridge at the forty-first floor, the entire structure performing its nightly transformation from architecture into icon, from building into symbol, from steel and glass into the thing that appeared on postcards and screensavers and the Instagram feeds of a million travellers who had photographed it and captioned it and moved on.

Connor had photographed the towers on his second night. The photo was still on his Instagram -- @ConnorGoesGlobal, the account with 4,200 followers that he hadn't posted to in ten days because posting required the maintenance of a fiction and the fiction had collapsed, the fiction being that he was a content creator on a gap year rather than a drug mule on a countdown. The photo showed the towers at night, lit silver, the sky behind them the deep blue of a KL evening, and the caption read: *These two beauties tho. KL is UNREAL. #PetronasTowers #KualaLumpur #BackpackerLife #LivingTheDream*

Living the dream. He had written that forty-four days ago. The dream was over. The waking was here.

---

At seven PM, Mama Siti appeared on the rooftop.

This was unusual. Mama Siti's domain was the kitchen. She moved between the ground floor and the kitchen the way planets moved in orbits -- predictable, gravitational, defined by a force that was not physical but operational, the force of a woman who had been cooking in the same kitchen for thirty years and had established a territory that extended from the stove to the prep counter to the wash area and no further. The rooftop was not her territory. The rooftop was the territory of guests, of Felix, of the evenings that belonged to the building's transient population rather than its permanent staff.

But Mama Siti was here. She had climbed three flights of stairs -- the narrow, steep staircase that made her knees ache, the staircase that she usually sent younger staff to navigate, the staircase that the building had not been designed for but had acquired during one of its many renovations, the addition of a rooftop access that turned the building's highest point into a social space. She had climbed the stairs and pushed open the door and stepped onto the rooftop and the effort was visible in her breathing, in the slight rise and fall of her chest, in the careful way she placed her feet on the uneven surface.

She carried a plate. The plate held nasi lemak.

Not the morning nasi lemak, which was the standard version -- the coconut rice, the sambal, the ikan bilis, the cucumber, the egg. This was a different version. This was the version that Mama Siti made for occasions, for visits from family, for the Hari Raya celebrations that she prepared with weeks of advance planning. The rice was cooked with extra pandan leaves, the fragrance richer, deeper. The sambal was the special sambal -- the one with fresh-ground chilli and dried shrimp and the particular sweetness that came from palm sugar rather than white sugar. The ikan bilis were fried crisp. The egg was a perfect half-moon of fried egg, the edges lacy, the yolk still soft.

She placed the plate on the zinc table beside Connor's chair. She didn't speak. She stood beside the table with her hands folded in front of her apron and looked at Connor with the expression that she had been wearing since Day 1, the expression that had been there behind every plate of nasi lemak and every proverb and every silence -- the expression of a woman who knew.

"Thank you, Mama Siti," Connor said.

She nodded. The nod was small, economical, the gesture of a woman who conserved movement the way she conserved ingredients -- nothing wasted, everything measured, the minimum necessary to convey the maximum meaning.

She sat on the zinc railing's ledge. Not the chair -- the ledge, which was lower, which brought her closer to the rooftop's surface, which was the posture of a woman who intended to stay.

Connor ate. The nasi lemak was extraordinary. The rice was fragrant, the sambal burned with a heat that was complex rather than aggressive, the ikan bilis were salt and crunch, the egg was perfect. He ate and the food was the best thing he had tasted in six weeks and the tasting was the first time in days that his senses had operated at full capacity, the flavour breaking through the numbness that had insulated him from the physical world since the rooftop conversation with Felix, since the numbers, since the truth.

He ate slowly. He ate the way people ate when the eating was not just nutrition but ceremony -- the way families ate at Christmas, the way friends ate at farewell dinners, the way the condemned ate their last meal, savouring each bite because the bites were countable and the count was low.

Mama Siti watched him eat. Her eyes were dark and still and the stillness was not emptiness but depth, the stillness of water that was very deep, the stillness that concealed rather than revealed.

When he finished, she took the plate. She held it on her lap, the empty plate, the plate that still carried the ghost of the food that had been on it, the residue of coconut oil and sambal and the fragrance that would linger on the ceramic for hours.

"Dulu," she said, "ada seorang budak perempuan." *Once, there was a girl.*

Connor looked at her. Mama Siti's voice was different from her kitchen voice -- not louder but softer, more intimate, the voice of a woman telling a story rather than giving an instruction, the voice that she used for proverbs and the voice that she used for truths and the distinction between the two was smaller than most people realised.

"Dia tinggal di kampung di Perak. She lived in a village in Perak. She was young. She was clever. She wanted to go to the city -- to KL, to the lights, to the life that the village could not give her."

She paused. The pause was part of the story -- the Malay storytelling tradition in which pauses were not absences but presences, the silence between sentences carrying as much meaning as the sentences themselves.

"She came to the city. She found work. She found a room. She found a man who told her she was special, who told her he could help her, who gave her money and attention and the feeling of belonging. The man asked her to carry things. Small things. Envelopes. Then packages. Then bigger packages. The girl carried them because the man had been kind and because the money was good and because she was young and because the young believe that the world is a place where kindness is kindness and money is money and carrying is just carrying."

Connor's chest tightened. The story was not about a girl in a village. The story was about him. The story was about Lena. The story was about every person who had ever been recruited by someone who understood the mechanics of loneliness and the engineering of trust.

"The girl was caught," Mama Siti said. "She was caught at a roadblock on the road to Ipoh. The police found what she was carrying. She was arrested. She was charged. The man who had told her she was special was not there. The man had never been there -- not truly, not in the way that *there* meant being present for the consequence and not just the cause."

She looked at Connor. The look was direct, unfiltered, the look of a woman who had abandoned the indirection of proverbs and the obliqueness of kitchen wisdom and was now speaking in the clear, simple language of a truth that could not be softened.

"The girl is my niece. She is in Kajang Prison. She has been there for four years. Her name is not Lena. Her name is Nurul. And I cook nasi lemak in this hostel because this hostel is where the man who recruited her operated, and I cook here because cooking here is the only way I can watch, and watching is the only way I can try to prevent what happened to Nurul from happening to the next person who sleeps in Bed 7."

The information detonated in Connor's mind. Mama Siti was not a cook. Mama Siti was not a fixture. Mama Siti was a woman whose niece had been destroyed by the same system that was destroying Connor, and the cooking and the proverbs and the silence were not the habits of an eccentric old woman but the surveillance of a woman who had stationed herself at the intersection of the network and the building and was watching, always watching, for the next face that would appear in the kitchen with that hollowed-out look, the eyes going flat, the mouth forgetting how to smile -- the face of a person being consumed by something they couldn't name.

"You've been watching me since Day 1," Connor said.

"Since before Day 1. Since Felix returned. Since I heard he was recruiting again. Since the bed -- your bed, Nurul's bed, Lena's bed -- was occupied by a young foreigner who was broke and lonely and exactly the kind of person Felix looks for."

"Why didn't you tell me? On Day 1. Why didn't you say *the man in the private room is a drug trafficker who will use you and discard you*?"

"I told you. In every way I knew how. The proverbs. The silences. The way I looked at you when you came back from a delivery. The nasi lemak that I made you every morning because the making was the caring and the caring was the warning and the warning was all I had because the direct warning -- the words, the statement, the *Felix is a drug trafficker* -- would have been met with the same response that every mule gives, which is denial, which is *you don't know what you're talking about*, which is the machine's first and strongest defence."

She was right. She was right and the rightness was crushing because it meant that the failure was not hers -- not the failure of a woman who had chosen proverbs over plain speech -- but his, the failure of a man who had received every warning in every form and had refused them all, had processed them through the machine and converted them from warnings into noise, from truth into nuisance, from the voices of people who cared about him into the voices of people who didn't understand.

"What should I do?" Connor said.

It was the question he had asked Priya on Day 39. It was the question he had asked himself in the train station. It was the question that had been sitting at the centre of his life for forty-six days, unanswered, because the question was not really a question -- it was a petition, a plea for someone to make the choice for him, to provide the force that would overcome the inertia, to push him through the door that he could see but could not walk through because walking required the activation of a will that the machine had neutralised.

Mama Siti stood. She was small -- five feet, maybe less -- and standing on the rooftop against the sky she looked smaller, a figure defined not by her height but by her density, the concentrated mass of a woman who had compressed thirty years of watching and cooking and waiting into a body that was small and indestructible.

"Pagi esok," she said. "Saya masak nasi lemak untuk kamu. Kalau kamu datang makan, saya tahu kamu masih hidup."

*Tomorrow morning. I will cook nasi lemak for you. If you come to eat, I will know you are still alive.*

She picked up the empty plate. She walked to the rooftop door. She opened it. She descended the staircase. Her footsteps were quiet -- quieter than a woman her age should have been on stairs that steep, the quiet of a woman who had been navigating this building for thirty years and knew every creak and every silence and the difference between the two.

The door closed. Connor was alone on the rooftop. The Petronas Towers watched. The city hummed. The last light was gone now, replaced by the orange glow of eight million lights reflected off the underside of clouds, the permanent false dawn that KL wore at night, the city's refusal to be dark.

---

He went downstairs at eight. The common room was occupied -- new guests, the rotating population of backpackers who arrived and departed with the regularity of tides, each one bringing a different accent and a different story and the same basic desire: to be somewhere else, to be someone else, to be free. A German couple was playing cards at the coffee table. An Australian girl -- young, maybe twenty, with a backpack that was too big and a smile that was too wide and a luminous, untested confidence -- the glow of a person who had never been afraid of anything because the world had not yet given her a reason -- was FaceTiming someone, her voice bright and loud in the common room's acoustic space.

Connor looked at the Australian girl. She looked like him. Not physically -- she was small and dark-haired and the resemblance was not in the features but in the posture, in the energy, in the way she occupied space with the casual ownership of a person who believed that the world was arranged for her benefit. She was the Connor of Day 1. She was the person he had been before the envelopes and the packages and the charger boxes and the suitcase. She was the person who walked past drug warning signs without reading them and changed the channel when documentaries about drug trafficking appeared on the hostel TV and kissed a woman to avoid answering a question about Malaysian law.

She was him. She was also, potentially, the next one. Felix's next recruit. Felix's next raw material. The next person to sit in a plastic chair on the rooftop and hear the words *I could use someone reliable* and feel the warmth of being chosen.

He wanted to say something to her. He wanted to walk across the common room and sit in the armchair next to hers and say: *Listen. There's a man on the third floor. He's German. He's charming. He'll buy you a beer and tell you stories and make you feel like the most interesting person in the room. And then he'll ask you to carry an envelope. Don't.*

He didn't say it. He didn't say it because saying it would have required explaining how he knew, and explaining how he knew would have required telling the story, and telling the story would have made it real in a way that was different from the way it was real inside his head, which was the only place where the story currently lived, the only place where the story existed in its full, devastating, unedited form.

He climbed the staircase to Dorm 3. The third step squeaked. The dorm was empty -- the Swedish couple and the Korean man were out, exploring, living, doing the things that travellers did in KL on a Friday evening.

Bed 7.

He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. The towel was cool against his skin, the microfiber smooth, the fabric that had been with him through twelve countries and was going to be with him through one more. The towel smelled of sunscreen and the faintly chemical scent of a fabric that had been washed in hostel sinks with hostel soap in seven different countries and had absorbed the olfactory history of his travels -- the salt of the Andaman Sea, the dust of Angkor Wat, the eucalyptus of a Blue Mountains campsite that felt like a different century.

He held the towel against his chest. The towel was the most constant thing in his life. More constant than the hostel, which changed every day -- new guests, new sounds, new configurations of bodies in bunks. More constant than his phone, which he'd cracked and replaced twice. More constant than Felix, who was a function not a person. More constant than Priya, who was gone. The towel was the one thing that had been with him from the beginning and would be with him at the end, and the towel didn't know and the towel didn't care because towels were objects and objects occupied the world without moral engagement, without the burden of choice, without the paralysis that choice produced in a man who had been given too many choices and made the wrong one every time.

He closed his eyes.

The two doors were still there. Dang Wangi and TBS. Ahmad and the bus. The badge and the suitcase.

He thought about Razak's plan. Go to Dang Wangi at seven AM. Ask for Ahmad. Tell everything. Tomoko's photographs would be sent to The Star. Mei Ling's records would be provided. Priya's letter would arrive from London as confirmation. The system would receive multiple inputs simultaneously -- witness testimony, photographic evidence, booking records, a letter from a medical student -- and the system would process the inputs and the output would be... what? An arrest. A charge. A trial. A cell. A sentence that might be death or might be life or might be something in between, depending on the judge, the lawyer, the evidence, the willingness of the system to distinguish between Connor Briggs the mule and Felix Decker the handler.

He thought about Felix's plan. Go to TBS at seven-fifteen AM. Pick up the suitcase at seven. Carry it downstairs. Get in the Grab. Ride to the terminal. Board the bus. Sit in seat 14A or whatever seat the ticket said. Watch KL recede through the rear window. Watch the palm oil plantations stream past. Watch the sky. Arrive in Penang. Deliver the suitcase. Receive RM10,000. Come home.

Come home. The phrase was obscene in its simplicity. *Come home* implied that there was a home to come to, that the hostel was a home, that the bed with LENA carved in the frame was a home, that the building that had been consuming him for six weeks was a place of return rather than a mechanism of destruction.

He opened his eyes. The ceiling fan turned. The blades cast moving shadows on the ceiling -- the shadows of the blades cutting through the ambient light from the air well, the shadows that had been his nightly companions since Day 1, the shadows that would be someone else's nightly companions tomorrow, whether he was on a bus to Penang or in a cell at Dang Wangi.

He reached for his phone. The real phone. He opened the keypad. He typed the number -- the number he'd memorised from the card, the number he'd called two nights ago from this bed, the number that had rung five times and gone to voicemail.

+60 3 2600 ####.

The number was on the screen. The green button waited. The cursor blinked.

He could press it. Right now. Ahmad might answer. Ahmad might be at his desk, working late, the way narcotics officers worked late because narcotics operations happened at night and the officers who tracked them kept the same hours. Ahmad might answer and listen and say *come in tomorrow morning, I'll be here, bring everything you have*. Ahmad might say the thing that would tip the balance, the thing that would provide the force that Connor's will could not generate on its own.

He pressed the button.

One ring. Two rings.

"Dang Wangi, Narcotics. Sergeant Ahmad."

The voice was real. Not voicemail. Not a recording. The voice was a man, awake, at his desk, answering his phone at eight forty-seven PM on a Friday evening because narcotics officers answered their phones because the phones were how the work came in.

Connor opened his mouth.

The silence lasted three seconds. Three seconds in which the connection was open and the signal travelled through the Malaysian telecommunications network from a phone in a hostel dorm in Chinatown to a phone on a desk at Dang Wangi district police headquarters, and in those three seconds the air carried nothing -- no words, no sound, just the electronic hum of an open line, the sound of a connection waiting to be used.

"Hello?" Ahmad said. "Siapa ni?"

Connor closed his mouth. The words were there -- the same words from two nights ago, the same words that had been assembled and ordered and ready. *My name is Connor Briggs. I'm Australian. I've been carrying methamphetamine.* The words were there and the words would not come because the words required air and the air required breathing and the breathing required the belief that the words would lead somewhere better than the silence, and Connor did not believe, could not believe, could not force his body to convert belief into breath and breath into words and words into the act that would save his life.

"Hello?" Ahmad said again.

Connor ended the call.

The phone went dark. The screen returned to the lock screen -- a photo of a sunset over the Andaman Sea, taken three months ago, in a life that had existed before this life, in a version of Connor Briggs that had not yet entered the Lantern Hostel and climbed the staircase and found Bed 7 and placed his hand on a dead woman's name.

He put the phone under his pillow. He put both phones under his pillow -- the real phone and the burner phone, the two identities, the two lives, the two devices that represented the two doors and the choice between them.

He pulled the blue towel over his chest. He closed his eyes. He did not sleep.

---

The call to prayer came at 5:32 AM.

The muezzin's voice from Masjid Jamek entered the air well and rose through the building's open centre and reached the second floor and the dorm and the bed where Connor Briggs lay with his eyes open and his hands flat on the mattress and his body in the raw, humming condition of a body that had not slept -- not tiredness but a different kind of wakefulness -- the wakefulness of a system that had been running all night, processing, calculating, arriving at a conclusion that the conscious mind had not yet been informed of because the conscious mind was the last to know, the last department to receive the memo, the last floor of the building to get the message that the building was on fire.

Day 47.

He got up. He showered. The shower was cold -- the hostel's hot water operated on a first-come basis and the first-come was hours ago, the Swedish couple, who showered at four AM for reasons that no one questioned because questioning other travellers' shower schedules was a violation of hostel etiquette. The cold water hit his skin and the skin contracted and the contraction was the body's response to temperature and the response was mechanical and the mechanics were the only things still functioning, the automatic processes that kept the body operational while the mind was elsewhere, in the space between the two doors, in the corridor that was no longer a corridor but a single point, the point of decision, the point where the two paths met and diverged and one went north and one went south and the man at the point had to choose.

He dressed. Clean clothes -- the last clean clothes from the rotation, the board shorts and the white T-shirt and the Birkenstocks that Priya had called "the most offensive shoes in Southeast Asia." He packed his daypack with the things he would need for the bus: water, his phone charger (the real one, not a Wei's special), his passport, the blue towel.

The blue towel.

He held it. The fabric was soft, familiar, the microfiber that had been his companion through twelve countries. He folded it carefully -- the same fold he always used, the fold that turned the rectangular towel into a compact square that fit in the side pocket of any bag. He placed it in the daypack. The towel was coming with him. The towel was always coming with him. The towel was the one decision that required no deliberation.

He looked at the bed. Bed 7. The thin mattress. The vinyl surface. The wooden frame. The name carved into the underside of the rail -- L-E-N-A -- the name that had been there when he arrived and would be there when he left and would be there when the next guest arrived and placed their hand on the wood without reading it, without knowing, without understanding that the wood was not just wood but testimony, not just a bed frame but a monument, not just letters but a woman who had been there and done this and was now in a cell in Kajang waiting for a verdict that everyone already knew.

He did not carve his name. He had thought about it -- in the air well, two nights ago, he had thought about CONNOR in the wood, five letters, the same length as LENA. But he didn't carve it. Carving would have been an act of acceptance, of resignation, of the belief that his story and Lena's story were the same story. They might be. They probably were. But the carving would have made it certain, and certainty was the one thing Connor Briggs had never permitted himself, the one thing the machine had never produced, because certainty -- in either direction, toward escape or toward doom -- would have required the machine to stop, and the machine stopping would have required Connor to act, and acting was the thing he could not do.

He left the dorm. He closed the door. He did not look back.

---

The staircase. The third step. The squeak.

The ground floor. The reception counter. Mei Ling was there -- early, earlier than usual, behind the desk with the old desktop computer and the stack of checkout forms and the guest register. She looked up when Connor descended. Their eyes met. Her eyes held the same information that Razak's eyes had held, that Mama Siti's eyes had held -- the information of knowledge, the information of complicity, the information of a building full of people who knew what was happening and were waiting to see which door he would walk through.

He turned left. Not right, toward the front door, toward the Grab that would take him to TBS. Left, toward the kitchen. Toward the smell of coconut rice and sambal and pandan. Toward the stove where a small woman in an apron was cooking nasi lemak at five forty-five AM because the cooking was the watching and the watching was the caring and the caring was the last thread connecting Connor Briggs to the world of people who wanted him to live.

Mama Siti was at her station. The stove was lit. The rice was steaming. The sambal was in the stone mortar, being ground with the pestle that she'd brought from Perak thirty years ago, the pestle that was smooth from use and stained with decades of chilli and shrimp paste and the accumulated chemistry of a lifetime of cooking.

She saw him. She stopped grinding. She looked at his face. She looked at his daypack. She looked at the Birkenstocks on his feet and the clean white T-shirt and the board shorts and the posture of a man who was not going to Dang Wangi, who was not going to Ahmad, who was going upstairs to the third floor to collect a black hard-shell suitcase with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in its lining and carry it downstairs and out the door and to a bus terminal and onto a bus and through a country that would kill him for what was in the suitcase's lining.

She knew. She read his body the way she read everything -- with the total, involuntary attention of a woman who had been reading bodies for thirty years, the way a doctor reads X-rays, the way a mechanic reads engine sounds, the way a cook reads the colour of oil to know when it was ready.

She served the nasi lemak. The plate came across the counter -- the banana leaf, the rice, the sambal, the ikan bilis, the egg, the cucumber. The complete breakfast. The ceremony.

Connor ate. He ate slowly. He ate the way he had eaten last night on the rooftop, with the attention that was owed to food that was made by a woman who was cooking not for a guest but for a person, not for a transaction but for a life, not for the RM15 that the meal cost but for the possibility that the meal might be the last thing she could give.

The nasi lemak was perfect. The rice was fragrant. The sambal burned. The ikan bilis were crisp. The egg was perfect. The cucumber was cool and clean, the green freshness cutting through the heat of the sambal, the contrast that made Malaysian food Malaysian food -- the heat and the cool, the spice and the sweet, the fire and the water, the things that existed only in relation to their opposites.

He finished. He placed the fork on the plate. He looked at Mama Siti.

"Terima kasih," he said. *Thank you.*

She took the plate. She held it. She did not place it in the wash area. She held it on the counter in front of her, the empty plate, the plate that was evidence that Connor had come and eaten and was still alive, the plate that was the answer to the question she had asked on the rooftop: *If you come to eat, I will know you are still alive.*

He was still alive. He was still alive, and the alive was about to change categories, from the alive of a man who was free to the alive of a man who was carrying, from the alive of possibility to the alive of consequence, from the alive that had options to the alive that had only one direction, which was forward, which was upstairs, which was the third floor, which was Felix's door, which was the suitcase.

"Jaga diri," Mama Siti said. *Take care of yourself.*

The words were the simplest words. The words were the words that mothers said and grandmothers said and the women who ran kitchens in hostels said to the young people who passed through their buildings, the words that were simultaneously the most common farewell and the most profound instruction, because *jaga diri* was not just *be careful* but *be guardian of yourself*, the imperative not just of caution but of self-preservation, the command to treat the self as something worth guarding.

Connor nodded. He turned. He walked to the staircase. He climbed.

Not down. Not out. Not to the Grab. Not to Dang Wangi. Not to Ahmad.

Up. To the third floor. To Felix's door.

The third step squeaked. The Japanese characters watched from under their paint. The second-floor landing passed. The third-floor corridor stretched ahead -- narrow, dim, the overhead light a single fluorescent tube that cast the flat blue-white light of places where beauty was irrelevant.

Felix's door was at the end of the corridor. The door was open.

Felix was inside. He was dressed -- the linen shirt, the chinos, the leather driving gloves. The gloves. The gloves that Connor had noticed and commented on and accepted and the accepting was the first act of the machine, the machine's first production, the conversion of the gloves from evidence into eczema, from truth into trivia.

The suitcase was on the bed. Black. Hard-shell. Mid-size. The suitcase that would fit in the luggage compartment of a Transnasional bus without attracting attention, the suitcase that looked like every other suitcase, the suitcase that was anonymous and lethal and waiting.

"Seven AM," Felix said. "Right on time."

Connor looked at the suitcase. The suitcase looked back. Not with eyes -- suitcases did not have eyes. But with the dense, gravitational presence of an object that contained a death sentence, the way a loaded weapon contained a death, the potential compressed into plastic and fabric and the four hundred and fifty grams of white crystalline substance that was sewn into the lining by hands that wore gloves.

"The Grab is downstairs in fifteen minutes," Felix said. "TBS. The bus is at eight. Seat 22B. The suitcase goes in the luggage compartment. You sit on the bus. You don't touch the suitcase until Penang."

Connor picked up the suitcase.

The suitcase was heavy. Not dramatically heavy -- not the weight of the red Deuter backpack, not the seven kilograms that had strained his shoulders on the walk to Sentul. The suitcase weighed approximately ten kilograms, which was the weight of the suitcase itself -- the shell, the lining, the zipper, the wheels, the telescopic handle -- plus the weight of the clothes that Felix had packed inside it as cover, a tourist's clothes, T-shirts and shorts and a toiletry bag, the fiction of a man travelling from KL to Penang for a holiday rather than a delivery. The methamphetamine, at four hundred and fifty grams, was less than half a kilogram. Less than a bag of sugar. Less than a bottle of water. The substance that would kill him weighed less than his laptop.

He held the suitcase by the handle. The handle was plastic, moulded, the kind that fit the hand with the ergonomic precision of mass production. The handle was warm -- not from use but from the room's ambient temperature, the heat of a third-floor room in a building without air conditioning in a city at three degrees north.

"Connor."

He looked at Felix.

Felix's expression was the expression he always wore -- the neutral, professional, faintly pleasant expression of a man conducting business. But beneath the expression, or perhaps projected onto it by Connor's newly acquired clarity, there was something else. Not warmth. Not cruelty. Something closer to recognition -- the recognition that one human gives another at the moment of a transaction that both know is final, the look that the handler gives the mule, the employer gives the worker, the system gives the component as the component is fed into the machine for the last time.

"Be safe," Felix said.

The words were identical to Mama Siti's. *Jaga diri. Be safe.* The same words, from two people, meaning opposite things. From Mama Siti, the words meant: *please live*. From Felix, the words meant: *please don't get caught*. The difference between the two meanings was the difference between love and utility, between a woman who cared whether Connor survived and a man who cared whether the delivery was completed.

Connor carried the suitcase out of Felix's room. He walked down the third-floor corridor. He reached the staircase.

He descended. Third floor to second floor. The landing. Dorm 3's door, closed, behind it the empty bed, the blue towel gone from the pillow, the name on the frame waiting for the next hand.

Second floor to first floor. The third step squeaked. The last squeak. The last time the staircase would announce Connor Briggs's passage through the building's vertical geography, the last time the old wood would register his weight and produce the sound that it had produced for every occupant since 1928, the sound that was not a squeak but a record, a tally mark, a count.

Ground floor. The common room. The kitchen. The reception counter where Mei Ling sat and watched and said nothing because everything she had to say had been said and the saying had not been enough and the not-enough was the hostel's tragedy -- the tragedy of a building full of warnings that were issued and ignored, the tragedy of a system designed to help that could not overcome the system designed to harm.

Connor walked past reception. Mei Ling looked at him. He looked at her. The look lasted one second. In the second, the information passed -- the suitcase, the direction, the decision, the failure. Mei Ling's face did not change. Her hands, flat on the reception counter, did not move. Only her eyes moved -- tracking Connor as he walked from the staircase to the front door, the brief traverse of the ground floor that was the building's final opportunity to hold him, to slow him, to produce one more creak or one more shadow or one more proverb that might, at the last possible moment, change the direction of the story.

The building did not produce anything. The building was silent. The building had done what it could -- the squeaking step, the red lanterns, the air well's breathing, the spaces where warnings lived. The building had been the medium through which Mama Siti and Mei Ling and Razak and the ghost of Lena had tried to reach Connor Briggs, and the building had failed, not because the building was inadequate but because the man was, not because the walls were too thick but because the denial was thicker, not because the building couldn't speak but because the man couldn't listen.

Connor pushed open the front door. The morning heat of Petaling Street hit him. The market vendors were setting up. The smell of fried dough and diesel and incense. The sound of the city waking -- engines, voices, the call to prayer fading into the morning's accumulated noise.

The Grab was at the kerb. A silver Proton Saga. Different driver. Same destination energy -- the patient, incurious expression of a man who drove people to bus stations every morning and didn't ask where they were going or what they were carrying.

Connor loaded the suitcase into the boot. The suitcase went in alongside the driver's emergency triangle and a bottle of water and a prayer bead tassel that hung from the boot's interior. The boot closed. The suitcase disappeared.

He got into the back seat. He closed the door. He put on his seatbelt. The driver pulled away from the kerb.

The Lantern Hostel receded in the rear window. The red lanterns. The pre-war facade. The narrow staircase behind the door. Mama Siti's kitchen. Bed 7. The name on the frame.

The hostel grew smaller. The hostel became the street. The street became the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood became the city. And in the boot of a silver Proton Saga, in a black hard-shell suitcase, four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine travelled through Kuala Lumpur's morning traffic toward Terminal Bersepadu Selatan, where a bus was waiting, and the bus was going to Penang, and Penang was five hours away, and between here and there was the North-South Expressway and the checkpoint that might have a dog.

The ceiling fan was still turning in Dorm 3. The name was still on the bed frame. The building was still breathing.

And the next part of the story -- the last part, the part that had been written in statute books and court records and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 and the name LENA carved in wood -- the next part had begun.
