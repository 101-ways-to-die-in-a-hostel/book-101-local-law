# Chapter 23: The Truth

The alarm on the burner phone went off at 7:15 AM, and Connor was already awake.

He had been awake since 4:47. He knew this because he had watched the time change on the cracked screen of his real phone -- the phone that connected him to Instagram, to his parents, to the curated fiction of @ConnorGoesGlobal -- and he had watched it the way a patient in a hospital watches the clock on the wall opposite their bed: not to track time but to confirm that time was still moving, that the world had not frozen in the configuration it had assumed on the rooftop two nights ago, that the seconds were still falling, one by one, into the void between what he had been and what he now was.

4:47. 4:48. 4:49.

The dorm was dark. The ceiling fan turned. Three other beds were occupied -- a Swedish couple in Beds 3 and 4 who had arrived yesterday and whose names Connor had already forgotten, and a Korean guy in Bed 1 who snored with a precision that suggested his respiratory system operated on a schedule. The air was warm and damp and smelled of damp wood and Tiger Balm and shared sleep gone stale -- the communal exhalation of strangers in a small room, the biochemistry of four bodies processing the night.

Bed 7. Connor's bed. The mattress that had been his for forty-one days. The thin foam under vinyl that his body had memorized, the way water memorizes the shape of whatever holds it. The blue travel towel was under his pillow -- the Sea to Summit microfiber that had been to twelve countries, that smelled faintly of sunscreen and the South China Sea, that he'd bought at a camping store in Melbourne four years ago when buying a travel towel had felt like the most adventurous thing he'd ever done.

He lay there and the truth lay with him.

That was the difference now. Before the rooftop -- before Felix's inventory, before the numbers, before the word *methamphetamine* was spoken aloud in Felix's precise, German-inflected English -- the truth had been something Connor kept in a separate room. A room with a door. A door with a lock. The machine had built the room and the door and the lock, and the machine had kept the truth contained, and the containment had allowed Connor to function -- to walk through KL with packages in his daypack and numbers in his phone and the distance between what he carried and what he knew maintained by the engineering of denial.

The room was gone. Felix had demolished it. The numbers were in the open now -- 50, 60, 200, 400, 600, 72 -- and the numbers didn't go back into the room because the room didn't exist anymore, and without the room, the numbers lived where Connor lived, in his conscious mind, in the space between his thoughts, in the air he breathed and the food he tasted and the water he drank. The numbers were permanent residents now. They had moved in and unpacked.

The call to prayer came at 5:32 from Masjid Jamek. The muezzin's voice threaded through the pre-dawn haze, through the air well, through the shuttered windows, into Dorm 3 where Connor Briggs lay on his back and listened to a summons to which he could not respond because the summons was for the faithful and he was not faithful to anything -- not to God, not to the law, not to Priya, not to himself.

He watched the ceiling fan turn. *Tick, tick, tick.* The blades were slightly warped and the wobble created a rhythm, a metronome for the sleepless, a clock that measured nothing but its own rotation.

At 7:15, the burner phone buzzed.

The message was from a number -- not a name, never a name, Felix's operational hygiene maintaining the distance between identity and instruction. The message read:

*Pickup at 9. Wei's. Charger box. Drop at Chow Kit, stall behind the wet market, Uncle Lim, blue awning. RM600. Use Grab.*

Connor read the message. His hands did not shake. This surprised him, the absence of the tremor -- a stillness that was not calm but its opposite, the stillness of a system that has moved beyond stress into a territory for which no physiological response exists, a flatness that the body produces when the mind has accepted something the body cannot process.

He was going to carry drugs today. Methamphetamine. Crystal meth. In a charger box from Wei's shop. To a stall in Chow Kit. For six hundred ringgit.

He knew this. He knew it with the full, terrible, luminous clarity of a man who has been told the truth by the man who trapped him, and the knowing was the thing that had changed, the knowing was the new variable, because the packages hadn't changed -- they were the same packages, the same weight, the same dimensions, the same vacuum-sealed contents -- but Connor had changed, and the change was that the distance between his hands and the truth was now zero.

He sat up in bed. Swung his legs over the side. His feet found the cracked encaustic tiles -- cool, slightly uneven, the original floor of a building that had been a merchant's home and a warehouse and a headquarters for men who interrogated other men and a gambling den and a brothel and was now a hostel, the latest use in a sequence of uses, each leaving its residue in the walls, the floors, the air. His feet knew this floor. His feet had walked this floor every morning for forty-one days, and the familiarity of the cool tile against his soles was the familiarity of a routine that had, until two days ago, felt like home.

He dressed. Board shorts -- the same ones, always the same ones, the uniform of the man he had been. A singlet that said BALI VIBES in faded letters across the chest. Flip-flops. The braided leather bracelet from the full moon party. The costume was the same. The actor inside it had been replaced.

Mama Siti was in the kitchen.

She was always in the kitchen. Connor had stopped questioning her hours, her permanence, the way she existed in the kitchen the way weather existed in the sky -- not as a presence but as a condition, an atmospheric fact. She was frying something. The wok was black and heavy and seasoned with decades of oil, and the thing she was frying was *ikan bilis* -- tiny dried anchovies that crackled and spat in the hot oil, their salt smell cutting through the morning's humidity like a blade through cloth.

"Morning," Connor said. The word came out flat. The breezy inflection that had been his default -- the upward lilt, the Australian warmth, the casual confidence that turned every greeting into an invitation -- was gone. What remained was the word itself, stripped of performance, a sound with no decoration.

Mama Siti looked at him. She looked at him the way she had been looking at him for weeks -- with an expression that was not pity and not judgement and not fear but something older than all three, something that lived in the eyes of people who had seen the pattern before and knew how the pattern ended.

"Nasi lemak?" she said.

"Yeah. Thanks."

She served it on a banana leaf. The rice was white and fragrant with coconut milk, the sambal was red and glistening, the anchovies were golden, the peanuts were toasted, the egg was fried with crispy edges, and the cucumber slices were cool and green. It was the same nasi lemak she made every morning, and it was perfect, and Connor looked at it and saw for the first time what it was -- not just food but a gift, a daily act of care from a woman who cooked for strangers in a building that consumed them, and the care was real and the consumption was also real and the nasi lemak existed at the intersection of the two, sustenance and farewell in the same banana leaf.

He ate. The sambal burned. The coconut rice was sweet. The egg was warm. He ate because his body required fuel and his body did not care about the truth -- his body operated on calories and hydration and sleep and the body's priorities were separate from the mind's crisis, the body a machine of a different order, a machine that would continue to function until something stopped it, a machine that had carried packages for five weeks without complaint because the body did not read the labels.

Mama Siti watched him eat. When he was finished, she took the banana leaf and said, in Malay, something he didn't understand. Her voice was quiet. The words were soft.

"Sorry?" Connor said.

She shook her head. "Nothing. Eat well today."

The way she said *today* -- with a weight, a specificity, as if today were different from other days, as if today required a different kind of eating, the eating of a man who did not know how many meals he had left -- stayed with Connor as he climbed the stairs to the second floor, as he brushed his teeth in the communal bathroom, as he looked at his face in the mirror and saw what Mama Siti had seen: a man who was already somewhere else, a man whose eyes had changed colour not literally but functionally, the light behind them dimmer, the focus different, the gaze of a person looking inward at a landscape that had been rearranged without his consent.

Wei's shop at nine. The bell above the door. The cramped interior with its archaeology of phone cases and charging cables and cracked screens. The smell of solder and dust and air that had gone flat, the stale-breath atmosphere of a room that never received direct sunlight.

Wei was behind the counter. He did not greet Connor. He had never greeted Connor. Greeting implied relationship, and their relationship was not the kind that warranted greeting -- it was transactional, functional, the relationship between a packaging facility and a delivery mechanism, each component performing its function without the ceremony of human connection.

He went to the back. He returned with a charger box. POWERMAX ULTRA FAST CHARGER -- USB-C/LIGHTNING -- 65W. Same brand. Same packaging. Same cellophane wrap. Same weight that was not the weight of a charger.

Connor took the box. He put it in his daypack -- the grey Osprey that had been to Vietnam and Cambodia and Bali and now carried methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur. The box settled next to his water bottle and his real phone and the copy of *The Beach* he was never going to read.

He left. The bell rang. The morning heat of Petaling Street met him at the door -- 31 degrees at nine fifteen, the humidity already at eighty percent, the air thick and wet, the sky white with haze, the city beginning its daily process of heating itself to the point of thunderstorm.

He walked toward Jalan Sultan. Past the market stalls that were setting up for the day -- the vendors unrolling tarps, stacking merchandise, hanging counterfeit bags and watches and shoes from hooks and ropes and the ingenuity of commerce. Past the Guan Di Temple, where incense smoke drifted through the open doors and the smell was sandalwood and ash and something older, the smell of five hundred years of prayer in a room built for prayer, the smoke carrying the petitions of the faithful into a sky that did not answer.

He walked and the daypack sat against his back, and the charger box was inside the daypack, and the methamphetamine was inside the charger box, and the truth was inside Connor, and the nesting was complete -- object inside object inside object inside the man who carried them all, a Russian doll of culpability, each layer smaller and harder and more concentrated than the last.

He ordered a Grab to Chow Kit. The app's interface was cheerful -- green and white, the little car icon moving toward his location, the driver's name (Hafiz, 4.8 stars, silver Myvi) appearing with the ETA (7 minutes). The normality of the app, its seamless integration into the fabric of daily life, its assumption that everyone who ordered a Grab was going somewhere ordinary for ordinary reasons -- this normality was the comedy and the horror, the two so intertwined that separating them would require a violence that neither genre could survive.

The car arrived. Connor got in. Rear seat, behind the driver. Daypack on his lap. The car smelled of vanilla air freshener and the faint chemical residue of the cleaning product Hafiz used on his seats. The radio was playing -- a Malay pop song, the singer's voice warm and rhythmic, the melody carrying the uncomplicated optimism of pop music, the belief that love was the biggest problem, that heartbreak was the worst thing, that a catchy chorus could contain the full range of human suffering.

"Chow Kit, ya?" Hafiz said, glancing in the rearview.

"Yeah, mate. Thanks."

The car pulled into traffic. Jalan Petaling to Jalan Sultan to Jalan Tun Perak. The city moved outside the windows -- motorcycles threading between cars, buses painted with advertisements for skin whitening cream and online casinos, pedestrians crossing against the light with the calm fatalism of people who had learned that traffic signals were suggestions rather than commands. A woman in a headscarf carrying a grocery bag. A group of construction workers in orange vests. A kid on a bicycle, no helmet, weaving through the cars with the invulnerability of youth.

Connor watched all of it and all of it was vivid and all of it was distant, the world behind glass, the glass of the car window and the glass of his own dissociation, the transparent barrier between a man who is present and a man who is somewhere else, a man who is sitting in the back of a silver Myvi with methamphetamine in his daypack and watching the city pass like a film he's already seen the ending of.

They turned onto Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman. The road was wider here, the shophouses giving way to larger buildings, the scale shifting from Chinatown's intimate compression to the broader, louder architecture of a commercial thoroughfare. Signs in Malay and Chinese and Tamil. Electronics shops with speakers blasting tinny music onto the pavement. Fabric stores with bolts of silk and cotton stacked in windows. The smell changed -- less incense, more diesel, less heritage, more commerce.

It was on Jalan TAR that the package tore.

---

Connor shifted the daypack on his lap. The movement was mundane -- a repositioning, the kind of unconscious physical adjustment that bodies make in confined spaces, the language of comfort in an uncomfortable seat. The daypack's main compartment was unzipped -- he'd left it open to access his water bottle -- and the shifting sent the contents sliding, the water bottle rolling against the charger box, the charger box pressing against the side of the bag, the cellophane wrap catching on the zip's teeth.

The sound was small. A crinkle. The particular sound of cellophane under tension, the plastic resisting and then not resisting, the wrap peeling away from the cardboard in a strip that was maybe two centimetres wide and four long. Not dramatic. Not a catastrophic failure. Just a small tear, a minor breach in the packaging's integrity, the kind of thing that would happen to any product in transit, the kind of thing that a customer would notice at home and shrug at and peel away and discard.

But the tear exposed the cardboard beneath the cellophane, and the cardboard was not intact.

The box had been opened and resealed. Connor could see it now -- the edge where the cardboard flap met the box's body, the line of adhesive that was not the factory's adhesive but something applied later, something thicker, more deliberate, the sealant of a second closure. The box had been opened to put something inside it and then closed to conceal what had been put inside, and the cellophane had been applied over the resealed box to restore the appearance of factory packaging, and the appearance had held until the zip's teeth had caught the wrap and peeled it back and revealed the seam.

Connor stared at the seam. The seam stared back.

His fingers moved. He did not decide to move them -- they moved the way a tongue moves toward a broken tooth, the compulsion of the body to investigate the thing it fears, to touch the damage, to confirm with the most sensitive instruments available -- the fingertips, the nerve endings, the million receptors per square centimetre of human skin -- that the damage is real.

His thumb pressed the cardboard flap. The adhesive was still tacky -- not fully cured, the glue applied recently, within hours. The flap lifted. Not much. A centimetre. Enough to create a gap between the flap and the box's body, a gap that admitted light and air and vision.

He looked inside.

The charger was there. The white plastic housing of a 65W USB-C/Lightning fast charger, exactly as depicted on the box's label. But the charger was lighter than it should have been because the charger had been hollowed out. The transformer, the voltage regulators, the circuit board -- the guts that gave a charger its weight and its function -- had been removed, and in their place was a plastic bag.

The bag was vacuum-sealed. The seal was professional -- tight, airless, the bag's plastic compressed against its contents the way cling film compresses against food, following every contour, every edge, every granular surface. The plastic was thick, industrial-grade, the kind used for long-term food storage or evidence preservation or the packaging of substances that needed to be protected from moisture and odour and the dogs that could smell what humans could not.

Through the plastic, Connor could see the contents.

White. Crystalline. Granular, but not uniformly -- some pieces were larger, some smaller, some the size of rock salt, some the size of coarse sugar. The crystals caught the light from the car window -- the white haze of a KL morning filtering through the Myvi's glass -- and refracted it, not brilliantly but dully, the way cheap glass refracts light, the way ice refracts light on a day when the ice is already melting. The substance was packed tight, compressed by the vacuum seal into a dense, flat rectangle that fit the charger housing with the precision of a component designed for the space, which it was -- not designed by an engineer but by Wei, at his stainless steel table, with his vacuum sealer and his scale and his boxes and his flat, expressionless face.

Methamphetamine.

The word formed in Connor's mind and the word was not new -- Felix had said it two nights ago on the rooftop, had said it with the banker's precision, had said it the way you say a product name in a quarterly review -- but the word on the rooftop had been abstract, linguistic, a signifier without a referent, a label for something Connor had not seen with his own eyes. Now the referent was in his hands. Now the label was attached to an object. Now the signifier and the signified were united, and the union was crystalline and white and weighed approximately seventy grams and was sitting in a hollowed-out charger box in a daypack on the lap of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in the back of a Grab on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a country that would sentence him to death for carrying it.

Connor closed the flap. His thumb pressed the adhesive. The flap resealed, not perfectly -- the cellophane was torn, the seam visible -- but enough to restore the box's silhouette, to return the charger to its disguise, to put the truth back inside the box even though the truth was now also outside the box, in Connor's mind, in his fingertips, in the chemical smell that had escaped the gap when the flap was open -- a faint, sharp, astringent smell, the smell of something that was not a charger and not phone accessories and not export documents but crystal methamphetamine, and the smell was in the car now, in the vanilla-scented air of Hafiz's silver Myvi, and the smell was real and the truth was real and the box was in Connor's lap and the panic arrived.

---

It began in his chest.

A tightening. Not pain -- not the crushing, cardiac pain of a heart attack, though his first thought was *heart attack* because his first thought was always the wrong thought, the thought that replaced the real threat with an imagined one, the machine's final gambit: *you're not having a panic attack because you're carrying methamphetamine through KL, you're having a heart attack, which is a medical emergency rather than a criminal one, and medical emergencies are treatable, which makes them preferable to criminal emergencies, which in this country are not.*

The tightening spread. From his chest to his throat. From his throat to his jaw. His jaw clenched -- the masseter muscles contracting involuntarily, the teeth grinding, the pressure building in his temples. His breathing changed. The exhales shortened. The inhales shallowed. The ratio between oxygen in and carbon dioxide out shifted, and the shift produced the first symptom: lightheadedness, the sensation of the world tilting, the car's interior rotating on an axis that was not the car's axis but Connor's vestibular system misfiring under the load of too much adrenaline in too small a body with too few exits.

His hands were sweating. The daypack's nylon was slick under his palms. He gripped it tighter and the gripping was counterproductive -- the tension in his hands fed the tension in his forearms which fed the tension in his shoulders which fed the tension in his chest which fed the tightening which fed the panic which fed the gripping. A loop. A circuit. The body's feedback mechanism running without a governor, each output becoming an input, each input amplifying the output, the system approaching resonance -- the frequency at which a bridge shakes itself apart, the frequency at which a wine glass shatters, the frequency at which a man in the back of a Grab begins to drown in air.

"You okay, boss?" Hafiz's voice came from the front seat, distant, the voice of a man on the other side of a wall.

"Fine." Connor's voice was strangled. The word came out compressed, the vowel squeezed, the consonants sharp, the sound of a man speaking through a closing aperture. "Just -- car sick. Bit car sick."

"Can open window," Hafiz said, and he pressed a button and the rear window hummed down and the air of Jalan TAR rushed in -- hot, diesel-scented, loud, the air of traffic and commerce and humanity, the air that ten million people breathed every day without thinking about what was in their lungs or their laps or their daypacks.

Connor breathed. The air helped. The air didn't help. The air was a variable that had no effect on the equation because the equation was not respiratory but existential -- the panic was not caused by insufficient oxygen but by the crystalline white substance in the charger box in the daypack on his lap, the substance his fingers had almost touched, the substance whose chemical smell was still in his nostrils, the substance that, if the police found it, would result in his arrest, his charge, his trial, his conviction, and -- under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 -- his death.

The traffic was moving slowly. The car crept. A bus beside them displayed an advertisement for a telecommunications company -- a young woman laughing, her hair perfect, her phone held aloft, the caption STAY CONNECTED in English and KEKAL TERHUBUNG in Malay. The woman in the advertisement was happy. The woman in the advertisement existed in a world where the worst thing that could happen was a dropped call.

Connor looked at the daypack. The charger box was inside. The methamphetamine was inside the charger box. The torn cellophane was a flaw in the disguise, a visible defect, and if anyone looked -- if Hafiz looked, if a police officer looked, if anyone at all looked at the box and noticed the tear and noticed the resealed flap and opened it and saw the vacuum-sealed bag and the white crystals -- it was over. Not metaphorically over. Literally over. Life over. The threshold was fifty grams and the box contained seventy and the margin between what he carried and what would kill him was twenty grams, the weight of four teaspoons, the weight of a letter, the weight of nothing, the weight of everything.

The panic reached its peak. The peak was a place where time stopped and the body's systems ran simultaneously -- the cardiovascular system hammering, the respiratory system gasping, the digestive system clenching, the endocrine system flooding, the nervous system firing on every channel -- and the convergence produced a moment of absolute, blinding clarity in which Connor Briggs saw himself as he was: a man in a car in a city in a country that would kill him, carrying a thing that would kill him, for a man who would kill him, because he had been too stupid and too proud and too lazy to learn the law of the place he had treated as a playground, and the playground had rules, and the rules had consequences, and the consequences were the only thing in the entire equation that did not care about his nationality, his passport, his parents, his Instagram, or his sincere belief that she'll be right.

She would not be right. She had never been right. *She'll be right* was the epitaph of a man who died of his own certainty.

The peak passed. Peaks always pass. The body cannot sustain maximum panic indefinitely -- the system regulates, the adrenaline metabolizes, the heart rate descends, not to normal but to a new baseline, a plateau of chronic fear that is livable in the way that chronic pain is livable, not comfortable but functional, the body adapting to a condition that the mind cannot resolve.

Connor sat in the Grab and breathed and the breathing slowed and the city continued and the car moved north toward Chow Kit and the daypack sat on his lap and the charger box was inside and the methamphetamine was inside the charger box and nothing had changed and everything had changed and the delivery was still happening because the delivery was always going to happen because Connor Briggs was not the kind of man who stopped.

He was the kind of man who continued.

---

Chow Kit was a different KL.

Not the heritage KL of Petaling Street, with its shophouses and temples and the warm nostalgia of Chinatown. Not the glossy KL of Bukit Bintang, with its malls and its neon and its aspirational consumerism. Chow Kit was the working KL, the underbelly KL, the KL that tourists were told to avoid after dark and that locals navigated with the casual wariness of people who knew their city's geography of risk.

The wet market was the centre of it. Hafiz dropped Connor at the edge -- the car couldn't penetrate the warren of stalls and narrow alleys that constituted the market's body, the organic sprawl of a commerce that had outgrown its boundaries and spilled into the streets, the pavements, the air.

"Here okay?" Hafiz said.

"Yeah. Cheers."

Connor got out. The daypack was on his back now. The charger box pressed against his spine through the bag's nylon, a pressure he had carried a hundred times before -- the pressure of a package, the weight of a delivery -- but the pressure was different now because the pressure had a name, and the name was methamphetamine, and the name changed the weight the way a diagnosis changes a symptom, not physically but ontologically, the thing becoming more real by being identified, the pain becoming sharper by being named.

The wet market hit him.

Sound first -- the roar of a hundred transactions happening simultaneously, vendors calling prices in Malay and Cantonese and Tamil, the thud of cleavers on wooden blocks, the splash of water from hoses washing the concrete floor, the hum of refrigeration units, the buzz of flies, the particular sonic density of a space where every surface is hard and every sound bounces.

Smell next -- and the smell was overwhelming. Fish, raw and absolute, the iodine-and-salt smell of marine life displayed on ice and wooden tables, their eyes milky, their gills still pink, their bodies glistening with the melt from the ice that was keeping them commercially viable. Prawns in plastic tubs, their antennae waving. Chickens hanging from hooks, plucked, pale, headless, their cavities dark. Offal in stainless steel trays -- liver, kidneys, tripe, heart -- the deep, iron smell of the internal, the biological reality that supermarkets conceal in plastic wrap and polystyrene.

And beneath the fish and the fowl and the offal, the other smell -- the floor, the water, the concrete saturated with decades of organic runoff, the archaeological strata of blood and scale and fat that no hose could fully remove, the smell of a place that processed life into death into food into waste, a place where the cycle was visible, unpackaged, honest.

Connor walked through it. He walked past a man cutting a whole tuna with a knife the length of his forearm, the blade moving through the flesh with the ease of practice, the pink meat separating cleanly, the blood thin and bright. He walked past a woman arranging limes in a pyramid, her hands quick and precise, the limes impossibly green against the grey concrete. He walked past a stall selling dried goods -- bags of dried shrimp, dried chillies, dried mushrooms, the concentrated essence of things, the water removed, the flavour concentrated, the shelf life extended into something approaching permanence.

The market was alive. The market was the most alive place in KL -- alive in the raw, biological, unsanitised sense, alive in the way that a body is alive when you cut it open and see the organs working, the blood moving, the system functioning in its fundamental, inelegant, magnificent way. The market was life without the filter. The market was the body of the city with its skin peeled back.

And Connor walked through it carrying methamphetamine.

The juxtaposition was the thing. The market sold food -- sustenance, nourishment, the raw materials of survival. The daypack carried poison -- crystalline, synthesised, the raw material of destruction. Both were products. Both had supply chains. Both had producers and distributors and consumers. Both were weighed on scales and priced by the gram. The symmetry was obscene and perfect, the dark comedy that the universe composed when it placed a drug mule in a food market, when it surrounded a man carrying death with the machinery of life.

He found the stall. Blue awning, behind the wet market, down an alley that smelled of drains and cooking oil. A man sat on a plastic stool beside a table stacked with boxes of dried goods. Uncle Lim. He was maybe sixty, thin, wearing a white singlet and cotton trousers and the expression of a man who had been sitting on that stool every morning for thirty years and would sit on it for thirty more, the expression of permanence, of rootedness, of a man whose place in the world was fixed while Connor's had been drifting since the day he left Melbourne.

Connor approached. The protocol was the same as always -- Felix's system, Felix's script, the lines that Connor delivered because the script required them.

"From Wei," Connor said.

Uncle Lim nodded. He extended a hand. Connor unzipped the daypack and removed the charger box. The torn cellophane. The resealed flap. The box that contained the charger housing that contained the vacuum-sealed bag that contained seventy grams of methamphetamine. He placed it in Uncle Lim's hand.

Uncle Lim looked at the box. He felt its weight. He turned it over once. Then he set it on the table, among the boxes of dried goods, where it was just another box, another product, another item in the inventory of a stall in a market in a city where commerce was so dense and so constant that a charger box on a table was invisible, camouflaged not by design but by context, the way a leaf is camouflaged on a forest floor.

The man reached into his pocket and produced a fold of ringgit. He counted. Connor counted with him, the ritual of payment, the exchange that made the transaction complete. Six hundred ringgit. Three hundred and twenty Malaysian dollars. Approximately one hundred and thirty US dollars. This was the price of carrying methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur -- one hundred and thirty dollars, the cost of three nights in a hostel, the cost of a nice dinner in Melbourne, the cost of the AirAsia ticket that had brought him here.

Connor took the money. Uncle Lim did not speak. Connor did not speak. The transaction was silent, as all of them were, the silence a protocol, an insulation, the absence of language as a defence against the language of the law, which would describe this transaction as *distribution* and *trafficking* and *capital offence*.

He walked back through the market. Past the fish and the chicken and the limes and the dried shrimp. Past the sound and the smell and the life. Back to the street. Back to the heat. Back to himself, though *himself* was a concept that had been so thoroughly hollowed out -- like the charger housing, emptied of its components, repurposed as a container for something it was never designed to hold -- that the concept no longer signified what it once had.

He stood on the pavement outside Chow Kit market. The morning sun was high now. The heat was absolute. His singlet was dark with sweat. His hands were empty -- the charger box was gone, the money was in his pocket, the daypack was light again, holding only his water bottle and his phone and the novel he would never read. His hands were empty and his hands were guilty and his hands had touched the torn cellophane and felt the edge of the vacuum-sealed bag and smelled the chemical sharpness of what was inside and the sensory evidence was in his skin now, in the oils of his fingertips, in the receptors of his nostrils, evidence that could not be deleted the way CCTV could not be deleted, evidence that was biological rather than digital, the body's own recording of what it had done.

---

He posted the photo at 11:47 AM.

He was sitting in the back of another Grab, heading south toward Petaling Street, the delivery complete, the money in his pocket, the panic metabolized into the low-grade nausea that was becoming his baseline. The Grab was stuck in traffic on Jalan Raja Laut. Through the window, the sky was doing something spectacular -- the pre-monsoon clouds building in the west, towering cumulus formations lit amber and gold by the sun, the kind of sky that social media was invented to capture, the kind of sky that made people stop and photograph and post and wait for the little hearts to accumulate.

Connor took the photo. The phone's camera captured the clouds, the buildings' silhouettes, the warm palette of a tropical sky doing what tropical skies do when the moisture content is high and the light is right. The photo was beautiful. The photo was the kind of photo that @ConnorGoesGlobal existed to produce -- evidence of a life lived in beautiful places, proof that leaving Melbourne had been the right choice, that the nomad path was the true path, that the 9-to-5 was a prison and the world was a gift.

He opened Instagram. He applied a filter -- the warm one, the one that added golden tones, the one that made everything look like a memory even as it was happening. He wrote a caption:

*Living my best life.*

Three words. Four syllables. Seven hashtags: #digitalnomad #kl #kualalumpur #sunset #livingmybestlife #travellife #noregrets.

He posted it. The photo went to his 4,200 followers -- the number he rounded up to "about five K" when people asked, the number that represented his audience, his community, his proof of relevance. The photo went to the grid, where it joined the other photos -- the hostel rooftop, the Petaling Street food, the Batu Caves selfie, the teh tarik latte art, the curated archive of a life that did not exist in the form the grid suggested.

The photo was a sunset. The reality was methamphetamine. The photo was *living my best life*. The reality was the charger box and the wet market and the panic attack in the back of a silver Myvi and the seventy grams and the fifty-gram threshold and the mandatory death penalty and the business card he still hadn't used and the burner phone he couldn't discard and the man on the rooftop who had told him the truth and the truth being worse than the lie because the lie had allowed him to function and the truth required him to choose and the choice he kept making was the wrong one.

*Living my best life.* Thirty-seven likes by the end of the hour. A comment from Jake: *Bro KL looks fire!* A comment from a stranger: *Goals.* A comment from his mother: *Beautiful sky sweetheart. Call me when you can xx.*

Connor stared at his mother's comment. The double x. The kisses. The shorthand of maternal love, compressed into two characters, posted under a photo taken by a man who had, forty-five minutes earlier, handed seventy grams of crystal methamphetamine to a man behind a wet market in exchange for six hundred ringgit.

He closed Instagram. He put the phone in his pocket. He looked out the window at the city that was beautiful and indifferent and would be here long after he was gone.

The Lantern Hostel was quiet when he returned.

The common room was empty. The TV was off. The ceiling fans turned in the amber light of the red lanterns. Mama Siti's kitchen was clean -- she had finished the morning service, the wok was hanging on its hook, the banana leaves were stacked, the sambal was covered in cling film. The air well admitted a column of white light that fell on the mosaic bench and lit the dust motes in the air, the microscopic debris of a building that was always, always shedding.

Connor climbed the stairs. First floor to second. The third step squeaked. The staircase walls were covered in stickers from travellers past -- BALI, CHIANG MAI, HANOI, SIEM REAP, the destinations of the circuit, the stamps of a community that moved through the world and left its mark in adhesive, in ink, in stories told on rooftops and in common rooms and in bunk beds at midnight.

He stopped at the second-floor landing. The bathroom door was ajar. He pushed it open.

The bathroom was small, tiled in white, the tiles cracked in places, the grout grey with tropical mould. A single shower stall with a curtain that didn't fully close. A sink with a mirror that was spotted with age. A squat toilet in the corner that no Western backpacker used voluntarily. The room smelled of damp and disinfectant and the faintly sweet rot of pipes in the tropics.

Connor stepped inside. He closed the door. He locked it -- the lock was a sliding bolt, brass, tarnished, the bolt fitting into a strike plate that was loose in its screws, the lock more psychological than physical, the privacy it provided more symbolic than structural.

He sat on the tile floor. The tiles were cool against his legs. The coolness was a relief -- the only physical relief available, the only sensation that was not contaminated by the morning's events.

He looked at his hands.

They were the same hands. The same size, the same shape, the same sun-bronzed colour, the same faded compass tattoo on the inner forearm -- the compass he'd gotten in Bali because he'd thought it meant something, thought it symbolised his commitment to wandering, to following no map, to letting the world guide him. The compass pointed in all four directions. The compass pointed nowhere. The compass was as lost as the man who wore it.

His hands. His fingertips. The whorls and ridges of his prints -- the same prints that were on CCTV at Wei's shop, on the charger box, on fourteen packages over five weeks, on the evidence that Felix had catalogued and stored and threatened to release. His fingerprints were the signatures he'd left on his own death warrant, signed and dated and filed, the bureaucracy of self-destruction, the paperwork of a man who had walked into a system that recorded everything and forgotten that the recordings existed.

His hands had touched the plastic. Through the torn cellophane, through the resealed flap, his fingertips had been centimetres from the vacuum-sealed bag, from the crystals inside, from the substance that was worth RM600 in his pocket and a death sentence on his record. He hadn't touched the crystals themselves -- the vacuum seal was intact, the barrier was there -- but the proximity was enough. The proximity was the truth made tactile, the truth made physical, the truth that had been abstract on the rooftop and was now in his hands, in the oils of his skin, in the chemical smell that he could still detect if he brought his fingers to his nose.

He did not bring his fingers to his nose.

He sat on the tile floor of the second-floor bathroom of The Lantern Hostel and looked at his hands and the hands looked back and the hands were the hands of a drug mule, the hands of a man who carried methamphetamine through Kuala Lumpur, and the man who owned the hands was twenty-seven years old and from Melbourne and had a compass tattoo and a mother who posted kisses under his sunset photos and a father who was a property developer and a sister who resented him and 4,200 Instagram followers and a bed in Dorm 3 and a blue towel under his pillow and a name scratched into his bed frame that he'd never read and a business card in his wallet he'd never used and a burner phone in his pocket he couldn't destroy and a life that was measured not in years remaining but in deliveries remaining, and the deliveries were counting down, and the countdown was approaching a number, and the number was one, and the one was a suitcase to Penang by bus, and the bus would pass through checkpoints, and the checkpoints had dogs, and the dogs could smell what he had carried, what he was carrying, what he would carry.

He sat. The bathroom was quiet. The pipes hummed. The water in the toilet moved slightly, the small, mysterious oscillation of still water in old plumbing, the building's circulatory system maintaining its own rhythm independent of the humans it housed.

On the wall of the shower stall, written in black marker, the handwriting angular and deliberate:

*@HostelReaper was here. Check-out is mandatory.*

Connor had seen it before. He'd photographed it once, early in his stay, thinking it was street art, thinking it was content, thinking it was the kind of edgy, mysterious thing that would perform well on Instagram. He hadn't posted it. He'd forgotten about it. Now he read it again and the words were different -- not different in their letters but different in their meaning, the way a sign that says DANGER is different when you're standing in the danger, the way a warning is different when the thing it warns about is happening.

*Check-out is mandatory.*

He stared at his hands. The hands that had touched the box. The hands that had handed it to Uncle Lim. The hands that had taken the money. The hands that would, in a few days, lift a suitcase full of methamphetamine onto a bus and carry it to Penang through a country that would kill him for carrying it.

He washed them. He turned on the tap and the water came, lukewarm as always -- the hostel's plumbing unable to produce anything fully hot or fully cold, the temperature a permanent compromise, the water of a building that had been built for commerce and requisitioned for war and abandoned and revived and was now housing the man it would lose. He washed his hands with the bar of soap that sat in the dish beside the sink, the soap that was communal, touched by every guest, diminishing with each use, the soap that was a record of every hand that had washed in this bathroom.

He washed and the water ran and the soap lathered and the lather was white and the white reminded him of the crystals and the crystals reminded him of the box and the box reminded him of Wei and Wei reminded him of Felix and Felix reminded him of the rooftop and the rooftop reminded him of the truth and the truth was that washing would not help, that the stain was not on his hands but in his history, that the evidence was not biological but digital, that the CCTV footage and the phone records and the bank transfers existed in servers and databases and systems that soap could not reach, that water could not dissolve, that his hands -- however many times he washed them -- could not undo.

He turned off the tap. He dried his hands on his shorts. He looked at his face in the mirror. The face was his -- the squint, the stubble, the sun-bleach, the face of @ConnorGoesGlobal, the face of a man living his best life. The face was the same face that was on the CCTV at Wei's shop. The face was the same face that Sergeant Ahmad had looked at during the checkpoint. The face was the same face that his mother had kissed goodbye at Tullamarine Airport four years ago, the face she saw on FaceTime every third Sunday, the face she would see on the news if this ended the way the numbers said it would end.

*Living my best life.*

He unlocked the bathroom door. He walked to Dorm 3. He lay on Bed 7. The ceiling fan turned above him. The blue towel was under his pillow. His hand, without thought, slid beneath the pillow and found the towel's familiar fabric -- soft, thin, microfiber, the texture of twelve countries and four years and a life that had been, until five weeks ago, merely aimless rather than fatal.

He held the towel. The towel held nothing. The ceiling fan turned. The red lanterns glowed. And Connor Briggs lay in his bed in the city that would kill him and waited for the next instruction, the next message, the next number on the burner phone, the next step in a sequence that was moving toward an ending he could see with the terrible clarity of a man who has been told the truth and found that the truth, unlike the lie, offered no comfort, no protection, no distance.

The lie had been a room with walls. The truth was a room without them. The truth was the open air, the full view, the panoramic vista of a life collapsing in real time, visible from every angle, unobstructed by the architecture of denial.

And the view, from here, was nothing but sky, and the sky was beautiful, and the sky did not care.
