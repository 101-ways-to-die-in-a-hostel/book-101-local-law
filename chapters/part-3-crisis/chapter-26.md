# Chapter 26: Countdown

Seven days.

Priya's flight to London departed in seven days, and the number had become a physical presence in the hostel -- not spoken aloud but felt, the way barometric pressure was felt, a weight in the air that changed the behaviour of everything beneath it. Seven days until the last person who loved Connor Briggs left the building, left the city, left the hemisphere. Seven days until the only voices that remained were the ones that wanted something from him.

Connor counted the days the way prisoners counted days, which was ironic in a way that was not funny, because the counting was preparation for a different kind of captivity, the kind that didn't have walls but had the same effect -- the narrowing of options, the elimination of movement, the slow compression of a life into a single corridor with a single door at the end.

Day 40. Six days to Priya's flight. Four days -- Felix had said "a few days" -- to the final job.

---

The hostel had changed.

Not physically -- the red lanterns still glowed, the ceiling fans still turned, Mama Siti still produced nasi lemak from the kitchen as though the coconut rice was a natural law rather than a recipe. The bookshelf still held its rotating library of abandoned novels. The TV still played to empty rooms. The building was the same building it had been since 1928, the same walls, the same tiles, the same Japanese characters under paint on the second-floor landing.

But the atmosphere had shifted. The hostel felt watched. Not by cameras -- though cameras were part of it, Wei's cameras, the silent electronic eyes that had recorded Connor's every pickup -- but by the building itself, by the accumulated weight of a structure that had held so many bodies and so many secrets that the holding had become a kind of attention. The staircase creaked differently. The air well's acoustics had changed, amplifying sounds that had previously been absorbed -- a door closing, a phone buzzing, footsteps on the third floor at hours when the third floor should have been silent.

Connor moved through the building like a man navigating a minefield. Every interaction was loaded. Mei Ling's glance when he passed reception -- was it the glance of a woman who knew, or the glance of a woman who suspected, or the glance of a woman who was simply doing her job? Aziz, fixing a light fitting in the corridor, his ex-cop eyes tracking Connor with the flat assessment of a man who had spent decades reading bodies for guilt -- what did Aziz see? What had Aziz always seen?

Mama Siti served nasi lemak in silence. The silence was not unusual -- Mama Siti's relationship with silence was the relationship of a woman who had said everything she needed to say and was now waiting for the world to catch up. But the silence felt different now. It felt like the silence of someone sitting vigil.

Connor ate. The rice was perfect. The sambal burned. He tasted nothing.

---

The days compressed.

Day 41. Five days to Priya's flight. Connor did not make a delivery. The schedule had been suspended -- Felix had told him the regular drops were on hold "while we prepare for the final job." The suspension should have been a relief. Instead, it was a void -- the absence of the routine exposing the anxiety beneath it, the way removing a bandage exposed the wound.

He spent the day with Priya. They went to the National Mosque -- Masjid Negara, its modernist geometry rising against the sky in blue and white, the star-shaped roof folding outward in sixteen points like something designed by an architect who had looked at the sky and decided to build an answer. The building was enormous and angular and somehow weightless, its lines clean in a way Connor associated with airports and hospitals -- the architecture of institutions that processed humans at scale -- but here the processing was different, the processing was vertical, aimed upward, and the scale was not bureaucratic but devotional. The reflecting pool outside held the mosque's inverted image with a stillness so complete that it seemed less like water than like a second building, a mirror mosque submerged just beneath the surface, waiting.

They removed their shoes at the entrance. Priya wrapped herself in a borrowed robe; Connor was given a purple robe that made him look, Priya said, like a "very confused wizard."

Inside, the mosque was vast and cool and silent. The prayer hall stretched before them, the carpet thick and soft, the dome above creating an acoustic space that turned whispers into echoes and echoes into something close to music. Light entered through geometric screens -- blue, green, gold -- and fell on the carpet in patterns that shifted as the sun moved, the kind of slow, celestial motion that reminded you that time existed at a scale far larger than a human life. The screens themselves were works of mathematical precision, the geometric lattice repeating in patterns that contained no figures, no faces, no images of the living world -- only shapes, only the pure abstraction of form arranged according to rules that predated the building by centuries. Octagons nested inside octagons. Stars radiated from invisible centres. The light that passed through the screens was not merely filtered but translated, converted from the raw equatorial blaze outside into something coded, ordered, a language of illumination that fell across the carpet and across the two of them in shapes that were exact and beautiful and indifferent to the chaos they carried inside their borrowed robes.

They sat on the carpet. They didn't speak. The mosque held them the way the temple had held Connor weeks ago -- with the quiet authority of a space designed for the dissolution of the ego, for the reminder that the self was small and the world was large and the distance between them was the space in which faith lived.

Connor felt something in his chest -- not the fear, not the tremor, but something older, something from before the packages and the phones and the machine. A feeling that had no name in the vocabulary he used, the vocabulary of *sick* and *legend* and *she'll be right*. In a different life, in a different version of himself, he might have called it sorrow. In this life, in this version, he called it nothing, because naming it would have required a capacity for self-examination that the past five weeks had eroded to nothing.

The mosque gave him what the machine could not: stillness. Not the false stillness of denial, not the anaesthetic stillness of deciding not to think, but the genuine article, the stillness of a space so large and so quiet and so indifferent to his particular suffering that the suffering, for a few minutes, became proportional. Small. A single human problem in a room built for the contemplation of the infinite. He breathed. The air smelled of nothing -- not the damp wood of the hostel, not the diesel of Petaling Street, not the chemical smell of Wei's shop. Clean air. Air that had been through the geometric screens and come out purified, reduced to its essential function: the keeping alive of the body.

Priya's hand found his. The jade bracelet was cool on his wrist. She was looking at the dome, at the light, at the patterns on the carpet, and her expression was the expression of a woman memorising something -- storing the details in a place where they could be retrieved later, when the original was no longer available.

"I don't want to leave you here," she said.

The words arrived softly, almost lost in the acoustic vastness of the prayer hall. Connor heard them. He let a breath pass before answering. In the pause, the light shifted on the carpet -- one of the geometric patterns elongating as the sun moved, the octagon stretching toward an oval, the mathematics of the screen interacting with the mathematics of the earth's rotation to produce a slow, silent deformation.

"I know."

"Come with me. London. We'll sort everything else from there."

Another pause. He looked at the dome. The dome looked back with the benign indifference of a structure that had sheltered thousands of people and their thousands of problems and had not solved any of them, because solving was not its function. Holding was its function. Containing.

"Felix has the footage. If I run, the footage goes to the police. I'm arrested at the airport, or at Heathrow, or the Malaysian police send a request to Interpol and I'm arrested in London. The footage follows me."

What he did not say: that he had considered it. That he had lain awake in Bed 7 and constructed the London escape in detail -- the Grab to KLIA, the ticket on AirAsia or Malaysia Airlines or anything with wings, the flight path northwest over the Indian Ocean, Priya beside him, her hand on his arm during turbulence, Heathrow's fluorescent corridors, the Tube to wherever she lived, a sofa, a cup of tea, the illusion of safety. He had built the entire fantasy and then he had dismantled it, piece by piece, because each piece depended on Felix not acting, and Felix always acted.

"You don't know that," she said.

"Felix knows that. Felix knows everything."

She held his hand tighter. The mosque was silent. The light moved on the carpet. A pattern that had been falling on Connor's knee migrated to the carpet beside him, leaving his leg in shadow, the warmth replaced by the ambient cool of the prayer hall. And two people sat on holy ground and discussed the mechanics of a trap with the quiet, exhausted precision of people who had tried everything and found everything insufficient.

Day 42. Four days.

Connor's phone buzzed. Not the burner -- the real phone. Instagram notification. He opened it.

@HostelReaper had posted a new photo.

The account -- the one he'd seen on his explore feed weeks ago, the one he'd photographed as graffiti on a Chinatown wall -- had posted an image. The image was a single bunk bed in a hostel dorm, shot from above, the mattress bare, a blue towel draped across the pillow. The composition was careful, almost beautiful -- the light falling through an air well onto the bed, the wood of the frame catching the glow, the towel vivid against the grey mattress.

The caption read: *Bed 7. Dorm 3. The Lantern Hostel, KL. Still warm. #LocalLaw #101Ways #CheckoutIsMandatory*

Connor stared at the photo. The photo was his bed. The exact bed he was sitting on. The photo had been taken from above -- from the upper bunk, or from a standing position beside the bed -- and the angle showed the bed frame, and the mattress, and the blue towel that was his blue towel, the Sea to Summit that had been with him through twelve countries.

The photo had been posted six hours ago. It had three likes. The account had no profile picture, no bio, no other posts except the one he'd seen before -- the backpack on a bus seat with the caption *Another one packed for the journey. #NoReturn*.

Someone had been in his dorm. Someone had photographed his bed. Someone knew his name, his hostel, his room, his bed number, and the colour of his towel.

Connor's hands were steady. This surprised him. The tremor that had been his constant companion since the back room at Wei's shop was absent. In its place was something else -- a stillness that was not calm but was the body's response to overload, the circuit-breaker tripping, the system shutting down non-essential functions to preserve the core.

He screenshot the post. He looked at the account again. @HostelReaper. No followers that mattered. No history that explained. Just two posts, both about death, both about hostels, both about the specific, personal details of someone's last days in a building designed for temporary occupancy.

He deleted the screenshot. He put the phone down. He looked at his bed -- the thin mattress, the vinyl surface, the wooden frame, the stickers on the bunk above. Everything was normal. Everything was exactly as it had been every morning for six weeks. And everything was different, because the bed was no longer just a bed. The bed was photographed, catalogued, posted to an account that tracked deaths in hostels the way Uncle Razak tracked deaths on his map, and the bed was his bed, and the towel was his towel, and the hashtag was #LocalLaw, and the local law said death.

---

Day 43. Three days.

He tried to be normal. He went to Grind Culture -- the café two blocks from the hostel, the one with the reclaimed-wood tables and the single-origin pour-over menu and the neon sign above the bar that read HUSTLE in cursive, because irony was dead and no one had told the sign. The café was full of the usual congregation: freelancers and digital nomads hunched over laptops, earbuds in, faces bathed in the blue glow of screens displaying spreadsheets and Slack channels and WordPress dashboards, each one a citizen of the borderless nation of people who had traded cubicles for cafés and called it liberation. Connor had been one of them, or had pretended to be one of them, which in the digital nomad economy amounted to the same thing.

He ordered the flat white. He opened his laptop. He stared at the Pacific Soul Retreats account and saw nothing -- the content, the captions, the scheduled posts, the entire infrastructure of his fake career dissolving into irrelevance the way sandcastles dissolved in tides. The cursor blinked on a draft caption for a Bali sunset he'd photographed three weeks ago. The caption read: *Golden hour hits different when your office is the world.* He stared at the words and the words stared back and neither of them had anything left to say to each other.

He texted his mother.

*Hey Mum. Just checking in. Everything's good here. KL is beautiful. Love you.*

She replied in four minutes.

*Hi darling! So glad to hear from you. Dad says hello. He's feeling much better. Megan is coming for dinner on Sunday -- wish you could be here. Are you eating well? Please call soon. Love Mum xxx*

Connor read the text. He read it again. He read it a third time, and on each reading the individual details landed separately, each one a small, precise blow to a part of him he had spent five weeks trying to anaesthetise. *Dad says hello* -- his father, David, the property developer who deposited two thousand dollars into Connor's account every month without being asked and without complaint, the man who had replaced "if you come home" with "when you come home" and whose quiet recalibration of that pronoun was the most heartbreaking thing Connor had ever failed to notice. *He's feeling much better* -- better from what? Connor didn't know. He hadn't asked. He hadn't called in three weeks and in those three weeks his father had been unwell and had recovered and Connor had known nothing about either event because knowing would have required calling and calling would have required being a person who called and he was not that person, he was the other kind, the kind who texted *everything's good* from a café in a city where everything was the opposite of good. *Megan is coming for dinner on Sunday* -- Megan, his sister, the accountant, the responsible one, the one who showed up, who called, who brought wine to Sunday dinner and sat in the chair Connor's absence had made permanently available. *Are you eating well?* -- the question every mother asked, the question that was never about food but about survival, about the body's continuation, about whether the child was maintaining the physical structure the mother had built and released into the world with the implicit understanding that the structure would be maintained.

Connor read the text a third time and on the third reading the words blurred and his eyes were wet and he was sitting in a hipster café in Kuala Lumpur crying over a text from his mother, the tears falling on the wooden table between the MacBook and the flat white, and the barista with the man-bun looked over and looked away with the practiced non-observation of a man who had seen emotions in cafés before and had decided that emotions were not his department. Around Connor, the freelancers typed and sipped and hustled, each one sealed inside their own narrative, and Connor cried in the middle of them the way a man bleeds in a crowd -- visibly, but without witnesses, because witnessing required looking and looking required caring and caring was not a feature of the co-working café experience.

He wiped his eyes. He typed: *Tell Dad I love him. Tell Megs too. I'll call Sunday. Promise.*

He would not call Sunday. By Sunday he would be on a bus to Penang, or in a cell at Dang Wangi, or somewhere in between, and the phone call to his mother -- the phone call he should have been making every week, the phone call she waited for and he avoided and the avoiding was the cruelest thing he'd ever done because it was the cruelest thing children did to parents: not hating them, not fighting them, but simply forgetting them, the slow, painless forgetting that was worse than any argument -- that phone call would not happen.

He closed the laptop. He left the café. He walked through Petaling Street in the afternoon heat and the heat was a wall and the wall was everywhere and the humidity sat on his skin like something applied, a second layer he could not remove. The market stalls were open on both sides of the covered street, the green tarpaulins overhead filtering the sun into a submarine murk, and the vendors called out in Cantonese and English and Malay -- *copy watch, you want?* and *best price, best price* -- and the smell was the usual Petaling Street amalgam of fried noodles and incense and diesel and the sweet, heavy rot of durian from the fruit stall near the corner. Tourists moved through the covered walkway in pairs and groups, photographing the red lanterns and the Chinese signage with the delighted absorption of people for whom this street was a spectacle and not, as it was for Connor, a corridor. He moved among them. He was indistinguishable from them -- another Westerner in board shorts, another body navigating the market, another pair of flip-flops on the cracked tile. And none of them knew. None of them could have guessed, looking at him, that the man brushing past their elbows was carrying inside his chest a secret that would horrify every one of them -- a secret about packages and suitcases and CCTV footage and a law that carried a sentence measured not in years but in the absence of years, the permanent subtraction of all future time. He walked through the crowd and the crowd parted and reformed around him and the city was beautiful and the city was killing him and the killing was so slow and so gentle that it felt, from certain angles, like living.

---

Day 44. Two days.

Felix texted the burner phone at seven AM.

*The job is in two days. Friday. Details tomorrow. Be ready.*

Connor read the message. The words were grey on the burner's cheap screen, the font small and sans-serif, and the physical sensation of reading them was not in his eyes but in his stomach -- a dropping, a hollowing, the body's recognition of finality arriving before the mind could process it. Two days. The phrase had the weight of a medical diagnosis, the kind delivered in a quiet room with a box of tissues on the desk. He deleted the message. He put the phone under his pillow, beside the blue towel that was always there now, the Sea to Summit that had been photographed by @HostelReaper, the towel that was no longer just a towel but an exhibit, a prop in someone else's narrative.

He lay in Bed 7 and stared at the ceiling and counted the hours.

Forty-eight hours. Two thousand eight hundred and eighty minutes. One hundred seventy-two thousand eight hundred seconds. Each one a unit of time in which he could act -- could call Ahmad, could go to the embassy, could walk to the airport and buy a ticket and leave. Each second was an exit. Each second was an opportunity. Each second ticked past and became the previous second and the opportunity closed and the next second arrived and the next opportunity opened and the next opportunity closed and the ticking was the ceiling fan and the ticking was the clock and the ticking was the countdown to something that could not be stopped because the only person who could stop it was the person who had decided, through five weeks of accumulated choices, not to stop it.

He got up. He showered. He ate breakfast. He moved through the day the way a ghost moves through a building -- present but not participating, visible but not substantial, occupying space without filling it.

Tomoko was in the common room. She was on the sofa with her laptop, typing with the focused velocity of a person transcribing something urgent, her fingers striking the keys in short, decisive bursts separated by pauses in which she stared at the screen and her lips moved slightly, testing a sentence before committing it. Her new camera -- a Sony, cheaper than the Nikon that Felix's associates had stolen, purchased with her own money at a shop in Low Yat Plaza -- sat on the cushion beside her, the lens cap off, the strap coiled. She had been shooting again. Whatever she had lost when the Nikon was taken, she had replaced -- not the images, those were gone, but the capacity to continue, the journalist's refusal to accept that a stolen camera was the end of the story.

She looked up when Connor passed. Their eyes met. She didn't speak. Her gaze moved across his face with the attention of a person cataloguing details -- the hollows under his eyes, the tension in his jaw, the way his hands hung at his sides with the loose, disconnected quality of limbs that had given up on purposeful motion. She was reading him the way she read a scene before photographing it: assessing the light, the composition, the story the arrangement of elements told without narration. And what she saw, Connor understood, was the thing she had been waiting to see since she first noticed Felix's hand on his shoulder in the common room weeks ago -- the final stage, the approach to the event that would complete the narrative she had been assembling in her laptop's files, the story of a backpacker who walked into a trap and was now standing at its centre, looking out.

Her expression was the expression of a woman who was writing a story and the story was nearly finished and the ending was the part she hadn't written yet because the ending hadn't happened yet but it was coming, it was two days away, and she could feel it the way journalists felt stories approaching completion -- the narrative weight, the gravitational pull of events toward their inevitable conclusion.

Connor looked away. He climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. The Japanese characters watched from under their paint. The building breathed.

In the late afternoon, when the light through the air well had shifted from white to amber and the call to prayer from Masjid Jamek had come and gone, Connor climbed to the rooftop. The plastic chairs were warm. The clothesline held a batik sarong and a pair of socks that belonged to no one he knew. And there, between the shophouse roofs and the tangle of electrical wires and the water tanks and the satellite dishes, the Petronas Towers stood in the distance, their steel surfaces catching the late sun, the skybridge connecting them at the forty-first floor like a clause linking two sentences in an argument about height and ambition and the human compulsion to build things that exceeded human scale.

He had seen the towers every day for six weeks. He had photographed them for Instagram. He had used them as a backdrop for the life he was performing. But he had never looked at them the way he looked at them now, which was the way a person looked at something they might not see again -- with an attention that was not aesthetic but archival, the eyes storing what the camera no longer mattered enough to capture. The towers were beautiful. The towers were indifferent. The towers would be there tomorrow and the day after and the year after and the decade after, and Connor would not be here for any of it, and the not-being-here was so close now that he could feel its texture, could feel the specific quality of a future in which this rooftop and these towers and this amber light existed without him in it.

He sat in the plastic chair until the sun dropped behind the buildings to the west and the towers' surfaces went from gold to grey to the beginning of their nightly illumination, and the heat did not relent but changed character, became heavier, wetter, the prelude to the thunderstorm that would arrive at nine and make the hostel's air well roar with rain.

He went downstairs. He lay in Bed 7. He put the pillow over the burner phone and the towel over the pillow and closed his eyes and did not sleep.

Two days.

The clock was ticking. The fan was turning. The name was on the bed frame. And somewhere in a private room on the third floor, Felix Decker was preparing a suitcase with 450 grams of methamphetamine in its lining, and the suitcase was the last thing Connor Briggs would carry, and the carrying would take less than a day, and the day would be the last day of the life he knew, and the life he knew was already ending, had been ending since the first envelope, had been ending since the common room and the beer and the German accent and the smile, and the ending was coming, and the ending was not an ending but a door, and the door opened onto a room, and the room was small and grey and had bars on the front and a fluorescent light that never turned off, and the room was waiting.

Two days.

The ceiling fan turned.

*Tick, tick, tick.*
