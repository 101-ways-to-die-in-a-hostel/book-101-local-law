# Chapter 28: Priya Leaves

The suitcase was red.

Not the red of the Deuter backpack Connor had carried to Sentul -- that was a functional red, a hiking red, the red of adventure brands and departure lounges and the curated outdoorsiness of people who wore technical fabrics to brunch. Priya's suitcase was a different red. A deep, warm, almost-burgundy red that she'd bought at a Selfridges sale in her first year at King's College because it was the only suitcase in the store that didn't look like it belonged to a banker or a retired person. The suitcase had been to seven countries. It had a dent on the left corner from a baggage handler in Istanbul and a scratch across the front from a tuk-tuk in Colombo and a sticker on the back that said FRAGILE in three languages, which Priya had stuck there as a joke because she was the least fragile person Connor had ever met.

The suitcase stood in the common room at seven AM on Day 46, and the suitcase was leaving, and the woman who owned the suitcase was leaving, and the leaving was the last act of a story that had started five weeks ago at a hawker stall when a British-Indian medical student had looked at an Australian backpacker over a plate of char kway teow and seen something worth saving.

The saving had failed. The suitcase was proof.

---

Priya came down the staircase at seven fifteen. She was wearing the white dress again -- the cotton one, the light one, the dress she'd worn to the Bird Park. Her hair was braided. Her glasses were clean. The jade bracelet was on her wrist. She carried her daypack over one shoulder and her Lonely Planet Malaysia in her hand, the guidebook that had been her companion and her weapon and her futile shield against the country's capacity to destroy the people she loved.

She saw Connor and she stopped.

He was sitting on the common room sofa. He had been sitting there since five AM, since the call to prayer had reached through the air well and found him already awake, already dressed, already occupying the posture of a man who was waiting for something he didn't want to arrive. He wore his least-dirty clothes -- the board shorts with the frayed hem and the grey T-shirt that Priya had once said made him look almost respectable, which was the most generous thing anyone had ever said about his wardrobe.

"Hi," she said.

"Hi."

The word was insufficient. The word was always insufficient when it was carrying weight it wasn't designed for -- the weight of goodbye, the weight of failure, the weight of two people standing in a hostel common room at seven in the morning with a red suitcase between them and a flight at eleven thirty and a gap between them that was not geographical but moral, not about distance but about the choice that one of them had made and the other could not accept.

Priya set her daypack on the sofa. She sat beside Connor. She did not touch him. The not-touching was deliberate, a restraint, the physical expression of a decision she'd made during the night -- a night she'd spent in Dorm 4, awake, staring at the underside of the bunk above her, running the calculation one final time: the calculation of what she could save and what she could not, the calculation that every person who loved an addict eventually performed, except Connor's addiction wasn't chemical but structural, wasn't substance but system, wasn't a drug but a man named Felix who dispensed compliance the way dealers dispensed product.

"Your flight's at eleven thirty," Connor said.

"Eleven thirty."

"You should leave by nine. Traffic to KLIA2 can be--"

"Connor."

He stopped. The name -- his name, in her voice, with the particular emphasis she gave to the second syllable, the stress that turned the name from an Australian monosyllable into something that carried the melodic weight of her South London accent -- the name stopped him the way it always stopped him, because the name in her voice was the sound of being known, and being known was the thing he needed most and feared most and had spent five weeks running from because being known meant being seen and being seen meant being seen clearly and clarity was fatal.

"I'm not going to ask you again," Priya said.

"I know."

"I've asked you fourteen times. Different words, different moments, different arguments. Fourteen times I've said *come with me* or *stop* or *call Ahmad* or *leave tonight*. Fourteen times."

"I know."

"You always say *I know*. That's the worst part. You know. You've always known. Knowing has never been the problem."

The common room was quiet. The ceiling fans turned. Through the kitchen doorway, Mama Siti was visible at her station, the morning's nasi lemak already underway, the coconut rice steaming, the sambal simmering. Mama Siti glanced toward the common room, toward Priya and Connor on the sofa, and her expression was the expression of a woman who had seen this before -- not the specific configuration but the general shape, the geometry of departure, the angle at which one person leaned toward another person who was about to become a former person, a used-to-be person, a person who existed only in photographs and the subjunctive tense.

"There's something I need to tell you," Priya said. "And I need you to listen. Actually listen. Not the thing you do where your face listens and your mind is somewhere else."

"I'm listening."

She took a breath. The breath was visible -- her chest rising under the white cotton, the expansion of a body preparing to deliver something heavy, the physical mechanics of courage.

"I wrote a letter. Last night. To Sergeant Ahmad. Dang Wangi District Police, Narcotics Division. I wrote everything I know. Your name. Felix's name. Wei's shop. The schedule. The charger boxes. The Sentul warehouse. The deliveries. The amounts you've carried. Everything."

Connor's body went cold. Not the cold of the air conditioning -- the hostel didn't have air conditioning -- but the internal cold of adrenaline, the chemical winter that the body produced when threat arrived not as a sound or a sight but as information, as words, as the quiet voice of a woman he loved telling him she had committed the act that would end his life.

"You didn't," he said.

"I wrote it. I haven't sent it. The letter is in my bag. I'm going to send it from London."

"Priya--"

"From London. Where I'll be safe. Where Felix can't reach me. Where I can send the letter to Ahmad and to the Australian Embassy and to the editor of The Star newspaper and to every contact I have who might be able to do something, and I'll be in a country where the worst that happens is deportation, not execution."

She said the words with the clinical precision of a plan that had been constructed in the dark, hour by hour, during a sleepless night in Dorm 4. The plan was clear. The plan was logical. The plan was the plan of a woman who had tried love and tried argument and tried tears and tried silence and had found all of them insufficient and had arrived, finally, at the last available instrument: action without permission.

"If you send that letter, I'm dead," Connor said.

"If I don't send that letter, you're dead."

"Felix has the footage. The CCTV. My fingerprints. If the police come, the footage surfaces, and I'm--"

"You're arrested. Yes. You're charged. Yes. You face trial. Yes. And the trial is the only place where you might survive, Connor. The trial is where a lawyer can argue that you were coerced, that you were recruited, that you were a mule and not a dealer. The trial is where Ahmad's evidence -- Felix, Wei, the network -- might shift the charge from trafficking to possession. The trial is where fifty grams becomes a question rather than an answer."

She had researched this. The precision of her language -- the legal vocabulary, the distinction between trafficking and possession, the reference to Section 39B's presumption clause -- was not improvised. She had spent hours on her laptop in Dorm 4, searching Malaysian legal databases, reading human rights reports, studying the cases of foreigners arrested for drug trafficking who had cooperated with authorities and received reduced sentences. She had found cases where mules who testified against networks had been charged with possession rather than trafficking. She had found the numbers: possession carried a maximum of life imprisonment. Trafficking carried a minimum of death.

The gap between life and death was the gap between cooperation and silence. The gap was the letter in her bag.

"I need time," Connor said.

"You've had time. You've had forty-six days. Time isn't what you need. Time is what Felix needs. Every day you wait is a day Felix uses to prepare the final job. Every day you wait is a day closer to the suitcase and the bus and the checkpoint that you know -- you *know*, Connor -- is coming."

"The job is today. Felix said--"

"I know what Felix said. That's why I'm telling you now. Before the job. Before the suitcase. Before you get on a bus with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in the lining and drive through a country that will execute you for carrying it."

She knew the weight. She knew the amount. The specificity of the number -- four hundred and fifty grams -- was not a guess. Priya had calculated it from what Connor had told her, from the escalation pattern, from the amounts he'd described carrying in packages and backpacks, from the logic of a final job that was bigger than all the others. She had done the math. The math said death.

Connor looked at the red suitcase. The suitcase that was going to London. The suitcase that contained clothes and books and toiletries and a letter that held his life in its paragraphs, a letter that could save him or destroy him depending on variables he could not control -- the honesty of Ahmad, the corruption of the system, the willingness of a Malaysian court to distinguish between a mule and a dealer.

"Send the letter," he said.

The words came from somewhere he didn't recognize -- somewhere beneath the machine, beneath the fear, beneath the five weeks of accumulated denial and rationalisation that had converted him from a tourist into a defendant. The words came from the part of Connor Briggs that still existed, the part that his mother would recognize, the part that had said *okay* in the common room on Day 39 before the burner phone buzzed and Felix's summons pulled him upstairs.

Priya's eyes filled. Not dramatically -- not the cinematic weeping of a farewell scene, not the tears that actors produced on cue. This was different. This was the slow, quiet overflow of a woman who had been holding her breath for five weeks and had just been given, in two words, the permission to exhale.

"You mean it," she said.

"Send the letter. From London. To Ahmad, to the embassy, to everyone. And I'll--"

He stopped. The sentence had a second half and the second half required a commitment and the commitment required a decision about what he would do between now and the letter's arrival, between this morning and the afternoon when Priya would land at Heathrow and open her laptop and press send.

"And you'll what?" Priya said.

"I'll wait. I won't do the job. I'll tell Felix I'm sick, or I've left, or-- I'll find a reason. I'll stall. Until Ahmad comes."

"Connor, if you're here when the letter arrives, Felix will know. Felix will know because the police will come and Felix has eyes everywhere and the interval between the letter arriving and the police acting is the interval in which Felix decides what to do with you."

"Where else would I go?"

"The Australian Embassy. Go today. Walk in. Tell them everything. They can't protect you from Malaysian law but they can ensure you're in custody when the letter arrives, not at the hostel where Felix--"

"The embassy will call the police. The police will arrest me. I'll be in a cell within hours."

"You'll be in a cell where Sergeant Ahmad knows your name and your story and your willingness to cooperate. Not a cell where Felix's contacts can reach you. There's a difference."

The difference was the letter. The difference was whether Connor entered the system as a cooperating witness or as a caught mule. The difference was the distinction between walking into a police station and being dragged out of a bus. The difference was survival.

Connor looked at Priya. She looked at him. The common room was filling with morning light -- the amber glow of the red lanterns replaced by the blue-white of tropical dawn, the light that came through the air well and hit the mosaic tiles and scattered in patterns that moved as the sun moved, the slow celestial clock that measured something larger than human choice.

"Okay," he said. Again. The word he'd said on Day 39 and failed to honour. The word that was simultaneously the easiest and hardest word in the English language -- easy to pronounce, hard to mean.

Priya took his hand. The jade bracelet clinked against the bones of his wrist. Her skin was warm. Her grip was strong -- the grip of a woman who had been holding on for five weeks and was about to let go and the letting go required the belief that the holding had accomplished something, that the effort had not been wasted, that the man whose hand she held would, this time, do the thing he said he would do.

"I love you," she said.

"I love you."

"Then survive. That's all I'm asking. Survive this."

---

Mama Siti appeared in the kitchen doorway. She carried two plates of nasi lemak -- the banana leaf wrapping, the coconut rice, the sambal, the ikan bilis, the slice of hard-boiled egg and the slice of cucumber, the complete breakfast of a country that understood that mornings required sustenance and that sustenance was not just calories but ceremony.

She placed the plates on the counter without speaking. Then she looked at Priya. She looked at the red suitcase. She looked at Connor.

"Makan dulu," she said. *Eat first.*

They ate. The nasi lemak was perfect. The sambal burned. The rice was fragrant with coconut and pandan. They ate in the silence of two people performing a normal act on an abnormal morning, the normalcy of the food a temporary shelter from the conversation that had preceded it and the departure that would follow.

Mama Siti watched from the kitchen. Her face was still. Her eyes moved between Priya and Connor with the slow deliberation of a woman reading a text in a language she'd learned decades ago, the language of farewell, the language that the hostel had taught her through ninety-seven years of arrivals and departures, the language that said: *this one is leaving and the other one is staying and the staying is the dangerous part*.

She spoke once, to Priya, as Priya carried her empty plate to the wash area.

"Dia masih ada masa," she said. *He still has time.*

Priya looked at Mama Siti. Mama Siti's expression was unchanged -- the worn geography of her face, the deep lines around her eyes, the mouth that dispensed proverbs and nasi lemak with equal precision. But her eyes held something that her face did not express. Not hope exactly. Something harder. Something closer to the word for the belief that a story might end differently than you expected it to, the belief that the building might release one of its guests instead of keeping them.

"Terima kasih," Priya said. *Thank you.*

Mama Siti nodded. She turned back to her stove. The wok hissed. The morning continued.

---

At eight forty-five, Mei Ling called a Grab to KLIA2.

The car arrived at eight fifty-three -- a silver Proton Saga, the driver a Malay man in his fifties who had the patient, incurious expression of a man who drove people to airports every morning and had long ago stopped wondering where they were going or why they looked the way they looked. He loaded Priya's suitcase into the boot. The red suitcase disappeared into the car's interior, and with it, the letter.

Connor stood on the pavement outside the Lantern Hostel. Petaling Street was awakening -- the vendors setting up their stalls, the morning market taking shape in its daily configuration of canvas and trestle and merchandise. The street smelled of fried dough and diesel and the chemical sweetness of the durian stall three doors down that was already unpacking its thorned cargo for the day's trade.

Priya stood in front of him. They were on the pavement where he had arrived forty-six days ago, dragging his own bag from the KTM station, looking up at the red lanterns and the pre-war facade and thinking *this'll do for a week*. The pavement where he had entered this story. The pavement where Priya was exiting it.

"The embassy," she said. "Today. Promise me."

"I promise."

"Not like last time. Not *five minutes* and then the rooftop. Today. Now. After I leave, you walk to the embassy and you--"

"I promise, Priya."

She searched his face. She searched it the way she searched diagnostic scans -- methodically, looking for the signs that indicated truth or its absence, the microexpressions that the face produced when the mouth and the mind were not in agreement. She was a medical student. She knew how to read bodies. She had been reading Connor's body for five weeks, and the reading had been consistent: the body said one thing and the person said another, and the gap between the body's truth and the person's words was the gap that Felix exploited, that the machine maintained, that the denial required.

This morning, the gap was smaller. Not closed -- the gap might never close, might be a permanent feature of Connor Briggs's architecture, the structural flaw in the building that could not be repaired but only reinforced. But the gap was smaller. The words and the body were closer to alignment than they had been at any point since Day 6, since the first envelope, since the beginning of the long walk into the forest.

"I believe you," she said.

She believed him the way a doctor believed a patient who said they'd take their medication. Not with certainty. Not with the trust that comes from evidence. But with the qualified, hopeful, professionally calibrated belief of a person who had done everything in her power and was now transferring the outcome to the patient, the way all caregivers eventually transferred the outcome, the way all people who loved people eventually stepped back and let the loved one choose.

She kissed him. The kiss was long. The kiss was the kind of kiss that people gave at airports and train stations and hospital beds and any place where departure was real and the return was uncertain. The kiss compressed everything -- every hawker stall, every night market, every rooftop sunset, every argument, every morning, every conversation about the law she'd printed and the card he hadn't used and the life they might have had if the variables had been different, if the hostel had been different, if the man in the common room had been a photographer instead of a handler.

The kiss ended.

Priya got into the Grab. The door closed. The window was down and she looked at Connor through the opening and her eyes were wet and her face was the face of a woman who was leaving a burning building because staying would kill her too and the leaving was not abandonment but survival and survival was the thing she had asked Connor to choose and the asking was the last thing she could do.

"Embassy," she said. One word. The word was a command and a prayer and a diagnosis all at once.

The car pulled away. The Proton Saga joined the morning traffic on Petaling Street, threading between the market stalls and the delivery vans and the motorcycles, the red suitcase in the boot growing smaller as the car moved away, and Priya's face in the window growing smaller, and the hand she raised growing smaller, and then the car turned onto Jalan Sultan and was gone.

Connor stood on the pavement. The vendors worked around him. A man carrying a box of counterfeit handbags brushed past. A motorcycle horn blared. The durian stall's fragrance intensified as the morning heat began its work.

He was alone.

Not alone the way he'd been alone in the first week, when aloneness was a choice and a pose, the solitary traveler performing his solitude for an imagined audience. This aloneness was different. This was the aloneness of a man who had been stripped of everyone who might save him -- Priya gone to London, Jake gone to Langkawi, Tomoko's camera stolen, Ahmad's phone ringing to voicemail, his parents in a kitchen in Hawthorn that might as well have been on a different planet. This aloneness was structural. This aloneness was the building's gift, the hostel's contribution to the project of isolation that Felix had been engineering since the first evening in the common room.

He stood on the pavement for three minutes. Three minutes in which the morning moved around him and the city continued and the choice was still available -- the embassy was seven kilometres away, a thirty-minute Grab ride, a walk through security, a conversation with a consular official who would listen and act and connect him to Ahmad and to the system that might, if Priya's research was correct, distinguish between a mule and a dealer, between fifty grams and four hundred and fifty grams, between death and life.

The embassy was available. The embassy was open. The embassy was waiting.

Connor turned and walked back into the Lantern Hostel.

---

He told himself he was going to get his passport. The embassy would need his passport. He was going upstairs to get his passport from the locker under Bed 7 and then he was going to the embassy. That was the plan. That was what he was doing.

He climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. The second-floor landing was empty. The Japanese characters watched from under their paint. Dorm 3's door was ajar.

He pushed it open. The dorm was empty -- the transient population of backpackers who had occupied the other beds were out, exploring, living the lives that travellers lived, the lives that Connor had lived for twelve countries and seven months before the thirteenth country and the sixth week changed the category of his existence from *living* to *surviving*.

Bed 7. His bed. The thin mattress. The vinyl surface. The blue towel on the pillow. The wooden frame with LENA carved into the underside of the rail -- the name he'd been sleeping on for forty-six days, the name of the woman who had done what he was doing and ended where he was going.

He opened the locker. His passport was there -- the navy blue Australian passport with the coat of arms on the front, the kangaroo and the emu facing each other across the shield, the animals that couldn't walk backwards, the national symbol that was also, he realised with a clarity that felt like being hit, a description of his situation. Connor Briggs could not walk backwards. Connor Briggs could only go forward, and forward was the suitcase and the bus and the checkpoint.

He held the passport. He could leave now. Walk downstairs, out the door, into a Grab, to the embassy. The passport was in his hand. The embassy was waiting. Priya was in the air, or in a departure lounge, or at a gate, and the letter was in her bag, and the letter was his lifeline, and the lifeline required his cooperation, and his cooperation required his legs to carry him down the staircase and out the door and away from the hostel, away from Felix, away from the machine.

His burner phone buzzed.

The vibration came through the pocket of his board shorts, through the fabric, into his thigh, into the nerve endings that had been conditioned -- over five weeks, over fourteen deliveries, over the Pavlovian training of instruction followed by compliance followed by payment -- to respond to the vibration with attention. The phone was a leash. The phone had always been a leash. The leash vibrated and the dog turned.

He took the phone out.

*Details for today. Come to my room. 10 AM.*

The message was from the number. The number that was Felix. The number that was the network. The number that was the system that had recruited him and used him and was now, in the final act, consuming him.

Ten AM. Seventy minutes from now.

Connor put the passport back in the locker. He sat on Bed 7. He held the burner phone in one hand and the real phone in the other -- the two phones, the two identities, the two lives that had been running in parallel since Day 15 and were about to converge.

He could still go to the embassy. Ten AM was seventy minutes away. The embassy was thirty minutes by Grab. He could be there and back. He could be there and not come back. He could be there, and the *there* would become a different kind of *here*, a *here* that included a consular official and a phone call to Ahmad and the beginning of a process that was terrifying but survivable.

He sat on the bed. He held the phones. The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

At nine fifty-eight, he stood up. He put the burner phone in his left pocket. He put the real phone in his right pocket. He put his passport back in the locker. He locked the locker. He left the dorm.

He climbed the staircase. Not down, toward the door, toward the Grab, toward the embassy. Up. Toward the third floor. Toward Felix's room. Toward the suitcase.

The third step squeaked. The building noted his direction. The building had been noting his direction since Day 1, since the first ascent with a backpack and a confidence that had been eroded, delivery by delivery, into the thing that replaced confidence when confidence was gone, which was momentum -- the pure, directionless, physical fact of a body in motion that continued in motion because stopping required a force and there was no force left, no Priya in the common room, no Jake on the rooftop, no Ahmad on the phone, no force except the gravity of what Felix had built, the gravity that pulled Connor upward, toward the third floor, toward the room where a suitcase waited with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in its lining and a ticket to Penang in its pocket.

He reached the third-floor landing. Felix's door was at the end of the corridor. The door was closed. Behind the door, the German waited. Behind the door, the suitcase waited. Behind the door, the rest of Connor's life waited -- however much of it remained.

He knocked.

The door opened.

---

The common room was empty when Mei Ling came to clean it at eleven. She wiped the counter. She straightened the magazines. She checked the TV remote batteries. She did the things that receptionists did in hostels that had been functioning for ninety-seven years, the routine maintenance of a building that required constant attention because constant attention was what kept entropy at bay.

She paused at the sofa where Connor and Priya had sat. The cushions were still depressed -- the two depressions, side by side, the ghosts of two bodies that had occupied the space an hour ago and left behind only the physics of their weight. She straightened the cushions. The depressions disappeared. The sofa returned to its neutral state, ready for the next bodies, the next conversations, the next goodbyes.

On the reception desk, Priya's checkout form was in the completed pile. Room 4D. Priya Sharma. British. Checked out 09:00, 46th day of stay. Next destination: London Heathrow. No forwarding address. No review left on the guestbook.

Mei Ling filed the form. She opened the booking system on the old desktop computer. Bed 4D was now available. She changed the status to VACANT. By tonight, a new backpacker would be in that bed -- a gap year student, a digital nomad, a solo traveller with a guidebook and a sense of adventure and no idea that the building they were sleeping in was a system, and the system had inputs and outputs, and the outputs were checked-out guests and empty beds and the silence that occupied the space where a person used to be.

She looked toward the staircase. Connor had gone up, not down. She had seen him. She had been at her desk, filing the morning's checkout forms, and she had seen him walk past the reception counter and turn not left, toward the front door, but right, toward the staircase, and climb not to the second floor where his dorm was but to the third floor where Felix's room was, and the climbing was the direction she had been afraid of, the direction that every sign she'd posted and every warning she'd delivered had tried to prevent, the direction that meant the next form she filed for Connor Briggs would not be a checkout form but something else, something that arrived on official letterhead with a police crest and a reference number and the specific, bureaucratic language of a system that processed humans the way conveyor belts processed packages.

She closed the booking system. She picked up the phone. She dialled a number -- not the police, not the embassy, but the number of a man she had known for twenty years, a man who owned the building, a man who had hung a map of deaths on his office wall and watched the pins accumulate.

"Uncle Razak," she said. "Connor went upstairs. To Felix's room. The girl has left."

A pause on the line. The pause of a man receiving information he expected but hoped would not arrive.

"The girl sent a letter," Mei Ling said. "I heard her talking about it. A letter to the police. From London."

Another pause. Longer.

"How long?" Razak asked.

"She said she'd send it when she landed. Her flight is at eleven thirty. She lands in London at--" Mei Ling calculated -- "six AM tomorrow, London time. One PM our time."

"So we have until tomorrow afternoon."

"We have until tomorrow afternoon."

The line was quiet. The hostel was quiet. Somewhere on the third floor, a door opened and closed and the sound travelled through the building's bones -- through the plaster and the timber and the ninety-seven-year-old structure that had been absorbing sounds since the British colonial era -- and the sound reached Mei Ling's ears and she registered it the way she registered every sound in the building, which was with the total, involuntary attention of a woman who lived inside a machine and could not stop listening.

"I'll talk to him," Razak said.

"You've talked to him."

"I'll talk to Felix."

The name -- *Felix* -- sat in the telephone line between them, heavy, electric, the name of the man who had broken the hostel's unwritten rule, the man who had used the building as a base of operations, the man who had taken Uncle Razak's tolerance -- the tolerance that allowed certain activities as long as they remained invisible, as long as the guests remained safe, as long as the building's name remained clean -- and exceeded it, pushed past it, turned the tolerance into complicity and the complicity into guilt.

"Be careful," Mei Ling said.

She hung up. She straightened the reception desk. She aligned the pens. She checked the guest register. She did the things that receptionists did, and the doing was a form of control, and the control was the only thing she had in a building that was accelerating toward something she could feel but not stop, something that moved through the corridors and the staircases and the air well with the silent, inevitable momentum of water finding its level.

The ceiling fan turned in the common room. The red lanterns glowed. The building breathed.

Priya's plane was on the tarmac at KLIA2, loading passengers, preparing for the eleven-hour flight to Heathrow. In the cabin, in seat 34A, a woman with a jade bracelet and a red suitcase and a letter in her bag was looking out the window at the Malaysian landscape -- the palm oil plantations and the construction cranes and the haze that hung over everything like a gauze, like a filter, like the thing that made distance beautiful and proximity unbearable.

She was thinking about Connor. She was thinking about whether *okay* meant *okay* this time. She was thinking about the letter in her bag and the hours between now and London and the things that could happen in those hours in a hostel on Petaling Street where a man she loved was climbing a staircase toward a door behind which his life was being decided by someone who had never cared whether he lived or died.

The plane began to taxi. The engines rose in pitch. The runway appeared through the window, long and grey and straight, the kind of line that existed in only two places: airports and corridors that had no turns.

The plane lifted.

Priya was gone.

---

At eleven thirty-two, as the AirAsia flight to London climbed through seven thousand feet and the Strait of Malacca appeared below as a sheet of hammered silver, Connor Briggs was sitting in Felix Decker's room on the third floor of the Lantern Hostel, looking at a suitcase.

The suitcase was black. Mid-size. Hard-shell. The brand was a Malaysian brand -- a name Connor didn't recognise, the kind of suitcase you bought at a market stall for RM150, the kind that looked like every other suitcase in every other bus luggage compartment in every other transport hub in Southeast Asia. The suitcase was anonymous. The suitcase was designed to be anonymous. The anonymity was the point.

Felix had placed it on the bed -- his bed, the single bed in the private room, the room that cost RM120 per night and had its own bathroom and a window that overlooked the alley and a door with a lock that actually worked. The suitcase lay on the bedspread like a patient on an operating table, its surface catching the overhead light, the black shell reflecting the fluorescent tube in a long, distorted streak.

"Tomorrow," Felix said. "Eight AM bus from TBS -- Terminal Bersepadu Selatan. KL to Penang. Five-hour journey. The bus stops once, at Tapah, for fifteen minutes. The suitcase goes in the luggage compartment. You sit in the bus. You don't touch the suitcase until Penang."

Connor looked at the suitcase. The suitcase looked back. Not literally -- suitcases did not have eyes, did not have intentions, did not participate in the moral calculations of the humans who carried them. But the suitcase occupied the room with the density of an object that knew what it contained, the way a loaded gun occupied a room differently from an unloaded one, the weight of potential changing the atmosphere around it.

"In Penang, you take a Grab to a guesthouse in George Town. I'll give you the address. You check in. A man will come to the guesthouse at three PM. You give him the suitcase. He gives you an envelope. RM10,000. You take the bus back to KL. And you're done."

"Done," Connor repeated.

"Done. Free. No more phones, no more drops, no more schedule. The footage stays where it is. The records stay where they are. You go to Langkawi, to Bali, to wherever. Back to Melbourne if you want. You're done."

Felix's voice was calm, professional, the voice of a man concluding a business arrangement, the voice that had been calibrated -- through years of recruiting mules in hostels across Southeast Asia, through Lena and the mules before Lena and the mules who would come after Connor -- to deliver the final briefing with authority and reassurance braided together, the two strands indistinguishable. The authority said: *this is happening*. The reassurance said: *and then it's over*.

"What's in the suitcase?" Connor said.

The question was ceremonial. He knew what was in the suitcase. He had known since the rooftop. He had known since the charger box at Wei's. He had known, if he was honest with the honesty that had arrived five weeks too late, since the first envelope. The question was not a question but a ritual -- the last act of the machine, the denial machine, the machine that had run for five weeks on the fuel of *I don't know for certain* and was now running on fumes, on vapour, on the final wisps of a fiction that had been sustaining him since Day 6.

Felix looked at him. Felix's expression was patient -- the patience of a man who had answered this question before, from other mouths, in other rooms, in other hostels in other cities. The question was part of the script. The answer was part of the script. The script had been written by the network and performed by the network and the network had been performing it for years and would continue performing it after Connor was gone.

"Four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine," Felix said. "Sealed in vacuum bags, sewn into the lining of the suitcase. The suitcase will pass a visual inspection. It will pass an X-ray -- the bags are layered between the shell and the fabric lining, the density is consistent with the shell's polymer. It will not pass a dog."

*It will not pass a dog.*

The sentence arrived in Connor's mind and detonated there with the quiet force of a fact that contained its own consequence. The suitcase would pass a visual inspection and an X-ray but would not pass a dog. The sentence meant: if there is a dog at the checkpoint, you are dead. The sentence meant: your life depends on the absence of a dog. The sentence meant: the distance between living and dying is the distance between a bus that is stopped and inspected by an officer with a dog and a bus that is waved through by an officer without one.

"How many checkpoints?" Connor said.

"Usually one. Sometimes none. The North-South Expressway has random checkpoints -- PDRM sets them up on a rotating schedule. Fridays are usually quiet. That's why we're going Friday."

"Usually."

"Usually."

The word *usually* was the margin. The word *usually* was the space between survival and execution. The word *usually* was the width of the plank that Connor was being asked to walk, and the width was determined not by Felix or by Connor but by the Royal Malaysia Police and their deployment schedule and the dogs that the dogs' handlers decided to bring or not bring on a Friday morning on the North-South Expressway between Kuala Lumpur and Penang.

Connor sat in Felix's room and looked at the suitcase and the suitcase was black and mid-size and anonymous and inside it, in the lining, in the vacuum-sealed bags that Wei had sealed in the back room of the phone repair shop, was the substance that Malaysian law considered sufficient to warrant the killing of the person who carried it. The substance was 450 grams. The threshold was 50. The ratio was nine to one. Connor was carrying nine times the amount required to trigger the mandatory death penalty.

Nine to one. Those were not odds. Those were a measurement of how far past the line he had gone, how deep into the territory of irreversible consequence he had travelled. The line was at fifty grams and he was at four hundred and fifty and the distance between them was the distance that separated a prison sentence from a death sentence, a courtroom from a gallows, a life from no life.

"I'll send you the bus ticket tonight," Felix said. "The Grab to TBS leaves at seven-fifteen. The suitcase stays in my room until tomorrow morning. You pick it up at seven. You carry it downstairs. You get in the car. You go."

Connor nodded. The nod was the agreement. The nod was the contract. The nod was the final motion of a man who had been nodding for five weeks -- nodding to envelopes, nodding to packages, nodding to backpacks, nodding to charger boxes -- and the nodding had become the only language he spoke, the language of compliance, the vocabulary of a man who had forgotten how to say no because the machine had removed the word from his dictionary, had replaced it with *yeah* and *sure* and *no worries* and the Australian casualness that was also, it turned out, the perfect language for a drug mule, the language that treated everything as minor, that treated death as an inconvenience, that treated the end of a life as something that would sort itself out.

He left Felix's room. He descended the staircase. The third step squeaked. The common room was empty. The sofa cushions were flat -- Mei Ling had straightened them, erasing the impression of two bodies that had sat there an hour ago, one of them now at seven thousand feet and climbing, the other descending.

Connor went to Bed 7. He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. The towel was smooth and cool, the microfiber that had been to twelve countries and would go to one more -- not as luggage but as evidence, not as comfort but as instrument, the blue fabric that would be present at the end of something that was already ending.

The ceiling fan turned.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

Tomorrow.
