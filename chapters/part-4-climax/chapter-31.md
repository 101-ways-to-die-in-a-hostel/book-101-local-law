# Chapter 31: Terminal

Terminal Bersepadu Selatan was designed to process human beings the way factories processed raw material -- efficiently, in volume, without sentiment.

The building was vast -- a steel and glass cathedral of transit, opened in 2010, serving as the southern gateway for buses departing Kuala Lumpur to every destination the peninsula offered: Penang to the north, Johor Bahru to the south, Kuantan to the east, and every kampung and city in between. The architecture was modern -- clean lines, high ceilings, the aesthetic of a country that was building its future out of concrete and ambition and the particular Malaysian combination of Islamic geometry and corporate minimalism. The floor was polished tile, the walls glass, and the air conditioning aggressive, the temperature dropping ten degrees between the outside heat and the interior cool, the transition so sharp it felt like entering a different climate, a different country, a different phase of existence.

Connor entered TBS at seven forty-two AM carrying a black hard-shell suitcase that contained four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine and the clothes of a man who was pretending to go on holiday.

The Grab driver had made the trip from Petaling Street to TBS in twenty-seven minutes. The traffic had been light -- Friday morning, the roads emptier than weekdays, the city moving at the reduced tempo of a population that understood that Friday was for the mosque and for family and for the things that mattered more than work. The driver had played Malay pop on the car stereo -- a woman's voice, sweet and melancholy, singing about something Connor couldn't translate but could feel, the emotional content transcending the language barrier the way all good music did.

It was in the boot. Connor had loaded it himself and unloaded it himself and the loading and unloading had been the actions of a man performing a task he had rehearsed -- not physically, not in practice, but in the theatre of his imagination, where he had been carrying this suitcase for days, carrying it in his dreams and his sleepless hours and the corridors of his mind where the suitcase waited like a prop for a play that had been written before he was born.

He rolled the suitcase across the TBS concourse. The wheels hummed on the polished tile -- a low, smooth sound, the sound of plastic on stone, the sound that every suitcase made in every terminal in every country, the universal frequency of departure. The suitcase rolled easily. The telescopic handle extended to the right height. The wheels tracked straight. The suitcase was, in its mechanical operation, flawless -- the anonymous, functional perfection of a mass-produced object doing exactly what it was designed to do.

The concourse was busy. Morning departures generated a crowd that was diverse in the specific way that Malaysian crowds were diverse: Malay families in modest dress, the women in tudung, the men in collared shirts; Chinese-Malaysian businesspeople with laptop bags and the brisk efficiency of people who treated buses as moving offices; Indian-Malaysian students with backpacks and earbuds; foreign tourists with oversized luggage and the bewildered expressions of people navigating a system designed for locals.

Connor was one of the tourists. His appearance -- the board shorts, the white T-shirt, the Birkenstocks, the sunburn, the daypack -- placed him in the category instantly. A backpacker. A traveller. A young foreigner taking a bus to Penang, probably for the beaches, probably for the food, probably for the Instagram content that Penang's street art and hawker stalls generated in quantities that made the city one of Southeast Asia's most photographed destinations.

He was invisible. The category made him invisible. The category was a costume, and the costume was so complete, so consistent with the thousands of other backpackers who passed through TBS every week, that no one looked twice. The ticket counter attendant processed his booking with the mechanical attention of a person who had sold ten thousand tickets. The security guard at the gate glanced at his ticket and waved him through. The porter who directed passengers to the correct bay pointed at Bay 14 without making eye contact.

Bay 14. Transnasional service 1087. Kuala Lumpur to Penang. Departing 08:00. Arriving approximately 13:00.

The bus was a double-decker -- a Scania, white with blue stripes, the Transnasional logo on the side, the windshield tinted against the morning sun. The luggage compartment was open, the belly of the bus yawning, the interior a dark cavity lined with rubber matting that smelled of diesel and the accumulated journeys of a vehicle that had made this trip thousands of times.

Connor handed the suitcase to the luggage handler. The handler was a Malay man in a Transnasional uniform -- blue polo shirt, company cap, the build of a man who spent his days lifting luggage and the posture of a man for whom luggage was luggage, all the same, all heavy, all going somewhere. He took the suitcase by the handle. He lifted it. He placed it in the compartment alongside the other bags -- duffle bags, backpacks, suitcases of every size and colour, the collective cargo of forty-four passengers heading north.

The suitcase was in the bus. The suitcase was no longer in Connor's hands. The physical separation -- the three metres between his body and the suitcase, the steel floor of the luggage compartment between his feet and the drugs -- changed nothing legally. Legally, the suitcase was his. The ticket had his name. The booking had his passport number. The suitcase's contents, if discovered, would be attributed to the person whose name was on the ticket, which was Connor James Briggs, Australian passport number PA7834521, Bed 7, Dorm 3, the Lantern Hostel, 28 Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur.

But the physical separation changed something else. It changed the sensation. It was no longer pulling his arm, no longer connected to his body by the handle, no longer the physical extension of himself that it had been for the past forty-two minutes. The suitcase was in the dark. It sat with other bags. It was anonymous, invisible, one object among thirty, and the anonymity was a form of relief -- the relief of a man who has put down a heavy thing and can, for a moment, pretend the heavy thing doesn't exist.

He boarded the bus. Climbed the stairs to the upper deck. Found seat 22B -- window seat, right side, midway along the upper deck. The seat was the standard bus seat: fabric upholstery in a blue-grey pattern designed to hide stains, a headrest that adjusted, a recline function, a footrest. The seat was clean, the air conditioning on. The window was large, tinted, the outside world visible through a filter of grey-blue that muted colours and softened edges, the world as seen through sunglasses, the world at a remove.

He sat. He put his daypack on the floor between his feet. He put his seatbelt on. He looked out the window.

TBS's bus bays stretched in a row -- twenty, thirty bays, each with a bus or the space for a bus, the bays numbered and labelled with destinations: JOHOR BAHRU, MELAKA, IPOH, KUANTAN, BUTTERWORTH, PENANG. The destinations were the geography of a country spread across a peninsula, connected by roads that the British had built and the Japanese had bombed and the Malaysians had rebuilt and expanded into a highway network that was the circulatory system of a nation, the arteries through which people and goods and the invisible currents of commerce moved from city to city, state to state, north to south and back.

The bus began to fill. Passengers climbed the stairs and found their seats and performed the rituals of bus travel: adjusting headrests, connecting earbuds, opening snacks, arranging blankets. An elderly Malay couple took the seats across the aisle -- the woman in a blue tudung, the man in a batik shirt, their movements synchronised by decades of shared travel, the coordination of two people who had been sitting beside each other on buses for longer than Connor had been alive. Behind Connor, a young Chinese-Malaysian woman opened a laptop and began typing, the keys clicking in a rapid, competent rhythm. In front of him, a Malay teenager put on noise-cancelling headphones and closed his eyes.

The bus was filling with ordinary people doing an ordinary thing on an ordinary Friday morning. Going to Penang. Going north. Going to see family or attend a meeting or start a holiday or return to a life that was waiting at the other end of five hours and four hundred kilometres of North-South Expressway.

Connor was doing none of these things. Connor was carrying a suitcase. The suitcase was in the compartment beneath his feet, beneath the floor of the upper deck, beneath the layers of steel and rubber and the other bags. The suitcase was down there with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine in vacuum-sealed bags sewn into the lining, and the suitcase was waiting, patient as stone, for the journey that would either deliver it to Penang or deliver Connor to a cell.

The engine started. The bus vibrated -- a deep, diesel vibration that travelled through the chassis and the seats and into the bodies of the passengers, the mechanical heartbeat of a vehicle preparing to move. The driver appeared on the intercom -- a voice in Malay, then English, then Mandarin, delivering the standard announcements: welcome, destination, duration, rest stop, safety.

"Selamat datang ke perkhidmatan Transnasional nombor satu kosong lapan tujuh. Destinasi kami ialah Penang Sentral. Perjalanan mengambil masa lebih kurang lima jam..."

*Welcome to Transnasional service 1087. Our destination is Penang Sentral. The journey will take approximately five hours...*

The English translation followed: rest stop at Tapah, approximately two hours in. No smoking. Seatbelts required. Emergency exits marked. Thank you for travelling with Transnasional.

The bus reversed out of Bay 14. The movement was slow, heavy, the deliberate manoeuvring of a vehicle that was forty-five feet long and carried forty-four passengers and their luggage and the weight of all their reasons for travelling. The bus straightened. The bus moved forward. The bay disappeared. TBS disappeared. The bus entered the access road that led to the highway.

Connor watched through the tinted window. KL was passing. The southern suburbs -- the apartment blocks and the shopping centres and the construction sites that were the permanent condition of a city that was always building, always growing, always adding to itself. The skyline was behind him now, the Petronas Towers visible in the rear window of the upper deck, the twin silver columns growing smaller as the bus moved north, the towers that had been his constant landmark for forty-seven days shrinking to the size of fingers, then needles, then nothing.

The bus merged onto the North-South Expressway. The highway was six lanes -- three north, three south, divided by a concrete median, the surface smooth black asphalt that the tyres hummed on, the hum blending with the air conditioning and the engine and the accumulated sounds of forty-four people settling into the specific condition of bus travel, which was the condition of waiting -- waiting for the destination, waiting for the rest stop, waiting for the journey to end.

Connor was waiting for the checkpoint.

---

The North-South Expressway was the longest highway in Malaysia. Eight hundred kilometres from Johor Bahru in the south to Bukit Kayu Hitam at the Thai border in the north, cutting through the peninsula's western states -- Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Penang, Kedah -- the highway was the spine of Peninsular Malaysia, the central axis around which the country's road network organised itself.

The highway was also where the checkpoints were.

PDRM -- Polis Diraja Malaysia, the Royal Malaysia Police -- operated random checkpoints on the expressway. The checkpoints were not permanent installations but mobile operations, set up and taken down on a rotating schedule that was, according to Felix, unpredictable by design. The police chose locations based on intelligence, traffic patterns, and the operational requirements of whatever enforcement campaign was currently active: drunk driving during festivals, immigration checks during border surges, drug interdiction during... always. Drug interdiction was always active. The Dangerous Drugs Act was not seasonal. The death penalty was not seasonal. The law operated year-round, checkpoint by checkpoint, dog by dog, the steady, mechanical enforcement of a statute that had been in effect since 1952 and showed no sign of changing.

Felix had said Fridays were usually quiet. Felix had said the checkpoints were less likely on Fridays because the traffic was lighter and the police resources were allocated to the weekend operations -- the clubs, the bars, the entertainment districts where drug use was visible and arrests were easy and the statistics looked good in reports. Felix had said *usually*.

Connor sat in seat 22B and watched the highway unfold and the word *usually* was the only word in his vocabulary, the word that his mind repeated on a loop, the word that was simultaneously a comfort and a threat, the word that meant *probably safe* and *possibly not* and the gap between the two was the gap that his life depended on.

The bus passed kilometre markers. The markers were green signs with white numbers, counting up from KL: KM 50, KM 75, KM 100. Each marker was a unit of distance from the city and a unit of distance toward Penang and a unit of distance through the territory where checkpoints existed, the territory that Connor was traversing at one hundred and ten kilometres per hour in a vehicle that contained, in its belly, the substance that triggered Section 39B.

He watched the landscape. The highway cut through terrain that alternated between the two dominant conditions of Peninsular Malaysia: palm oil plantations and jungle. The plantations were geometric -- rows of oil palms stretching to the horizon in parallel lines, the regularity of industrial agriculture imposed on land that had been jungle before the British arrived and decided that the jungle was wasteful and the oil palm was profitable. Between the plantations, remnants of the original forest survived -- hills covered in green, the canopy dense and dark, the kind of green that existed only in equatorial forests, the green of maximum photosynthesis, of chlorophyll working at the peak of its evolutionary efficiency.

The bus moved through this landscape at speed, the scenery streaming past the tinted windows in a blur of green and grey and the occasional interruption of a town -- Seremban, the capital of Negeri Sembilan, visible from the highway as a cluster of buildings and minarets; then smaller towns, kampungs, the wooden houses on stilts that were the traditional Malay dwelling, the houses that looked fragile from the highway but were in fact resilient, designed for floods and heat and the specific conditions of a tropical climate.

Connor watched and saw nothing. The landscape was there but he was not receiving it. His senses were allocated entirely to the road ahead -- scanning for the signs of a checkpoint: the orange cones, the police vehicles, the barriers that narrowed the highway from three lanes to one, the officers in blue standing at the shoulder with their hands out, their faces carrying the professional blankness of men who had been stopping vehicles for hours and would continue stopping vehicles for hours more.

No cones. No barriers. No officers. The highway was clear. The first hour passed. KM 100. KM 125. KM 150.

The bus was quiet. The passengers had settled into the particular torpor of long-distance bus travel -- the headphones in, the eyes closed, the phones held loosely, the collective surrender to the vehicle's motion and the air conditioning's hum and the gentle, rocking progress of a bus moving north on a good road. The elderly couple across the aisle had opened a container of kuih -- traditional cakes, small, colourful, the kind that grandmothers made and carried in Tupperware for journeys. The woman offered Connor a kuih. He took it. It was green -- pandan-flavoured, coconut-filled, sweet. He ate it. The taste was good. The taste was the taste of a normal thing happening on a normal bus on a normal day, and the normalcy was unbearable because the normalcy was a lie and the lie was the last lie, the lie of a man eating a pandan cake on a bus that was carrying enough methamphetamine to trigger a death sentence, the lie so perfect and so complete that even Connor, who knew it was a lie, could almost believe it.

He thanked the woman. "Terima kasih, makcik." The Malay word for auntie -- *makcik* -- the respectful address that Priya had taught him in their first week, the word that Priya had said was important because language was not just communication but relationship, and relationship was how you survived in a country that was not your own.

The woman smiled. The smile was warm, genuine, the smile of a grandmother who had offered food to a young foreigner and received the correct response. She did not know what was in the luggage compartment. She did not know that the polite young man in the white T-shirt was carrying her country's death sentence in a suitcase twenty feet below her seat. She smiled because smiling was what you did when a stranger said *makcik* and meant it, and Connor had meant it, and the meaning was the last authentic thing he'd produced, the last word that came from the person rather than the machine.

---

The rest stop at Tapah arrived at ten fifteen.

Tapah was a service area on the expressway -- a large building with restaurants, a convenience store, a prayer room, toilets, and a parking area where the buses stopped and the passengers disembarked and stretched their legs and bought food and performed the rituals of the rest stop, which were the same rituals in every country: eat, drink, use the bathroom, stand in the sun for five minutes, get back on the bus.

The bus pulled into the parking area. The driver announced fifteen minutes. The passengers rose -- slowly, stiffly, the collective unbending of forty-four bodies that had been seated for two hours. They filed down the stairs and out the door and into the heat of Tapah, which was the heat of a service area in Perak at ten fifteen in the morning, the heat magnified by the asphalt parking lot and the reflected light from the building's glass facade and the exhaust from a dozen idling buses.

Connor got off the bus. He stood in the parking area and looked at the luggage compartment. The compartment was closed. The luggage handler had not opened it -- the rest stop was for passengers, not cargo, and the cargo remained in the dark, in the compartment, where it had been since TBS.

He went to the toilet. He washed his hands. He looked at his face in the mirror. The face was the face of a man who had not slept and had eaten one plate of nasi lemak and had been on a bus for two hours with four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine under his feet. The face was thin -- thinner than it had been forty-seven days ago, the weight lost not to diet or exercise but to the metabolic cost of sustained fear, the body burning calories to fuel the anxiety that had been his constant companion since the first envelope. His eyes were bloodshot, his skin grey under the sunburn, his mouth a line -- not frowning, not neutral, just a line, the expression of a man who had used up all his expressions and was left with the default, which was nothing.

He splashed water on his face. He dried it with a paper towel. He went to the convenience store and bought a bottle of water and a packet of Mamee noodle snacks, the bright yellow packet that was in every convenience store in Malaysia, the crunchy, MSG-laden snack that tasted like childhood to every Malaysian and like novelty to every tourist and like nothing to Connor, who ate them standing in the parking area beside the bus, crunching the dry noodles and drinking the water and watching the highway where cars and trucks and motorcycles passed in a continuous stream, the traffic flowing north and south, the arterial pulse of a country moving.

He looked north. The highway stretched ahead, straight and flat, disappearing into the haze that hung over the landscape. Somewhere up there, between here and Penang, was the checkpoint. Or wasn't. The checkpoint existed in a state of quantum uncertainty -- present and absent simultaneously, real and imaginary, the observation collapsing the wave function, the dog or no dog, the stop or the wave-through, the life or the death.

*Usually quiet on Fridays.*

He got back on the bus. Seat 22B. Seatbelt. The window. The driver started the engine. The bus reversed. The bus moved forward. Tapah receded. The highway opened ahead.

KM 200. KM 225. KM 250.

The second hour began.

---

At eleven twenty-two, the bus slowed.

The slowing was gradual -- not the abrupt deceleration of a stop but the controlled reduction of speed that buses performed when approaching something ahead, the driver's foot easing off the accelerator, the engine note dropping, the vibration changing frequency, the bus transitioning from highway speed to something slower, more cautious, the speed of a vehicle approaching an event rather than a distance.

Connor looked through the windshield. The upper deck gave him a view over the highway that the lower deck passengers didn't have -- the elevated perspective of a seat four metres above the road surface, the view that showed the road ahead for a kilometre or more.

Orange cones.

The cones were visible first. Small, bright, the orange that was designed to be seen, the colour of warning, the colour of deviation from the normal. The cones were arranged in a line across the highway's left lanes, funnelling three lanes into one, the traffic narrowing, the cars ahead slowing, the collective deceleration of a hundred vehicles responding to the presence of the cones the way a river responded to a narrowing channel -- pressure building, speed reducing, the flow compressing.

Behind the cones, vehicles. Police vehicles. Blue and white Proton Wira patrol cars, parked on the shoulder. Two of them. No, three. And a van -- a larger vehicle, the kind used for operations that required space, the kind that carried equipment, the kind that carried dogs.

The word *dog* arrived in Connor's mind and detonated there with the force of a bomb that had been ticking since TBS.

He couldn't see a dog. The distance was too great -- five hundred metres, maybe six hundred. The vehicles were there, the officers were there, the cones were there, but the dog was not visible at this distance, the dog being a detail that required proximity to confirm, and proximity was coming, metre by metre, as the bus slowed and the distance closed and the five hundred metres became four hundred became three hundred and the details of the checkpoint resolved from a general blur into specific images: officers in blue, a raised hand, a barrier across the single open lane, a table set up on the shoulder where papers were examined and questions were asked.

Connor's body responded before his mind. The body produced adrenaline -- the surge that arrived not as an emotion but as a physical event, the heart rate spiking, the blood redirecting, the extremities tingling with the primal electricity of a body preparing for something it had been preparing for since the first envelope on Day 6. The adrenaline was not new -- it had been present, in lower doses, since he'd picked up the suitcase this morning, a background hum of chemical readiness. But the cones triggered a spike, a peak, the body's recognition that the theoretical had become actual and the actual required response.

His hands gripped the armrests. The grip was tight, the knuckles white, the tendons visible beneath the skin. The grip was involuntary -- the body's attempt to hold onto something solid in a moment when everything else was fluid, uncertain, the moment when the road ahead was no longer a road but a gate, and the gate was controlled by men in blue who had the authority to open the luggage compartment and the training to recognise what was in the suitcase's lining.

The bus was three hundred metres from the checkpoint. Two hundred and fifty. Two hundred.

He could see the officers now. Three of them. Two at the barrier, one at the table. They wore the blue uniform of the PDRM -- the standard patrol uniform, short-sleeved shirts, dark trousers, the peaked caps with the royal insignia. One officer had a clipboard. One had a flashlight -- unnecessary in the daylight but carried as a tool, the flashlight's purpose not illumination but examination, the focused beam that could be directed into a luggage compartment's dark interior to reveal what the ambient light concealed.

No dog. Connor's eyes scanned the checkpoint with the desperate thoroughness of a man looking for the one detail that determined whether he lived or died. No dog at the barrier. No dog at the table. No dog visible near the vehicles. No handler with a leash. No kennel. No dog.

But the van. The van was there, and the van was the kind that carried dogs, and the van's rear doors were closed, and the closed doors could mean the van was empty or the van was occupied and the dog was inside and the dog was waiting and the van's doors would open when the van's handler decided to deploy the dog and the deployment might happen now or might happen for the next vehicle or might not happen at all.

One hundred and fifty metres. One hundred. The bus was decelerating through forty, thirty, twenty kilometres per hour. The brake lights of the cars ahead were a chain of red, the line of vehicles narrowing to single file, the traffic feeding through the gap in the cones like sand through an hourglass, one vehicle at a time, the checkpoint processing each vehicle with the methodical patience of a system designed for exactly this -- the interception, the examination, the sorting of the compliant from the non-compliant, the clean from the dirty, the innocent from the guilty.

Fifty metres. The bus stopped.

The bus was in the queue. Three vehicles ahead -- a sedan, a pickup truck, another sedan. The officers were processing the first sedan. The driver had his window down. An officer was leaning in, speaking, the conversation invisible from the bus but the body language readable: the officer's posture was relaxed, professional, the posture of routine. The driver's posture was compliant, eager, the posture of a citizen being checked and wanting to pass. Papers were exchanged. The officer glanced at the papers. The officer waved the sedan through. The sedan accelerated. The pickup truck advanced.

The queue moved. The bus advanced. Twenty metres from the barrier.

Connor's breathing was wrong. Too fast, too shallow, the breath catching in the top of his chest rather than reaching his diaphragm, the respiratory pattern of a body in fight-or-flight that had chosen neither fight nor flight but freeze, the third option, the option that the textbooks called tonic immobility, the option that the body selected when the other two options were impossible, when the threat was too large to fight and there was nowhere to flee and the only remaining strategy was to become very, very still and hope that stillness was the same as invisibility.

He forced a breath. Deep. Slow. The breath reached his diaphragm. The diaphragm expanded. The ribcage moved. The breath was an act of will, the conscious override of an autonomous system that had malfunctioned, the mind reaching down into the body's machinery and manually operating the bellows because the bellows had stopped operating themselves.

The pickup truck was at the barrier. An officer approached. Papers. Conversation. The officer looked at the truck bed -- empty, a blue tarp folded in the corner. The officer waved the truck through. The sedan behind the truck advanced.

The sedan. Papers. Conversation. The officer was quicker with this one -- a glance at the driver, a glance at the papers, a wave. Through.

The bus advanced to the barrier.

An officer approached the driver's window. The window was at the lower deck level -- Connor, on the upper deck, could not see the conversation but could feel the bus's engine idle change as the driver slowed to a complete stop, the vibration dropping to a low, bass hum.

The conversation took thirty seconds. The driver showed papers -- the bus manifest, the company documentation, whatever papers buses showed at checkpoints. The officer looked at the papers. The officer looked at the bus -- a quick scan, the eyes moving across the windows of the lower deck, then up to the upper deck.

The officer's eyes passed across Connor's window. Connor was one of forty-four faces visible through the tinted glass, one of forty-four passengers arranged in rows, all looking ahead or at their phones or sleeping, the collective passivity of a busload of people being checked by the police and responding with the universal response to police checks, which was to be very quiet and very still and hope the check ended quickly.

The officer looked at Connor's window for less than a second. The look was not focused on Connor -- the look was the general scan of a man checking a bus, the same scan he'd performed on the previous bus and would perform on the next. Connor was a face in a window. Connor was a tourist. Connor was invisible.

The officer stepped back. He raised his hand. He waved.

The bus moved forward. The bus passed the barrier. The bus passed the cones. The bus accelerated. The checkpoint receded in the rear window -- the cones, the vehicles, the officers, the table, the van with its closed doors -- all of it shrinking, diminishing, the geometry of the checkpoint collapsing from three-dimensional reality into a memory, a thing that had happened and was now behind them.

The bus merged back into three lanes. The highway opened. The speed returned to one hundred and ten. The engine note rose. The vibration normalised.

Connor's hands were still gripping the armrests. The knuckles were still white. The tendons were still visible. His body had not received the message that the checkpoint was past, that the danger was behind them, that the cones were a kilometre back and receding. The body was still in the freeze state, still operating on the adrenaline spike that had arrived with the first sight of the orange cones, the body lagging behind the reality by the interval that the brain required to process the transition from danger to safety.

Safety. The word was wrong. The word implied that the checkpoint had been the danger and passing it had eliminated the danger. The word was wrong because the danger was not behind him. The danger was beneath him, in the luggage compartment, in the black suitcase, where it would remain for the rest of the journey. The checkpoint had been one gate. There might be another. There might be another set of cones, another set of officers, another van with closed doors that might this time have open doors and behind the open doors a dog, a German shepherd or a Belgian Malinois or whatever breed the PDRM used, a dog whose nose could detect methamphetamine through vacuum sealing and suitcase lining and the collective olfactory noise of thirty pieces of luggage in a confined space.

He released the armrests. The releasing was a deliberate act -- the mind ordering the hands to open, the hands complying, the fingers uncurling, the blood returning to the fingertips in a rush of pins and needles. He flexed his hands. The hands shook. The shaking was visible -- the tremor that had been his companion since Wei's back room had returned, amplified by the adrenaline and the fear and the specific, profound physical relief of having passed a checkpoint that he'd expected to end his life.

KM 300. KM 325.

The highway continued north. The landscape was changing -- the flat central plains giving way to the foothills that preceded the Titiwangsa Range, the mountains that formed the spine of the peninsula. The hills were green, dense, the jungle that covered them old and dark and unconcerned with the highway that cut through their foothills, unconcerned with the buses and the trucks and the cars that carried humans and their cargo and their fears through a landscape that had existed for millions of years before humans arrived and would exist for millions after they left.

Connor closed his eyes. The bus rocked gently. The air conditioning hummed. The passengers around him slept or read or stared at phones, and the bus carried them north, and the suitcase was in the dark, and the checkpoint was behind them, and the road to Penang was open.

One hour to go.

He might survive this. The thought arrived not as hope but as information, the way all his thoughts now arrived -- flat, clinical, the emotional content stripped away by the adrenaline crash that followed the spike, the body's chemical hangover, the particular exhaustion of a system that had prepared for catastrophe and received reprieve. He might survive this. He might arrive in Penang. He might deliver the suitcase. He might collect the RM10,000. He might return to KL. He might be free.

*Usually quiet on Fridays.*

The thought lasted eight seconds. Then the bus slowed again.

---

The second checkpoint was different from the first.

The first checkpoint had been a routine operation -- three officers, a barrier, the quick processing of vehicles through a single lane. The first checkpoint had been the machinery of enforcement operating at its baseline level, the minimum deployment, the perfunctory check.

The second checkpoint was not perfunctory.

Connor saw it from six hundred metres. The upper deck's elevation gave him the view. The cones were there -- orange, bright, the same as before. The police vehicles were there -- but more of them. Five. No, six. Blue and white Proton Wiras and a truck and two vans, the vans larger than the one at the first checkpoint, the vans parked perpendicular to the highway, their rear doors open.

Open.

The doors were open and behind the doors, visible even at this distance because the contrast between the dark interior and the bright daylight made the shapes inside visible, were crates. Crates and the forms of handlers. And the forms of dogs.

Connor saw the dogs and the seeing was the end of something.

The end was not dramatic -- not a scream or a collapse or the cinematic moment of a man undone by the sight of his fate. The end was quiet. The end was the cessation of the last thread of the fiction -- the fiction that he would arrive in Penang, deliver the suitcase, collect the money, return to KL, be free. The fiction that Felix's *usually* was a promise rather than a probability. The fiction that four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine could travel the North-South Expressway on a Friday morning in a bus with forty-four passengers and pass through a checkpoint with dogs without being detected.

The fiction ended. What replaced it was not panic. What replaced it was a clarity so complete and so sudden that it felt like a physical sensation -- like a light being switched on in a room that had been dark for forty-seven days, the room illuminated all at once, every corner visible, every object named, the room revealed to be exactly the shape and size that he'd been told it was by Priya and Tomoko and Mama Siti and Mei Ling and Ahmad and Razak and every person who had tried to warn him and been ignored.

The clarity said: *This is it. This is where it ends. This is the checkpoint with the dog and the dog will find what's in the suitcase and the officers will open the suitcase and the lining will be cut and the bags will be extracted and the bags will be weighed and the weight will be four hundred and fifty grams and the number will trigger Section 39B and Section 39B will trigger the mandatory death penalty and the mandatory death penalty will end your life.*

The clarity was not fear. The clarity was beyond fear. The clarity was the state that existed on the other side of fear, the state where fear had burned so hot and so long that it consumed its own fuel and what remained was the ash of fear, the grey, light, weightless residue that fear left behind when fear was finished.

The bus slowed. Two hundred metres. One hundred and fifty.

Connor could see the dogs clearly now. Two of them. German shepherds. On leashes, held by handlers in the PDRM's K-9 unit uniform. The dogs were calm -- sitting on the highway shoulder, their ears up, their posture alert but relaxed, the posture of working dogs who were waiting to work, who understood their function, who would perform their function with the mechanical reliability of animals trained to detect specific molecular compounds through layers of plastic and fabric and suitcase lining.

The bus stopped. The bus was third in the queue. Two vehicles ahead -- a sedan and a delivery truck. The sedan was being checked. An officer was speaking to the driver. Another officer was walking around the sedan with a flashlight, examining the exterior, the trunk, the wheel wells. A handler walked a dog around the sedan. The dog circled. The dog paused at the trunk. The dog moved on. The dog did not alert. The sedan was waved through.

The delivery truck. The officers approached. Papers were examined. The truck's rear doors were opened. An officer climbed in. A handler walked a dog around the truck. The dog circled. The dog showed no interest. The officer emerged from the truck's interior. The truck was waved through.

The bus was next.

Connor's phone buzzed. The burner phone. In his pocket. The vibration arrived against his thigh with the familiar, Pavlovian urgency that it always carried. He took out the phone.

Felix.

*How's the journey? Everything smooth?*

Connor stared at the message. The message was the message of a man checking on a delivery, the way a logistics manager checked on a shipment, the way a handler checked on a mule. The message was professional, casual, the tone of a man for whom this was routine, who had sent this same message to Lena and to the mules before Lena and would send it to the mules after Connor.

He didn't reply. He put the phone back in his pocket.

The bus advanced to the checkpoint. An officer approached the driver's window. The conversation began. Papers. The officer took the manifest. He looked at it. He looked at the bus.

A second officer appeared at the luggage compartment. The officer carried keys -- the universal keys that officers carried for luggage compartments, the keys that opened any bus belly regardless of company or model. The officer inserted a key. The compartment door swung open. The compartment's interior was visible -- the dark space, the rubber matting, the bags.

A handler appeared with a dog.

The dog was led to the luggage compartment. The dog lowered its nose. The dog's nostrils flared -- the incredible, evolved machinery of the canine olfactory system engaging, processing the molecular information contained in the air of a luggage compartment that held thirty pieces of luggage and the particular, distinctive chemical signature of methamphetamine.

The dog moved along the compartment. Bag by bag. Sniffing. Processing. The handler watched. The handler's grip on the leash was loose -- the grip of a man who trusted his dog, who knew that the dog's nose was more reliable than any technology, who had watched the dog detect substances through vacuum sealing and plastic wrap and the defensive chemistry of industrial-grade concealment.

Connor watched from the upper deck. He watched through the tinted window, looking down at the angle that the upper deck provided, the angle that showed the luggage compartment and the dog and the handler and the bags. He could see his suitcase. The black hard-shell. It was in the middle of the compartment, wedged between a large duffle bag and a floral-print suitcase belonging to the elderly couple across the aisle.

The dog reached the duffle bag. Sniffed. Moved on. The dog reached the floral suitcase. Sniffed. Moved on.

The dog reached the black suitcase.

The dog stopped.

The dog's body changed. The ears, already up, came forward. The tail stiffened. The nose pressed against the suitcase's surface -- the hard-shell plastic, the surface through which the molecules of methamphetamine had migrated, through the vacuum bags and the fabric lining and the polymer shell, the molecules too small to be stopped by any physical barrier but large enough to be detected by the 300 million olfactory receptors in a German shepherd's nose.

The dog sat.

The sitting was the alert. The sit was the signal. The dog sat beside the black suitcase and looked at its handler and the handler looked at the dog and the handler's face changed -- from the relaxed attention of routine work to the focused, sharpened attention of a man whose dog had found something, the attention that activated the next phase of the protocol, the phase that involved extracting the bag and opening it and examining its contents and identifying its owner and the identification leading to an arrest and the arrest leading to a charge and the charge leading to the courtroom and the courtroom leading to the sentence and the sentence leading to death.

The handler called to the officers. His voice was audible through the bus's window -- a single word, clear, the word that changed everything.

"*Positif.*"

The word entered the bus through the glass and the air conditioning and the metal and reached Connor's ears and the word was the period at the end of a sentence that had been forty-seven days in the writing, the last word of the story that had begun in a common room with a beer and a German accent and a smile.

Officers converged on the compartment. The suitcase was extracted. The suitcase was placed on the highway shoulder. The suitcase was opened -- not the main compartment but the lining, an officer producing a utility knife and cutting through the fabric with the practiced strokes of a man who had done this before, who knew where to cut, who knew what he would find.

The vacuum bags appeared. Clear plastic, sealed, the contents visible -- white crystalline substance, compressed into flat rectangles, five bags, each labelled by no one because labels were not part of the packaging process at Wei's shop. The bags were placed on the ground beside the suitcase. An officer put on gloves. An officer opened a test kit -- the small, portable narcotics identification kit that field officers carried, the kit that contained the reagent that turned blue in the presence of methamphetamine.

The reagent turned blue.

---

The bus door opened.

An officer climbed the stairs to the upper deck. He was tall -- six feet, uniformed, the peaked cap casting a shadow across his face, the shadow making his expression unreadable. He carried the bus manifest in one hand.

"Penumpang kerusi dua puluh dua B." *Passenger seat 22B.*

The upper deck was silent. The passengers had heard the commotion below -- the voices, the dog, the word *positif*. They had felt the bus not moving, had seen the officers through the windows, had registered the change in the atmosphere from routine check to something else, something that generated the specific, electric silence of a group of people witnessing an event they would tell other people about later.

"Seat 22B," the officer said again, in English. "Please come with me."

Connor stood. The standing was the last autonomous act his body would perform -- the last time his legs would lift him from a seat of his own choosing, the last time his muscles would obey the impulse to rise, to move, to participate in the vertical experience of being a person who was free to stand and sit and walk and stop as they wished. From this moment forward, the standing and the sitting and the walking and the stopping would be directed by other people, by the system, by the machinery of enforcement and incarceration and the specific, bureaucratic process that began with a dog sitting beside a suitcase and ended with a sentence delivered by a judge in a courtroom.

He reached for his daypack. The daypack contained his passport, his phone, his water, his blue towel. The officer watched him reach for it. The officer did not stop him. The daypack was not the issue. The suitcase was the issue.

He walked down the aisle. The passengers watched. Forty-three faces, turned toward him, the faces of ordinary people on an ordinary bus witnessing the extraordinary event of a man being removed by police, the event that they would describe to their families tonight -- *there was a mat salleh on the bus, they found drugs in his luggage, they took him off at the checkpoint, he was young, Australian I think, he looked scared* -- the event that would become a story and the story would be told and retold and the details would shift with each telling and the mat salleh would become taller or shorter and the drugs would become more or less and the fear on his face would become more or less visible but the core would remain: a young foreigner, a bus, a suitcase, a dog, and the Malaysian law that treated fifty grams of methamphetamine as a capital offence.

He descended the stairs. Lower deck. The door. The sunlight.

The highway. The shoulder. The cones. The officers. The suitcase, open, the lining cut, the vacuum bags on the ground, the white crystalline substance visible in the clear plastic, the test kit with its blue reagent sitting on the asphalt like a small, decisive piece of evidence that had rendered its verdict in less than a minute.

An officer approached Connor. The officer was professional, calm, the manner of a man performing a procedure he'd performed before. He spoke in English.

"Are you the owner of this suitcase?"

Connor looked at the suitcase. The suitcase looked back. The suitcase that Felix had placed on the bed in the private room. The suitcase that Connor had picked up by its telescopic handle. The suitcase that had rolled across the TBS concourse and been loaded into the luggage compartment by a handler who didn't know and didn't care. The suitcase that had been anonymous and was now the most visible object on the North-South Expressway, surrounded by officers and a dog and the chemical evidence of what it contained.

"Yes," Connor said.

The word was the admission, the confession, the legal foundation upon which everything that followed would be constructed -- the charge, the trial, the sentence. The word was *yes* and *yes* was the word that the system required, the input that activated the process, the key that turned in the lock.

The officer nodded.

"You are under arrest under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 for trafficking in dangerous drugs. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used as evidence. You have the right to legal representation."

The words were formal, recited, the words that officers said because the law required them to say them and the saying was not a courtesy but a procedure, the procedure that transformed a person from a civilian into a suspect, from a passenger into a prisoner, from a man on a bus to a man in handcuffs.

The handcuffs appeared. Steel. The officer took Connor's wrists -- gently, professionally, the wrists of a young man who was not resisting, who was standing on a highway shoulder in Perak in the eleven o'clock sun with the traffic streaming past and the other passengers watching from the bus windows and the dog sitting calmly beside the suitcase and the world continuing, the world absolutely continuing, the sky still blue and the palm oil plantations still green and the highway still carrying vehicles north and south and the world not pausing, not even for a moment, for the arrest of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian who had wanted nothing more than to avoid going home and had found, in a hostel on Petaling Street, a home that was a trap, and in the trap, a suitcase, and in the suitcase, the end.

The handcuffs closed around his wrists. The steel was warm from the sun. The click was small, precise, final.

Connor Briggs was under arrest.

The bus pulled away. The bus continued north, toward Penang, minus one passenger, minus one suitcase, the seat 22B empty now, the daypack gone, the space where Connor had sat returning to its neutral state, ready for the next journey, the next passenger, the next person going somewhere because they chose to.

On the highway shoulder, Connor was placed in the back of a police vehicle. The door closed. The vehicle pulled onto the highway. The vehicle turned south.

Not north, to Penang. South. Back to KL. Back to Dang Wangi.

The checkpoint receded. The cones. The officers. The dogs. The suitcase on the ground with its lining cut and its contents exposed and the blue reagent in the test kit confirming what everyone already knew.

Connor sat in the back of the police vehicle with his hands cuffed in his lap and the blue towel in his daypack and the afternoon light coming through the window and the highway unspooling behind him and the Petronas Towers somewhere ahead, growing larger as the vehicle moved south, the towers that had been his landmark for forty-seven days, the towers that had been behind Felix's silhouette on the first night, the towers that had watched from the skyline as he carried envelopes and packages and backpacks and charger boxes and now a suitcase through the streets of a city that had been beautiful and lethal and patient as stone.

The towers grew larger. The city approached. The story was nearly over.
