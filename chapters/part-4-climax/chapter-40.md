# Chapter 40: 3 AM

The phone rang in Hawthorn at 3 AM on a Tuesday morning.

The phone was the landline -- the one in the hallway, the one that David and Karen Briggs kept because David believed that landlines were reliable and mobile networks were not, the belief of a generation that had grown up with phones attached to walls and retained a loyalty to the technology that had not been updated since 1987. The phone was beige. The phone had a coiled cord. The phone sat on a small table beside a bowl of keys and a photograph of Connor and Megan at the beach, Connor eleven, Megan nine, both squinting against the sun, both gap-toothed, both alive.

The phone rang and the sound of it -- the old-fashioned trill, the mechanical bell rather than the digital chime -- entered the house at 3 AM and travelled through the hallway and up the staircase and into the bedroom where David and Karen slept and the sound woke David first because David had always been a light sleeper and Karen had always slept deeply and the difference in their sleep was one of the many small asymmetries of a marriage that had lasted thirty-one years.

David got up. He went to the hallway. He picked up the phone. The receiver was cold from the night air that leaked through the front door's gaps.

"Hello?"

"Mr. Briggs? Mr. David Briggs?"

"Yes."

"My name is Sarah Chen. I'm calling from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I'm the duty consular officer. I'm calling about your son, Connor."

David's body knew. The body knew before the mind because the body was faster than the mind and the body understood the semiotics of 3 AM phone calls -- the specific, unmistakable frequency of a phone ringing at an hour when phones did not ring unless the reason for ringing was the reason that no parent wanted to hear. The body understood and the body responded: the hand tightened on the receiver, the legs weakened, the chest constricted, the breathing changed.

"What happened?"

"Mr. Briggs, I need to inform you that your son Connor was taken into police custody on Friday, the forty-seventh day of his stay in Malaysia. He was arrested at a police checkpoint in Perak state for possession of a controlled substance."

"A controlled substance." David repeated the words. The words were the words of officialdom, the sanitised vocabulary of a system that converted human catastrophes into administrative language. Controlled substance. The phrase meant drugs. The phrase meant that his son, his twenty-seven-year-old son who he'd driven to soccer practice and helped with homework and sent $2,000 a month to support his gap year -- his son had been arrested with drugs in Malaysia.

"What kind of substance?"

"Methamphetamine. Four hundred and fifty grams. Mr. Briggs, under Malaysian law, this amount triggers the presumption of trafficking under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act."

"Trafficking." The word arrived in David's mind and the mind rejected it the way a body rejected a foreign organ, the incompatibility absolute, the word and the son it described failing to occupy the same conceptual space. Trafficking was a word from newspapers. Trafficking was a word from documentaries that played on SBS late at night. Trafficking was not a word that belonged to Connor Briggs, Hawthorn, Victoria, the boy who wanted to see the world.

"Mr. Briggs, there is more. And I need you to sit down."

David did not sit down. David stood in the hallway of his house at 3 AM in his pyjamas and his bare feet on the carpet and held the beige phone with the coiled cord and waited.

"Connor was found dead in his cell at Dang Wangi district police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. He was found in the early hours of Saturday morning. The official report states that he died by suicide while in custody."

The silence that followed was not the silence of processing. The silence was the silence of cessation -- the cessation of the mechanism by which David Briggs interpreted the world, the mechanism that took input and produced understanding, the mechanism that had been operating continuously for fifty-nine years and had just received an input that exceeded its capacity. The mechanism stopped. The silence was the sound of the mechanism stopped.

Karen appeared at the top of the staircase. She was in her nightgown, her hair disordered from sleep, her face carrying the particular confusion of a person awakened at 3 AM by a sound that should not exist at 3 AM. She saw David. She saw David's face. She saw David's hand on the phone. She saw everything she needed to see in the posture of a man who had received news that had changed the shape of the world, and the change was not an improvement.

"David?"

David looked at her. His mouth opened. No words came. The words that should have come -- *Connor is dead, Karen, our son is dead in Malaysia, they say it was suicide, they say he had drugs, they say he's gone* -- the words were formed but they would not travel from his mind to his mouth because the travel required a bridge and the bridge had collapsed, the bridge between knowing and saying, between the private fact and the shared fact, the bridge that separated a man who knew his son was dead from a couple who knew their son was dead.

Karen descended the staircase. Her hand was on the banister. Her feet were bare. The carpet was the same carpet that Connor had crawled on as a baby, walked on as a toddler, run on as a child, tracked mud on as a teenager. The carpet held the history of the family in its fibres, the accumulated evidence of thirty years of feet.

She reached David. She put her hand on his arm. The hand was warm from the bed. The hand was the hand that had held Connor when he was born, held him when he was sick, held his face when he was twelve and his first girlfriend had broken up with him and he'd come home and sat in the kitchen and cried, and she'd held his face in her hands and said *it'll be okay, darling, it'll be okay*.

"Who is it?" Karen said.

David gave her the phone. He gave it to her because he could not say the words and the phone contained the words and the phone could say them so he didn't have to. He gave her the phone and stepped back and leaned against the hallway wall and felt the wall hold his weight, the wall that he had painted himself, the wall that was the colour Karen had chosen -- "Dulux Antique White, half strength" -- the wall that was part of the house that was part of the life that had just been altered permanently, irreversibly, by a phone call from a woman named Sarah Chen in a city twelve thousand kilometres away.

Karen put the phone to her ear. Sarah Chen repeated the information. The information entered Karen's body through her ear and travelled through the neural pathways and reached the part of her brain that processed language and the language was processed and the processing produced a sound.

The sound was not a word. The sound was not a scream. The sound was something that existed between words and screams, in the territory that language had not mapped because the territory was visited so rarely and by so few. The sound was the sound of a mother learning that her child was dead, and the sound had no name because naming it would have required the kind of clinical distance that the sound made impossible, the sound too large and too raw and too fundamental to be reduced to syllables.

The sound filled the hallway. The sound reached the kitchen, where the Vegemite jar sat on the counter. The sound reached the living room, where the cricket would play again on the weekend. The sound reached the garden, where a man with a phone had stood four days ago and photographed Karen through the window. The sound reached the bedroom, where two pillows held the impressions of two heads that would not sleep again tonight or for many nights after.

David held Karen. Karen held the phone. The phone held the line to Kuala Lumpur. The consular officer held the silence that followed the sound, the silence that consular officers were trained to hold, the silence that was not awkward but necessary, the silence that a person needed to occupy after receiving the information that their child was dead and the death was violent and the death was in a foreign country and the death was described by a word -- *suicide* -- that they did not believe and would never believe because the word did not describe their son, their Connor, the boy who was confident and careless and alive, the boy who was always alive, the boy for whom death was the thing that happened to other people's children, not to theirs, never to theirs.

"We want to bring him home," Karen said.

Her voice was steady. The steadiness was not strength. The steadiness was the body's emergency response -- the system that took over when the regular systems failed, the system that allowed a person to function, to speak, to form sentences, while the deeper systems were in catastrophic failure. The steadiness was the human equivalent of a building's emergency generator -- temporary, limited, insufficient for anything except the basic operations.

"Of course, Mrs. Briggs. The High Commission will assist with the repatriation process. We'll need--"

"We want him home."

The repetition was not for Sarah Chen's benefit. The repetition was for Karen's benefit -- the words spoken aloud as a directive, as an instruction to the universe, as the assertion of a mother's authority over her child's body even when the child was no longer in the body and the body was in a morgue in a city she had never visited and might never visit and the distance between the body and the home was twelve thousand kilometres of ocean and land and air and the bureaucratic infrastructure of two countries that had to cooperate to move the remains of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian from a police morgue in Kuala Lumpur to a funeral home in Hawthorn.

"We'll bring him home," Karen said. "David and I will fly to Malaysia. Today. We'll bring him home ourselves."

"Mrs. Briggs, the process typically takes--"

"Today."

The word was the last word that Karen Briggs would speak with the steadiness of the emergency generator. After the word, the generator would fail, and the deeper failure would surface, and the sound would return -- the sound that had no name, the sound that filled the hallway and the house and the street and the suburb and the city and the night.

David held her. The hallway held them. The house held the hallway. The night held the house. And in the night, in the hallway, in the house in Hawthorn where Connor Briggs had grown up and left and never returned, two people stood together and the standing was the beginning of a grief that would not end, that would persist through the flight to KL and the morgue and the identification and the repatriation and the funeral and the years that followed, the grief that would live in the house the way ghosts lived in buildings, permanent, invisible, altering the atmosphere without being seen.

The phone call ended. The landline was placed back on the table, beside the bowl of keys, beside the photograph of Connor and Megan at the beach.

The photograph was still there. The photograph had not changed. In the photograph, Connor was eleven and gap-toothed and squinting and alive. In the photograph, the sun was shining and the beach was golden and the water was blue and the world was the world of a family on a Saturday at the beach, the world where the worst thing that could happen was sunburn or a lost sandal or the car running low on petrol on the way home.

The photograph would remain on the table. The photograph would be there when Megan arrived, called from her flat in Fitzroy, arriving at 4:30 AM in her pyjamas and a coat, her face carrying the same expression that David's face had carried an hour ago -- the expression of a person whose mechanism had stopped. The photograph would be there when the neighbours came, and the golf club called, and the local paper asked for a comment, and the world that David and Karen had built in Hawthorn was invaded by the world that existed beyond Hawthorn, the world where sons died in foreign police stations and the word *mule* appeared in newspapers and the word was followed by the word *death* and both words were attached to the name Connor Briggs and the attachment was permanent.

At 4:17 PM Malaysian time on Saturday -- sixteen hours after the body was found, thirty-three hours after Connor Briggs walked out of the Lantern Hostel with a black suitcase -- an Instagram account with no profile picture posted a photograph.

The account was @HostelReaper. The account had three posts. The first was a photograph of graffiti on a wall in Chinatown -- the "@HostelReaper" tag with the reaper icon that Connor had photographed on Day 2 and posted to his own Instagram, thinking it was street art. The second was a photograph of a backpack on a bus seat with the caption *Another one packed for the journey. #NoReturn*. The third was a photograph of an empty bunk bed in a hostel dorm -- Bed 7, Dorm 3, The Lantern Hostel -- with a blue towel draped across the pillow and the caption *Bed 7. Dorm 3. The Lantern Hostel, KL. Still warm. #LocalLaw #101Ways #CheckoutIsMandatory*.

The fourth post was new.

The photograph showed a cell. A holding cell. Grey concrete walls, a steel bench bolted to the floor, bars painted institutional green. The cell was empty. The fluorescent light was on. The bench was bare. On the wall above the bench, scratched into the paint, barely visible unless you were looking for it, four letters:

REAPER.

The caption read: *Connor Briggs. 27. Australia. Day 47. Checked out. #LocalLaw #101Ways #MandatoryDeath #TheRulesApply*

The post had no likes. The post had no comments. The post existed in the algorithmic wilderness of Instagram, an account with no followers posting to no audience, the digital equivalent of graffiti on a wall -- a mark made not to be seen but to be left, the compulsion to record, to document, to note the passing of a person through a system that did not note passings.

The post would be found later. Weeks later. By a journalist at The Star who was following the story, who was tracing the @HostelReaper account across the internet, who would discover that the account had posted about twelve deaths in eleven countries over three years, always in hostels, always before the death was publicly reported, always with the hashtag #101Ways and always with the specific, detailed, impossible knowledge of someone who knew the victim's name and bed number and date of death before anyone else did.

The journalist would not identify @HostelReaper. No one would. The account would continue posting. The account would post about the next death, and the next, and the next. The account was the series' thread, the connective tissue between the books, the observer that existed outside the stories and inside them simultaneously, the entity -- person, algorithm, ghost, system -- that watched hostels the way Razak watched his map, that tracked deaths the way deaths tracked victims, that existed in the space between the stories and the silences.

But that investigation was later. That was weeks and months of reporting and dead ends and unanswered questions. That was Part 5. That was aftermath.

This was still Part 4. This was still the day of the death. And on the day of the death, the post existed unnoticed, a digital mark on a digital wall, four lines of text and a photograph and the hashtags that were the account's signature, the account's voice, the account's way of saying: *I saw. I know. I recorded. The checkout is mandatory.*

At Dang Wangi, Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail sat at his desk and read Priya's letter for the third time.

The letter was on his screen. The letter had arrived at 2:15 PM the previous day. The letter had sat in his inbox for seventeen hours while he was in the field, while the night shift ran, while a guard named Hafiz took a forty-minute bathroom break, while a man named Rizal performed the function he had been placed in the cell to perform.

Seventeen hours. The letter had been seventeen hours too late.

Ahmad read the letter and the letter confirmed everything he had suspected for six months. Felix Decker. The Lantern Hostel. Wei's phone repair shop. The supply chain. The contacts. The routes. The schedule. The recruitment of foreign backpackers. The pattern that Ahmad had been tracking through informants and surveillance and the slow, painstaking construction of a case that required evidence, and the evidence had been walking through KL with packages in a daypack for five weeks, and Ahmad had given the evidence his card and the evidence had called twice and said nothing and the nothing was the silence of a man who wanted to speak but could not, and the silence was the last communication Ahmad would receive from Connor Briggs.

He looked at the letter. He looked at the report. The report said suicide. The letter said murder. The space between the report and the letter was the space in which the truth lived, the truth that was not in any document yet but would be, in time, when the investigation that Ahmad was about to initiate worked its way through the evidence -- the guard's absence, the cellmate's background, the towel that should not have been in the cell, the timing that was too convenient, the pattern that matched other deaths in other cells.

Ahmad picked up his phone. He called Razak.

"Encik Razak. This is Sergeant Ahmad. I received your messages. I received the letter from London. I received the photographs from the journalist."

A pause on the line. The pause of a man who had been calling and calling and had finally been answered, the pause of a man who knew that the answering was too late but also knew that too late was not the same as never.

"He's dead," Razak said. Not a question.

"He's dead."

"It wasn't suicide."

"No."

The two men held the line. The line carried nothing for several seconds -- no words, no sounds, just the electronic connection between a police station and a hostel three kilometres apart, the connection that represented the gap between the system that should have protected Connor and the building that had tried to warn him, the gap that was seventeen hours wide and would never be closed.

"I'm opening a murder investigation," Ahmad said. "The evidence from London, from the journalist, from your records -- it's enough to move on Felix Decker's network. I'll need your full cooperation. Yours, the receptionist, the cook, anyone who saw anything."

"You'll have it."

"The investigation will expose the hostel. The arrangement you had with Decker. Your knowledge. Your complicity."

"I know."

"You understand what that means."

"I understand. I've understood since the first mule. Since Nurul. Since I chose money over conscience and the choice cost a girl her freedom and now it's cost a boy his life. I understand, Sergeant. I'm ready."

Ahmad hung up. He opened a new case file on his computer. The case file was the beginning of the investigation, the first document in what would become a stack of documents -- reports, statements, photographs, forensic analyses, phone records, bank records, CCTV footage -- the bureaucratic mass of an investigation that would take months and would result in the arrest of Wei and three of the network's contacts and the issuance of an international warrant for Felix Decker and the prosecution of Guard Hafiz for accepting a bribe and the reopening of the death as a homicide and the identification of Rizal through fingerprint analysis and the eventual, partial, insufficient accounting of what had happened to Connor Briggs in a cell at Dang Wangi on a Friday night in February.

The investigation would be partial because Felix would not be found. Felix would be in Cambodia by the time the warrant was issued. Felix would set up operations in a hostel in Phnom Penh, and the operations would recruit new mules, and the mules would be young and broke and lonely and the recruitment would follow the same pattern -- common room, beer, charm, envelope, package, suitcase -- and the pattern would repeat because the pattern was not Felix's invention but the pattern's own invention, the pattern existing independently of any single operator, the pattern reproducing itself in hostels and guesthouses across Southeast Asia the way a virus reproduced itself in cells, the host dying, the virus moving on.

But that was the future. That was months of police work and legal proceedings and the slow, grinding process of a system responding to its own failure. That was Part 5.

This was Part 4's end.

At the Lantern Hostel, Bed 7 was remade by noon on Saturday.

Mei Ling had stripped the sheets at 8 AM, after Razak's phone call, after the confirmation. She had folded the old sheets and placed them in the laundry bag -- the bag that was collected every Monday by a service that laundered the sheets and returned them fresh and the laundering erased every trace of every body that had slept on every sheet, the industrial cleaning that was the hostel's method of forgetting, the chemical process that converted a specific person's DNA and sweat and skin cells into a generic, clean, unoccupied fabric.

She had remade the bed with fresh sheets. White. The standard hostel white that was the colour of absence, the colour of a surface waiting for an occupant, the colour of potential rather than history.

The bed was ready. The bed was available. The booking system showed: BED 7, DORM 3 -- VACANT.

By Saturday evening, Bed 7 had a new occupant. A French student, twenty-three, backpacking through Southeast Asia on a gap year before starting her master's degree in Lyon. She had booked the bed online for RM45 per night. She arrived at 6 PM with a large backpack and a smile and the particular, luminous confidence of a person who was experiencing Asia for the first time and finding everything extraordinary.

She climbed into Bed 7. She placed her hand on the wooden rail. Her fingers rested on the groove of a letter. She did not look at it. She did not feel it. The letter was L. The next letters were E, N, A.

She lay down. She pulled the hostel sheet over herself -- not a blue towel, not a Sea to Summit microfiber, but the white hostel sheet that was all that was available. She looked at the ceiling. The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

She fell asleep. Above her, through the air well, the stars were not visible -- the city's ambient light erased them, the permanent false dawn of KL's eight million lives generating enough luminosity to render the sky a flat orange-grey. But the stars were there. Behind the glow. Behind the haze. The stars that had been there when the building was built in 1928 and would be there when the building was gone.

The hostel breathed. The building absorbed the new occupant the way it absorbed everything -- silently, completely, without judgement. The building did not remember Connor Briggs. Buildings did not remember. Buildings held space and the space was filled and emptied and filled again and the filling and the emptying was the rhythm of the building's existence, the diastole and systole of a heart made of plaster and timber and tile.

But the name on the bed frame remained. LENA. Four letters. And the name that was not on the bed frame -- CONNOR, five letters -- was absent, and the absence was the only epitaph, the only mark, the only evidence that a man had slept in this bed and carried packages and loved a woman and eaten nasi lemak and looked at the Petronas Towers from a rooftop and called his mother not enough and been afraid and been brave and been neither and been both and been, in the end, gone.

The ceiling fan turned.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

The building breathed.

*End of Part 4: Climax*
