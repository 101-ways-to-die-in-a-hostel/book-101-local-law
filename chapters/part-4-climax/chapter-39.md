# Chapter 39: The Morning After

## I. Ahmad

Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail arrived at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters at 7:32 AM on Saturday morning.

He arrived at 7:32 and not 7:30 because a delivery truck had been double-parked outside the 7-Eleven on the corner, and Ahmad had waited with the patience of a man who had learned, over twenty-three years in the Royal Malaysia Police, that two minutes never mattered.

Except today. Today, the difference between 7:30 PM and 7:30 AM -- the twelve-hour difference, the difference between last night and this morning -- that difference would matter. That difference was the weight that would press against his ribs for years, the weight that all police officers carried from the cases that broke wrong, the cases where the timeline was off by hours, by minutes.

But he did not know this yet. He knew only that it was Saturday morning and the weekend shift was quiet and the day would proceed with the measured rhythm of a Narcotics Division Saturday in a city that saved its drug arrests for weeknights.

He parked, entered through the staff entrance, climbed the stairs to the second floor. The Narcotics Division office was empty -- skeleton crew, neither officer arrived yet. His desk was in the corner, by the window that admitted a parallelogram of morning light, the slow clock of sunlight that was the office's only concession to the natural world.

He sat. He logged in. He opened his email. The inbox contained forty-three messages -- administrative, procedural, the digital silt that accumulated in a government inbox overnight.

He almost missed it.

The email was at position fourteen. It had arrived at 2:15 PM the previous day, a Friday afternoon, the hour when Ahmad had been in the field, at the checkpoint on Jalan Sultan Ismail, conducting the routine operation that had kept him away from his desk since noon. The email was from an address he did not recognise: p.sharma.kcl@gmail.com. The subject line read: *URGENT -- Drug trafficking network operating from Lantern Hostel, Petaling Street -- evidence enclosed.*

Ahmad opened the email. He read the first paragraph.

*Dear Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail,*

*My name is Priya Sharma. I am a British citizen, a fourth-year medical student at King's College London, and I have been staying at the Lantern Hostel, 28 Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur, for the past six weeks. I am writing to provide you with evidence of a drug trafficking operation that has been conducted from this hostel by a German national named Felix Decker, which has resulted in the recruitment and exploitation of at least one person I know personally -- an Australian man named Connor Briggs, 27, who has been used as an unwitting drug mule for approximately six weeks and who is, as of this writing, about to transport a suitcase containing methamphetamine to Penang by bus.*

Ahmad stopped reading. He read the name again. Connor Briggs.

The name was not unfamiliar. The query took three seconds. The context arrived.

Connor Briggs. The Australian. Bukit Bintang checkpoint, six weeks ago. A random stop on the pedestrian stretch near Lot 10. Blue eyes, sun-bleached hair, board shorts, flip-flops, the uniform of the backpacker. Clean -- no substances, no paraphernalia, nothing. But the eyes had been wrong. The eyes had contained the particular quality of fear that Ahmad had learned to read over twenty-three years, the fear not of a clean person being inconvenienced by a police check but of a person who had carried something recently or would carry something soon.

Ahmad had given him his card. "Malaysia is not a game, sir," Ahmad had said. The Australian had nodded the nod of a man who was not listening but performing the gesture of listening. The Australian had taken the card. The checkpoint had continued.

And then the calls. Two calls, weeks later, from a burner phone. The first had gone to voicemail -- nineteen seconds of silence, the silence of a person who had made the call and could not complete it. The second had connected for three seconds. Ahmad had said "Hello?" and heard only breathing before the line disconnected.

Ahmad had noted the calls. Ahmad had waited for a third call that had not come.

And now the email. The email that named the Australian, the network, everything -- the complete operational architecture of a trafficking operation that Ahmad's division had been circling for eighteen months, the operation visible at its edges but invisible at its centre: a hostel on Petaling Street, a German man in a private room, a succession of backpackers who carried packages across a city without knowing what the packages contained.

Ahmad read the entire letter. Six minutes. The letter had the thoroughness of a medical student -- Felix Decker's method of recruitment, the escalation from envelopes to suitcases, Connor Briggs's progression from willing participant to trapped mule, the network's contacts, the final job with 450 grams of methamphetamine concealed in the lining.

The letter had been sent at 2:15 PM on Friday. Ahmad had been in the field. The letter had sat in his inbox for seventeen hours and seventeen minutes.

Ahmad minimised the email. He opened the case management system. He typed "Connor Briggs" into the search field. The system returned one result.

**Case No: DW/NRK/2026/0847**
**Subject: BRIGGS, Connor James**
**Nationality: Australian**
**DOB: 14/03/1999**
**Arrest Date: [Yesterday's date]**
**Arrest Location: North-South Expressway, KM 247, Perak**
**Charge: Possession and trafficking of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine, 450g) under Section 39B, Dangerous Drugs Act 1952**
**Status: IN CUSTODY -- Dang Wangi DHQ**
**Assigned to: Narcotics Division (pending)**

Ahmad stared at the screen. The case was in his system. The arrest had occurred yesterday afternoon while he was in the field. The case had been logged by the highway patrol unit that made the arrest, assigned to his division automatically by the system's routing algorithm, and was sitting in his queue waiting for his attention on Monday morning when the weekend skeleton crew would hand off the intake cases to the divisional officers for processing.

The case was here. The Australian was here. In this building. In a cell downstairs.

Ahmad stood. He picked up the printed copy of the case file from the in-tray where the overnight officer had placed it. He read the file. The file was thin -- the initial arrest report, the evidence log, the processing record. Standard. Clean. The facts: 450 grams of methamphetamine, concealed in a suitcase lining, detected by canine unit at a highway checkpoint, foreign national arrested and transported to Dang Wangi for holding pending formal charges.

He turned to the second page. The second page was the custody log -- the record of the prisoner's time in the holding cells, the handwritten entries that documented the cell assignment, the observations, the shift changes, the guard checks.

The custody log contained seven entries:

1. **15:08** -- Prisoner BRIGGS, Connor James assigned to Cell C-7. Personal effects surrendered. One item retained: travel towel (blue, microfiber). Authorised by Duty Sgt.
2. **18:00** -- Cell check. Prisoner quiet. No issues.
3. **20:00** -- Cell check. Prisoner quiet. No issues.
4. **21:45** -- Prisoner RIZAL BIN YUSOF (assault charge, remanded) assigned to Cell C-7. Two inmates.
5. **22:00** -- Night shift begins. Cell check by Guard Hafiz. Both inmates quiet. No issues.
6. **23:55** -- Guard Hafiz: bathroom break. Duration: 42 minutes.
7. **00:02** -- Guard Hafiz returns. Cell check. Prisoner BRIGGS found unresponsive, suspended from cell door bars by travel towel (blue, microfiber). Emergency services called. Declared dead at scene, 01:05.

Ahmad read entry number seven. He read it again. He read it a third time. The words did not change. The words were the words of a system recording an event in the language of systems -- clinical, procedural, the language that reduced a human death to a sequence of observations documented in the passive voice. *Found unresponsive. Suspended from cell door bars. Declared dead at scene.*

He turned to the third page. The incident report. The report had been filed by the night duty officer, Inspector Kamal, at 02:30 AM.

**INCIDENT REPORT -- Death in Custody**

**Summary: At approximately 00:40 hours, Guard Hafiz returned from a comfort break to discover the prisoner BRIGGS, Connor James, suspended from the horizontal bar of the Cell C-7 door by means of a blue microfiber travel towel knotted around his neck. The prisoner's cellmate, RIZAL BIN YUSOF, reported that he had been sleeping and had not observed the prisoner's actions. Emergency services were called and the prisoner was declared dead at the scene at 01:05 hours. Preliminary assessment: suicide by hanging (self-inflicted ligature strangulation). The prisoner had been arrested earlier that day for trafficking in dangerous drugs (methamphetamine, 450g), a capital offence under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, and was believed to be despondent over the severity of the charges.**

**Classification: Suicide while in custody.**

Ahmad put the report down. He placed his hands flat on the desk, the pressure of the hands against the surface creating the physical anchor that his mind required.

The towel should not have been in the cell.

This was the first wrong thing. Section 14.3 of the Standard Operating Procedures for Prisoner Custody was explicit: *No personal items that could be used as ligatures, weapons, or instruments of self-harm shall be permitted in holding cells.* The SOP had been revised after the 2019 SUHAKAM inquiry into deaths in custody. The towel should not have been in Cell C-7.

The custody log noted that the towel had been retained by the prisoner, *authorised by Duty Sgt.* Authorised. The word was a shield. The word transferred responsibility from the guard who had tossed the towel into the cell to the unnamed duty sergeant who had apparently approved the deviation from protocol. Ahmad noted the absence of the duty sergeant's name. Ahmad noted that the absence was itself a signature -- the signature of a process that had been designed to have gaps, the documentation that documented everything except the thing that mattered.

The cellmate had been released.

This was the second wrong thing. Ahmad checked the custody log again. Entry 4: Rizal bin Yusof, assault charge, remanded, placed in Cell C-7 at 21:45. Ahmad opened the case management system and searched for Rizal bin Yusof. The system returned one result.

**Case No: DW/GEN/2026/3312**
**Subject: RIZAL BIN YUSOF**
**Charge: Assault (Section 323, Penal Code)**
**Status: RELEASED -- 03:15, [today's date]. Released on personal bond, RM500. No charges filed.**

Released at 3:15 AM. Two hours after a man had died in his cell. Released on personal bond for an assault charge that had not been filed. Released in the middle of the night, when releases did not happen, when the processing desk was closed, because releases at three AM required an urgency that assault charges did not possess.

Ahmad sat with this. He sat with the towel and the cellmate and the release and the forty-two-minute bathroom break and the email from Priya Sharma that had arrived at 2:15 PM and sat in his inbox while the hours passed and the night came and the things that happened at night happened.

He knew.

He did not say it. He did not speak it aloud into the quiet of the empty office at 7:48 AM on a Saturday morning. The word that connected the data points was not *suicide*. The protocol violation and the planted cellmate and the paid guard and the middle-of-the-night release pointed to the other word with the convergent precision of lines drawn to a vanishing point.

The knowing was not a revelation but a confirmation -- the final piece of a pattern he had been observing for eighteen months. Mules caught, mules dead in custody, reports that said *suicide*, the system producing silence with the mechanical regularity of a factory.

He checked his phone. Four missed calls from RAZAK -- LANTERN HOSTEL. Timestamped between 3:30 PM and 6:45 PM yesterday -- all during the hours when Ahmad had been in the field with his phone on silent.

He called Razak back. Three rings. The voice that came through was the voice of a man who had not slept.

"Ahmad."

"Encik Razak. You called yesterday. Four times. I was in the field."

"The boy is dead, Ahmad."

"I know," Ahmad said. "I have the report."

"The report says suicide."

"I know what the report says."

A pause. The pause was not empty. The pause was the space between two men who were not saying the thing they both knew, the space that existed in police work between the evidence and the accusation, between the knowing and the proving, between the truth that was obvious and the truth that was admissible.

"I called Hamid yesterday," Razak said. "At three thirty. I told him the boy was in danger. I told him the network had contacts in the station. I told him to protect the prisoner. He said the prisoner was safe. He said you would call me in the morning."

"I am calling you in the morning."

"The morning is too late."

Ahmad did not disagree. He held the phone and looked at the report on his desk and the case management system's entry for Rizal bin Yusof, released at 03:15, no charges filed, and understood that the morning was too late. The events that the morning was supposed to prevent had occurred in the gap between evening and dawn, when the skeleton crew staffed the building and the reduced capacity was not a bug but a feature.

"I have the letter," Ahmad said. "From the British woman. Priya Sharma."

"She sent it before she flew."

"It arrived at two fifteen yesterday. I was not at my desk."

Another pause -- the sound of a man processing the information that the letter had arrived seventeen hours before the death, that the processing speed of a police inbox on a Friday afternoon had been slower than the processing speed of a network that killed people in cells.

"What will you do?" Razak said.

Ahmad looked at the report. The report said *suicide while in custody*. The report was signed by Inspector Kamal. The report was in the system. The report was the official record. The report was the truth that the institution would present to the embassy, to the family, to the media, to anyone who asked what had happened to Connor James Briggs in Cell C-7 at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters.

"I will do my job," Ahmad said.

He ended the call. He opened a new document on his computer.

The typing was slow -- the typing of a man who understood that these words were the beginning of a process that would take months and might result in nothing or might result in everything.

He typed the heading: **INTERNAL MEMORANDUM -- Request for Investigation into Death in Custody, Case No. DW/NRK/2026/0847.**

The cursor blinked. The morning light moved across the desk.

Ahmad began to write.

## II. The Hostel

Uncle Razak put the phone down.

He was standing in the kitchen of the Lantern Hostel, in the narrow galley that Mama Siti had claimed as her domain. The kitchen smelled of coconut milk and sambal and the rendered fat of dried anchovies crisping in a pan -- the morning smells, the building's olfactory pulse.

Mama Siti was at the stove, her back to Razak, stirring rice with the wooden paddle, the hands performing their function with the automatic precision of a woman who had made nasi lemak so many times that the recipe existed in her muscles rather than her memory.

"Siti."

She did not turn. She did not stop.

"The boy," Razak said.

Mama Siti's hands stopped. The stopping was brief -- a pause of perhaps two seconds, the paddle stationary in the rice, the steam rising around her hands. Then the hands resumed. The stirring continued. The rice was stirred.

"I know," she said.

The two words were spoken in the tone of a woman who had known -- not through information but through the older channel that connected her to the building and the building to the people inside it. She had set the plate this morning, the plate that was her system for tracking the living, the simple analogue monitoring of a woman who trusted food over computers, trusted the fundamental transaction between a cook and an eater.

The plate was on the counter. Nasi lemak -- rice, sambal, anchovies, peanuts, egg, cucumber. Set for Connor.

No one came.

The sambal darkened slightly at its edges, the vibrant red deepening to brown-red. The egg cooled. The cucumber wilted. Mama Siti looked at the plate the way she looked at all uncollected plates -- not with surprise but with the expression of a woman who understood that the uncollected plate was testimony, the proof that someone was supposed to be here and was not.

She turned back to the stove. There were other guests. There were always other guests.

Razak left the kitchen. He found Mei Ling at reception.

Mei Ling was already there -- always already there, the desk and the woman existing in a symbiotic arrangement that showed no signs of dissolving. Polo shirt, ponytail, composed.

"Ahmad called me back," Razak said.

"And?"

"The report says suicide."

Mei Ling's expression did not change. The not-changing was itself a response -- the controlled non-reaction of a woman who had expected this and whose preparation consisted of suppressing the reaction the information warranted.

"The bed," she said.

"Yes."

She turned to the reception computer. She navigated to the room allocation matrix. Dorm 3, Bed 7:

**BED 7 -- BRIGGS, Connor J. -- Check-in: [47 days ago] -- Check-out: OPEN -- Status: OCCUPIED**

She changed the status.

**BED 7 -- VACANT**

A single keystroke. The system knew only two states -- occupied and vacant -- and the transition between them was a binary, a switch, the clean digital boundary between someone being here and someone not being here.

She took fresh sheets from the supply cupboard and carried them upstairs, up the narrow 1928 staircase with its walls covered in stickers -- the accumulated decorative sediment of a thousand travellers, names and logos and country flags layered like geological strata.

She reached Dorm 3. The door was open. The dorm was dim, lit only by the red lantern that hung in the centre, the amber semi-darkness that distinguished the Lantern Hostel from the fluorescent dormitories of the budget chains. Eight bunks. Sixteen beds. Twelve occupied, three empty, one about to be emptied.

Bed 7 was a lower bunk, third from the door, against the wall that faced the air well. The bed was made -- Connor's version of made, which was the sheet pulled approximately upward and the pillow placed approximately at the head and the result being approximately the shape of a made bed without the precision of an actually made bed. His things were gone. His daypack, his clothes, his charger, the detritus of a life lived out of a bag -- all of it was in an evidence room at Dang Wangi, catalogued and bagged and tagged with the case number that Ahmad had read on his screen.

Mei Ling stripped the bed. The sheet came away with the soft, tearing sound of fabric detaching from a surface it had been pressed against for weeks. She folded it -- thirds lengthwise, then thirds crosswise -- and placed it in the laundry bag. The pillowcase followed.

The mattress bore the impression of a body -- the subtle depression that forty-seven nights of the same sleeping posture had pressed into the foam. Connor had slept on his side, right side down, knees slightly bent. The mattress remembered this. The foam held the shape even when the pressure was removed, the ghost of a body preserved in the material that had supported it. The impression would fade. The next guest's weight would overwrite it.

Mei Ling placed the fresh sheet on the mattress. She tucked the corners. She smoothed the surface. She stepped back.

The bed was made. The bed was vacant.

On the inner surface of the wooden rail, facing the mattress, a name was carved: **LENA**. Small, shallow letters scratched with a fingernail or a key. The only evidence that another mule had slept in this bed, been recruited by the same German man, carried packages across the same city, been arrested and sent to Kajang Prison.

Connor had not carved his name. He had slept here forty-seven nights and never read the name that was there, never known the bed's history. The only mark he had left was the depression in the mattress, already being erased by the fresh sheet, by the smoothing of Mei Ling's hands -- the hospitality industry's version of forgetting.

Mei Ling picked up the laundry bag. She left the dorm. She closed the door behind her.

---

## III. Felix

On the third floor of the Lantern Hostel, Private Room 1 was empty.

The room had been occupied until 4:00 AM. Mei Ling's paper ledger showed:

**DECKER, Felix -- Private Room 1 -- Check-out: 04:00 -- Forwarding address: NONE -- Balance: PAID IN FULL -- Notes: --**

The last official record of Felix Decker at the Lantern Hostel. Four AM -- an hour when the hostel was dark and the reception desk was unmanned and the only way out was the guest code, the four digits that opened the door onto Petaling Street at an hour when the street belonged to cats and rats and the men who slept in doorways.

The room, when he left it, contained no evidence of his eighteen-month tenancy. Felix had wiped every surface with alcohol-based cleaning wipes -- desk, nightstand, handles, switches, sink, toilet. He had checked under the mattress, behind the headboard, the bathroom drain, the floor for hairs. The room was clean with the particular cleanliness of a professional departure, the deliberate removal of every physical trace.

Over eighteen months, Felix had paid the Lantern Hostel approximately RM65,000 in cash. Uncle Razak had not calculated this number until now, and the calculating produced the particular nausea of a man who understood that the money was clean only in the sense that it had been laundered -- that the hostel had been, for eighteen months, a subsidiary of the network's operational budget.

Felix Decker was gone. The linen shirts were gone. The leather gloves -- the driving gloves that he wore not for driving but for the handling of things that should not carry his fingerprints -- were gone. The professional camera that he had used as a prop, the camera that supported his cover story as a travel photographer, the camera that contained no photographs of travel and many photographs of routes and drop-off locations and the faces of mules and the faces of contacts -- the camera was gone.

Felix was a professional. The pattern was the pattern -- eighteen months at a location, recruit mules from the transient population, operate the supply chain, and when the operation was concluded by a mule's arrest, depart. Sanitise. Relocate. Begin again.

He was, at this moment, in a Grab heading south on the KLIA Expressway. An 8:45 AM AirAsia flight to Jakarta, then Phnom Penh, then wherever the network sent him next. He sat with his single carry-on -- a black Samsonite, immaculate -- and a leather passport holder containing a German passport that was real and a Dutch passport that was not. He did not think about Connor Briggs. Connor Briggs was a resolved variable, an entry in a ledger that Felix did not keep because ledgers were evidence.

There were always more Connors. The backpacker trail produced them with industrial regularity -- the gap-year kids, the digital nomads, the perpetual travellers running from adulthood toward the fiction of freedom. They arrived at hostels with open faces and empty wallets and the belief that the rules were suggestions. Felix found them. Felix befriended them. Felix used them.

The city fell behind. The airport approached. The room that had been his for eighteen months was now a room that was no one's, and Mei Ling would clean it this afternoon, and the cleaning would find nothing, and the nothing was the most damning evidence of all.

---

## IV. Priya

In London, it was 12:47 AM.

Not the 12:47 AM of clubs and night buses. This was the 12:47 AM of exhaustion -- a woman who had flown eleven hours from KL to Heathrow and re-entered a flat that no longer fit, the life she had left as one person and was re-entering as another.

She had showered. She had eaten toast and Marmite, the taste of before. She was in after. The gap was unbridgeable.

She had tried to sleep. Forty minutes. The bed too soft, the room too quiet, the English February air too cold -- everything wrong in the way that home was wrong when the thing you feared was happening twelve thousand kilometres away.

She gave up on sleep. She made tea -- PG Tips, in the mug with the King's College crest, comforting in the diminished, apologetic way that English tea was comforting.

She sat at the small table in the kitchen. She opened her laptop. The inbox contained a response from Tomoko -- brief, precise, confirming receipt and forwarding to The Star. Nothing from Ahmad. Nothing from the Australian High Commission. Nothing from Connor.

She checked WhatsApp. The last message in their conversation:

**Connor:** I will. Love you.

*I will.* The permanent tense of Connor's life -- the future that never became present, the promise always about to be fulfilled and never fulfilled.

She put the phone face-down on the table, then picked it up again. Refreshed her inbox. Nothing. Refreshed again. The compulsive query of a person whose only available action was checking, the only thing she could do from a kitchen in Bermondsey while the man she loved was in a cell twelve thousand kilometres away.

She did not know that Connor was dead. The not-knowing was the mercy that time zones provided -- the eight-hour gap that preserved, for a few more hours, the possibility that the letter had been read, that Ahmad had acted, that the system had worked.

The not-knowing would end at 6:23 AM London time. She would wake and find an email from the Australian High Commission requesting her to call a specific number regarding a matter of consular significance relating to Mr. Connor James Briggs. She would call. A consular officer would ask if she was seated. The voice would say: "I'm calling to inform you that Mr. Connor Briggs was found deceased in police custody at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters in Kuala Lumpur at approximately 12:40 AM local time on Saturday. The initial report indicates suicide."

The phone would fall from her hand. The voice would continue speaking -- resources, counselling, consular assistance -- and Priya would not hear it because she would be standing at the kitchen counter with her head bowed making a sound that was not crying and not screaming but something between the two.

But that was 6:23 AM. This was 12:47 AM. And the not-knowing was the last kindness and the kindness would not last.

---

## V. Tomoko

At 8:15 AM, Kuala Lumpur time, Tomoko Sato sent a second email to The Star.

She was in the common room of the Lantern Hostel -- the Saturday-morning quiet, the ceiling fan turning, CNN muted on the wall, the news cycle not yet including the death of an Australian backpacker in a Malaysian police cell.

Tomoko had not slept. She had learned of the death from Mei Ling, who had learned it from Razak, who had learned it from Ahmad -- the chain of voices passing the fact with the controlled delivery of people who had expected the worst and found that expectation had not lessened the impact.

Tomoko opened her email. She composed the message. The composing was fast -- Tomoko wrote the way she photographed, in sharp, focused bursts, the prose as precise as her framing, each sentence a deliberate capture.

*To: newsdesk@thestar.com.my*
*From: t.sato.photo@gmail.com*
*Subject: UPDATE -- URGENT -- Death in custody, Dang Wangi, foreign national -- evidence of murder*

*To the news editor,*

*This is a follow-up to my email of yesterday (sent 2:16 PM, Friday). The circumstances have changed.*

*Connor Briggs, the Australian national I identified as a drug trafficking victim in my previous correspondence, is dead. He died overnight in a holding cell at the Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters. The official report classifies the death as suicide.*

*He was murdered.*

*The evidence: (1) A personal item that should have been confiscated under standard custody protocol was left in his cell. (2) A cellmate was placed in his cell hours after his arrest and released hours after his death, at 3:15 AM, with no charges filed. (3) The duty guard took an unscheduled 42-minute break during the period in which the death occurred. (4) The drug trafficking network that I documented in my previous email -- the network operated by Felix Decker from the Lantern Hostel, Petaling Street -- has a documented pattern of silencing mules who are arrested. A previous mule died in custody under identical circumstances six months ago (see attached clipping from your own newspaper, page 7, August edition).*

*The prisoner is dead. The report says suicide. He was murdered. The evidence I provided yesterday could have prevented this death if it had been acted upon in time. It was not. The question is why.*

*I have attached an additional sixteen photographs taken this morning, documenting Felix Decker's room (now empty -- he checked out at 4:00 AM), the hostel's records, and the timeline of events as reconstructed from multiple witnesses. The full archive of fifty-nine photographs with metadata remains available at the secure link provided in my previous email.*

*I am available for interview at any time. I will remain in Kuala Lumpur until this matter is resolved.*

*Tomoko Sato*
*Freelance photojournalist*
*Published: Asahi Shimbun, The Guardian, Reuters*

She pressed send. The email joined the queue at The Star's news desk, where the junior editor who had flagged yesterday's email for review and been told to hold it would now find the follow-up and feel the particular chill of a story that had escalated from *a prisoner is in danger* to *the prisoner is dead*.

Tomoko closed the laptop. She sat back on the battered vinyl sofa and looked at the ceiling fan, its dusty blades turning through air that smelled of Tiger Balm, cooking oil, damp wood, and the sweet rot of an old building in the tropics.

Seven years as a journalist had taught her that the story was never the event. The story was the system. The story of Connor Briggs was not a man strangled in a cell -- it was the system that placed a naive backpacker in the path of a trafficking network, the network in the shelter of a hostel, the hostel in the jurisdiction of a police force within the network's reach. The story was the nine hours between a letter arriving at 2:15 PM and a death at 11:15 PM. The story was the inbox that was not checked.

She would write the longer story -- not for The Star, which would publish its own restrained version, but for The Guardian. The story that traced the network from the hostel to the highway to the cell, that named Felix Decker and connected this death to the previous death and the pattern to the system. She would pitch it with the fifty-nine photographs stored on a server in Tokyo, encrypted, backed up, beyond the reach of anyone who might prefer the evidence not to exist.

She thought about Connor Briggs. She had not liked him -- a fact she held without guilt. He had been irritating, reckless, wilfully ignorant. He had dismissed her warnings, called her uptight, reported her photographs to Felix.

And he had been twenty-seven years old. And he had been strangled with his own towel. And the system that should have protected him had failed, and the failure was not an accident but a product.

Tomoko did not cry for stories. She documented. Documentation was her response to grief, the way cooking was Mama Siti's response and filing reports was Ahmad's and cleaning beds was Mei Ling's. Each person processed the death through the function they performed, the work absorbing the feeling the way the building absorbed the death.

She opened her laptop again. She began to write.

## VI. The Bed

In Dorm 3, the ceiling fan turned. The air moved over Bed 7 -- freshly made, white sheet pulled tight, pillow centred. No blue towel. The towel was in an evidence bag at Dang Wangi, catalogued as Item 7 on the property list of a deceased prisoner, no longer a towel but evidence, no longer a possession but the instrument of a death.

The wood held LENA's name and no other. Connor had not carved his mark. The bed would receive the next body and the next, the mattress compressing and decompressing, the sheets changed and changed again, the bed performing its function with the indifference of an object that did not distinguish between its users, did not rank them, did not mourn them.

And downstairs, in the kitchen, the plate of nasi lemak sat on the counter. The rice had cooled. The sambal had darkened. At ten AM, Mama Siti would pick up the plate. She would scrape the food into the bin. She would wash it and stack it with the other plates, and the plate would be used again tomorrow for another guest, the objects of the hostel performing their roles without regard for the people who used them, the objects outlasting the people, the objects remaining when the people were gone.

The hostel absorbed the death the way it absorbed everything. The building had been absorbing things for ninety-eight years -- the textile trade, the occupation, the gambling, the sex trade, the backpackers, the deaths. To every guest who checked in, it was a charming pre-war shophouse with a 7.8 rating on Hostelworld and amazing nasi lemak and lukewarm showers and a rooftop with a view of the Petronas Towers.

The building absorbed Connor Briggs's death and the absorption was complete and the completeness was the horror.

The fan turned. The bed waited.

Bed 7. Dorm 3. The Lantern Hostel. Vacant.
