# Chapter 36: Meanwhile

At 1:07 PM Malaysian time, while Connor Briggs sat in the back of a police vehicle travelling south on the North-South Expressway with his wrists in handcuffs, AirAsia flight D7 2 touched down at London Heathrow Terminal 4.

The aircraft rolled to Gate 23. The seatbelt sign turned off. The cabin filled with the sound of four hundred people simultaneously unbuckling, standing, opening overhead bins, reaching for bags, performing the choreographed chaos of arrival. Priya Sharma, seat 34A, window, waited. She waited because the aisle was blocked and because waiting was what she had been doing for eleven hours and forty-seven minutes, waiting while the aircraft carried her over the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean and the Middle East and Europe, waiting while the Earth turned beneath her and the time zones unwound and the night that had started in Kuala Lumpur became morning over the Arabian Sea and the morning became dawn over England and the dawn was grey, and the journey was the cruelty, because the night had not ended, the night that had begun with nasi lemak and a kiss and a red suitcase in a Grab and the word *embassy* spoken through a car window was still the same night stretched across thirteen hours of sky, and the night was not over, and the things that the night contained were still happening.

She disembarked. She walked through the jetway. She entered Heathrow.

Heathrow was grey. Not the grey of Malaysia's rain clouds -- not the thick, textured grey that preceded tropical downpours. This was the grey of England in February, the grey that was not a weather event but a condition, the permanent, low-frequency grey that sat on the country like a lid, the grey that entered your bones and your mood and your relationship with daylight and made you understand, viscerally, why the British had colonised the tropics.

Immigration. The queue. The e-gates. Priya's British passport scanned. The gate opened. She was home. The word *home* was a physical sensation -- the particular relief of a body re-entering the jurisdiction that protected it, the borders that defined it, the system that recognised it as a citizen rather than a visitor. She was safe. The safety was real and concrete and she could feel it in her shoulders, which dropped, and her jaw, which unclenched, and her hands, which stopped gripping the handle of the red suitcase with the white-knuckled intensity that they'd maintained since KLIA2.

Baggage claim. The carousel. The red suitcase appeared -- dented, scratched, familiar. She grabbed it. She walked through the green channel. Nothing to declare.

She had everything to declare.

In the arrivals hall, she found a Costa Coffee. She ordered a flat white -- the first English coffee in six weeks, the taste of it, after weeks of kopi and teh tarik and the rich, dark, condensed-milk Malaysian brew, startlingly bland, almost apologetic, the coffee of a country that had colonised the coffee-producing world without ever learning to make coffee.

She sat. She opened her laptop. She connected to the airport wifi.

She opened the document. The letter. The letter she had written in Dorm 4 during a sleepless night, the letter that contained everything she knew about Felix Decker and his operation at the Lantern Hostel, the letter that named names and described routes and quantified amounts and provided the timeline of a twenty-seven-year-old Australian man's recruitment and exploitation and destruction.

The letter was addressed to four recipients:

1. Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, Kuala Lumpur
2. Australian High Commission, Kuala Lumpur
3. The Star, Malaysia (news desk)
4. Tomoko Sato (personal email)

Priya read the letter one final time. The reading took four minutes. The letter was thorough -- the thoroughness of a medical student who understood that evidence required specificity, that claims required documentation, that a letter to a police officer needed to be written with the precision of a diagnosis rather than the passion of a plea.

She pressed send.

The email left her laptop and entered the infrastructure of the internet -- the wifi router, the airport's network, the servers, the cables, the routing protocols that carried digital information across the world at the speed of light. The email reached its recipients in less than a second. The email sat in four inboxes -- a police inbox, a diplomatic inbox, a newspaper inbox, a personal inbox -- waiting to be opened, waiting to be read, waiting to activate the responses that each recipient would produce.

The email sat. The inboxes were not checked immediately. Ahmad was not at his desk. The Australian High Commission's consular duty officer was at lunch. The Star's news desk was processing the day's stories. Tomoko was in the common room of the Lantern Hostel, waiting for exactly this email.

Priya closed the laptop. She drank the flat white. She looked at the arrivals hall -- the grey, the crowd, the Englishness of it all. She looked at her phone. No messages from Connor. No missed calls. The silence from his phone was not unusual -- Connor's relationship with his phone was intermittent, the phone used for Instagram and texts to his mother and the burner phone's instructions and not much else. The silence could mean he was at the embassy. The silence could mean he was safe.

The silence could mean other things. Priya did not allow herself to think about the other things. Not yet. Not in the arrivals hall of Heathrow, with the flat white and the grey light and the letter sent. Not yet.

She stood. She collected the red suitcase. She walked to the Piccadilly Line entrance. She would go to her flat in Bermondsey. She would shower. She would call her parents in Ealing. She would wait for a response to the letter. She would wait for Connor to call.

She descended into the Underground. The escalator carried her down. The warm, stale air of the Tube rose to meet her -- the ancient, particular smell of the London Underground, the smell of brake dust and electricity and the accumulated breath of a million daily passengers. The smell of home.

The smell of a city twelve thousand kilometres from a cell where a man she loved was sitting under a fluorescent light with a blue towel around his shoulders, waiting for a morning that would not save him.

---

At 2:15 PM Malaysian time, Tomoko Sato opened Priya's email on her laptop in the common room of the Lantern Hostel.

She read it quickly. The reading took two minutes. The letter confirmed what Tomoko already knew -- the facts, the names, the amounts, the timeline. The letter was the text that accompanied Tomoko's photographs, the narrative that gave context to the images she had been collecting since her second week at the hostel, the images that were stored on a server in Tokyo, backed up and encrypted, the images that showed Felix Decker entering and exiting Wei's phone repair shop, that showed Connor carrying packages, that showed the digital scale through Wei's window, that showed the operational infrastructure of a drug trafficking network operating out of a hostel in Chinatown.

Tomoko closed the email. She opened her own email client. She had a draft prepared -- a draft she had been refining for three weeks, the draft of an email to the news desk of The Star, Malaysia's largest English-language newspaper. The email contained:

1. A summary of her findings
2. Twelve photographs with metadata
3. A link to a secure folder containing an additional forty-seven photographs
4. The names Felix Decker, Wei, and the Lantern Hostel
5. A reference to Priya's letter as corroborating documentation

She added a line to the email: *The mule -- Connor Briggs, Australian -- was arrested today on the North-South Expressway. He is currently in custody. Time is critical.*

She pressed send.

The email left the hostel's wifi and joined the digital stream. The email reached The Star's news desk at 2:16 PM. The email sat in a queue behind thirty-seven other emails. The queue would be processed by a junior editor named Aisha who was currently at the mamak stall next to the newspaper's offices, eating roti canai and drinking teh tarik, unaware that the email in her queue would become the most significant piece of investigative journalism her desk had handled in six months.

Tomoko closed her laptop. She looked around the common room. The common room was empty -- the afternoon lull, the time between checkout and the evening social hour. The ceiling fan turned. The red lanterns glowed. The building was quiet.

She went to reception. Mei Ling was there.

"The letter has been sent," Tomoko said.

Mei Ling nodded. The nod was small, contained, the nod of a woman who had been waiting for this moment and was now processing its arrival not with relief but with the complicated, ambivalent emotion of a person who understood that the letter's sending was the beginning of a process that would expose not just Felix's network but the hostel's complicity, not just the handler but the building that had housed him, not just the crime but the arrangement that had allowed the crime to occur.

"Uncle Razak?" Tomoko asked.

"Upstairs. He's been on the phone all day. Calling Ahmad. Calling his lawyer. Calling people." Mei Ling paused. "He couldn't reach Ahmad."

"Ahmad's not answering?"

"The desk says he's out. Field work. He'll be back in the morning."

The morning. The word again. The word that had been the answer to every question Connor had asked in the cell -- embassy tomorrow, lawyer tomorrow, Ahmad tomorrow. The word that was the system's temporal boundary, the line between the night and the action, the line that everything depended on.

Tomoko looked at the clock behind reception. 2:23 PM. The morning was seventeen hours away.

"Is that enough time?" she asked.

Mei Ling looked at her. The question was not about time. The question was about whether the system -- the letter, the photographs, the records, the people who had assembled the evidence and sent it through the channels and were now waiting for the channels to process it -- whether the system could deliver its output before a different system, the system that Felix controlled, the system that silenced mules who talked, delivered its own output.

"I don't know," Mei Ling said.

The honesty was not comforting. The honesty was the honesty of a woman who had worked in a building where things happened that she could not prevent, where warnings were issued and ignored and the ignoring led to consequences that the warnings had predicted. The honesty was the honesty of a woman who had filed checkout forms for guests who had left the building alive and who had filed other forms for guests who had not.

Tomoko went back to the common room. She sat on the sofa. She opened her laptop. She checked her email. No response from The Star. No response from Priya. No response from anyone.

The ceiling fan turned. The common room was quiet. The hostel waited.

At 3:30 PM, Uncle Razak called Dang Wangi for the fourth time.

"I need to speak to Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail. Narcotics Division. It's urgent."

"Sergeant Ahmad is not available. He will be in the office tomorrow morning."

"Tomorrow morning may be too late. There is a prisoner in your custody -- an Australian man, Connor Briggs, arrested today on the North-South Expressway with methamphetamine. I have information relevant to his case. Information about the trafficking network. Names. Evidence."

"I can take a message, encik."

"A message is not enough. I need to speak to someone in Narcotics tonight. The prisoner is in danger."

"In danger, encik?"

"The network he was working for has contacts within the police. The prisoner will be silenced if he is not protected. I am telling you this on the record. My name is Razak bin Abdullah. I own the Lantern Hostel, 28 Jalan Petaling. I have information. I need to speak to someone tonight."

A pause. The pause was the pause of a desk officer receiving information that exceeded his authority to process, the information that required a decision by someone above him in the chain of command, the decision that would determine whether the call was escalated or filed.

"I will transfer you to the duty officer."

Hold music. The hold music was a tinny, synthesised version of a Malay folk song, the kind of music that played in government offices and call centres and the telephonic limbo of institutions that operated on their own schedule regardless of the urgency of the caller's need.

The hold lasted four minutes. Then: "Duty Officer, Sergeant Hamid."

Razak repeated everything. The names. The evidence. The danger. The request for protection.

Sergeant Hamid listened. Sergeant Hamid was not Ahmad. Sergeant Hamid was a duty officer on a Friday afternoon, processing calls, managing the station's operational queue, allocating resources based on the station's priorities. The station's priorities on a Friday afternoon were: the evening operations, the Changkat Bukit Bintang patrol, the immigration checks, the traffic operations. A hostel owner's claim that a prisoner was in danger was a claim that required verification, investigation, the involvement of the relevant division -- Narcotics, Ahmad's division -- and the relevant division was unavailable until morning.

"I have noted your call, Encik Razak. I will ensure Sergeant Ahmad receives the message first thing in the morning. The prisoner is in our custody and is safe."

"You don't understand--"

"The prisoner is in our custody, encik. He is safe. Ahmad will contact you in the morning. Selamat petang."

The line went dead.

Razak put the phone down. He was in his office, behind reception, the door closed. The map of deaths was on the wall. The red pins. The newspaper clippings. The collected record of guests who had died in hostels and guesthouses, the record that he had maintained for seventeen years with the obsessive attention of a man who believed that documentation was a form of prevention, that recording the pattern was the first step to breaking it.

The pattern was not broken. The pattern was repeating. The pattern was a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in a cell at Dang Wangi, and the system that should have protected him -- the letter, the photographs, the phone calls, the evidence that had been assembled by a British medical student and a Japanese journalist and a Malaysian hostel owner and a receptionist and a cook -- the system had delivered its inputs and the inputs were in queues and the queues were being processed at the speed of bureaucracy, which was the speed of humans working within institutions, which was the speed of morning, which was tomorrow.

Tomorrow. Seventeen hours. The night shift had started at Dang Wangi. One guard for the cell block. The guard would check every hour. Maybe.

Razak looked at the map. He looked at the space where Kuala Lumpur was. He looked at the red pins that already existed in the city -- three, from previous years, previous hostels, previous deaths. He did not have a pin for the Lantern Hostel. He had never placed a pin for his own building. The absence of a pin was the thing he had been guarding for thirty years, the clean record, the building that hosted and released, that checked guests in and checked them out, that did not appear on the map of the dead.

He sat in his office. He looked at the map. The map looked back.

And in a cell at Dang Wangi, three kilometres away, a man wrapped in a blue towel was lying on a steel bench while a man named Rizal sat across from him and the fluorescent light buzzed and the night shift guard settled into his chair and put in his earbuds and opened his phone and began the long, quiet process of not paying attention to the things that happened in cells during the hours when no one was watching.

At 4:45 PM, in Melbourne, Australia, Karen Briggs was making dinner.

She was in the kitchen -- the kitchen in Hawthorn, the kitchen with the yellow curtains and the Vegemite jar and the window that overlooked the garden. The garden where, unbeknownst to her, a man with a phone had stood two days ago and photographed her through the glass.

She was making a shepherd's pie. David's favourite. David was in the living room watching the cricket, his health improved, his colour better than it had been for weeks, the scare of two months ago receding into the category of things that had been frightening but were now manageable. The cricket was Australia versus India, a Test match at the MCG, and David was calling out the scores in the way that men called out cricket scores to kitchens -- assuming the kitchen was interested, assuming the kitchen was listening, the monologue of a man speaking to a room.

Karen was listening. She was also thinking about Connor.

She thought about Connor most evenings. The thinking was not anxious -- not the acute, focused anxiety of a mother who suspected something specific. The thinking was the background radiation of a mother whose child was far away, the low-frequency concern that lived in the base of the skull and activated at quiet moments, at the moments between tasks, at the moments when the hands were busy with a pie but the mind was free to wander and the wandering took it to KL, to the hostel she'd seen on Instagram, to the face of her son in the photographs he posted -- the sunburn, the smile, the settings that she couldn't identify but that looked warm and bright and far from Hawthorn.

*Are you eating well? Please call soon.*

She had sent the text days ago. He had replied. He had said he'd call Sunday. He had not called Sunday. The not-calling was not unusual -- Connor's relationship with phone calls was the relationship of a generation that texted rather than talked, that communicated in captions rather than conversations. The not-calling worried her in the way that all of Connor's absences worried her, which was mildly, constantly, the worry of a woman who had raised a child to be independent and was now experiencing the consequence of that independence, which was distance.

She put the shepherd's pie in the oven. She set the timer. She wiped the counter. She looked at the kitchen clock. Four forty-five PM in Melbourne was 1:45 PM in KL -- she had learned the time difference, had memorised it the way mothers memorised the things that connected them to absent children, the eight-hour gap that placed Connor's morning in her evening and his evening in her morning, the temporal distance that was smaller than the physical distance but felt larger because it meant they were never in the same part of the day.

She did not know that her son was in a cell. She did not know that the cell was at Dang Wangi. She did not know that the cell contained a man named Rizal who was not in for a bar fight. She did not know that the blue towel she had packed in his bag eighteen months ago at this very kitchen counter, folding it carefully, placing it in the side pocket, saying "Don't forget sunscreen" -- she did not know that the towel was in the cell with him, that the towel would be the last thing he felt, that the towel she had packed was the instrument that had been placed in the cell for a purpose that was not comfort.

She put the kettle on. She would make tea. She would sit with David. She would watch the cricket. She would wait for Sunday, when Connor had promised to call, and Sunday would come, and the call would not, and the not-calling would shift from mild concern to something else, something that arrived the following Tuesday at 3 AM Melbourne time as a phone call from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, a phone call that began with the words "Mrs. Briggs, I'm calling about your son Connor" and ended with a sound that Karen would never forget, the sound of a mother learning the thing that no mother should learn, delivered in the measured, professional tone of a consular official who had made this kind of call before and would make it again and had been trained to deliver the information in a specific way that was clear and compassionate and completely, utterly insufficient.

But that was Tuesday. This was Friday. And on Friday at 4:45 PM, Karen Briggs put the kettle on and waited for it to boil and thought about her son in the mild, constant way of mothers everywhere, and the kitchen was warm, and the cricket was on, and the shepherd's pie was in the oven, and the world was ordinary, and the ordinary was a mercy that would not last.

At 10:00 PM Malaysian time, in the cell at Dang Wangi, the night shift guard completed his first round.

The guard's name was Hafiz. He was twenty-six. He had been in the PDRM for three years, assigned to Dang Wangi for eighteen months, assigned to the night shift for the past six because the night shift was where junior officers were placed, the hours that senior officers avoided, the shift that ran from ten PM to six AM and required the ability to stay awake through the quietest hours of a building that spent its nights in a state of reduced animation, the cells occupied, the corridors empty, the sounds muffled.

Hafiz walked the cell block. Eight cells. Three occupied. Cell 1: a Malaysian man arrested for assault, sleeping. Cell 3: two men arrested for theft, one sleeping, one staring at the ceiling. Cell 7: two men -- a foreigner, Australian, arrested for drug trafficking, lying on the bench wrapped in a towel; and a Malaysian man, bar fight, sitting on the opposite bench, awake.

Hafiz looked through the observation slot of Cell 7. The foreigner was lying down. The Malaysian was sitting. Both were still. Hafiz noted the observation on his log -- a paper log, the physical record that the system required, the handwritten entry that would later be examined by investigators and journalists and lawyers as evidence of what had happened and when.

*22:00 -- Cell 7: Two inmates. Quiet. No issues.*

Hafiz returned to the duty desk. The desk was at the end of the corridor, separated from the cells by a steel door and a short hallway. From the desk, the cells were not visible -- the corridor turned, the architecture of the building placing a wall between the guard and the prisoners, the wall that was a design flaw or a design feature depending on who was doing the assessing.

Hafiz sat at the desk. He put in his earbuds. He opened his phone. He had eight hours until the end of his shift. Eight hours of cells and logs and the corridor and the desk and the fluorescent light and the silence.

He pressed play on a video. The video was a football highlights compilation. The sound of the crowd and the commentator's voice filled his ears. The cells were quiet. The building was quiet. The night was long.

At 10:47 PM, his phone buzzed. A message from a number he didn't recognise.

*Cell 7. Bathroom break. 40 minutes. RM5,000.*

Hafiz looked at the message. The message was clear. The message was an instruction. The message was accompanied by, he discovered when he opened his banking app, a pending transfer of RM5,000 from an account he didn't recognise.

He looked at the corridor. He looked at the cells. He looked at the message.

RM5,000 was two months' salary. RM5,000 was the deposit on the flat his girlfriend had been asking about. RM5,000 was the answer to a question that the night shift's salary did not provide.

At 11:15 PM, Guard Hafiz stood from the duty desk. He walked past the cells. He did not look through the observation slots. He opened the door at the end of the corridor. He walked through. The door closed behind him.

The cell block was unguarded.

In Cell 7, Rizal heard the door close. He heard the silence that followed -- the specific, complete silence of a space that was no longer watched, no longer attended, the silence that was not empty but loaded, the silence that preceded action.

Rizal stood.

The fluorescent light buzzed.
