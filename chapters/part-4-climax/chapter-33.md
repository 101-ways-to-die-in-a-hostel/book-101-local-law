# Chapter 33: The Hours

Forty minutes had passed -- approximately, because the cell had no clock and Connor's phone was in a plastic bag somewhere beyond the locked doors, and the fluorescent tube on the ceiling operated outside of time, its light the same at noon and midnight. Forty minutes, and already the cell had ceased to be a room and become a world -- three metres by three metres of grey concrete and steel and the tube's unwavering hum, the world reduced to its constituent elements, the elements indifferent to the man sitting among them. The bench's cold had reached his bones. The cold was not air-conditioning cold but steel cold, the cold of a material that conducted heat away from the body faster than the body could produce it, the cold that would never warm because the steel's thermal mass was greater than his body's thermal output, the steel always winning.

He had his towel -- the blue Sea to Summit microfiber draped across his shoulders like a shawl, the only object the guard had not sealed in the plastic evidence bag, the towel that still smelled of sunscreen and salt and the life that had existed before the cell.

---

The panic came at approximately the one-hour mark.

One moment Connor was sitting on the bench with the towel around his shoulders, his mind operating in the numb, post-adrenaline state that had insulated him since the highway, the state that had gotten him through the processing and the fingerprinting and the questions that he had answered with the monosyllabic compliance of a man operating on autonomic function rather than conscious will. The next moment the insulation failed.

The insulation failed and the information arrived.

Four hundred and fifty grams. Section 39B. Fifty grams triggered the presumption. He had nine times the threshold. Not two times, not three times, not a marginal overage that a lawyer might argue down, but nine times -- 450 divided by 50, the mathematics simple, the mathematics devastating, the mathematics producing a number that was not a number but a verdict, that was not arithmetic but law, that was not quantity but category, the category being trafficking, the category being mandatory, the category being death.

Mandatory. The word was worse than the number because the number was abstract -- a quantity, a measurement, a value on a scale -- but the word was absolute. Mandatory. Not discretionary. Not recommended. The word that meant the judge had no choice and the system had no flexibility and the human being in the dock had no appeal to mercy because mercy had been removed from the formula in 1952 when the drafters of the Dangerous Drugs Act decided that the punishment would be death and the death would be mandatory and mandatory would mean mandatory.

And then the third word arrived, and it arrived not in the mind but in the body -- in the chest, in the gut, in the legs, in the hands wrapped in the blue towel. Death. The word bypassed cognition entirely and landed as contraction, as the sudden, involuntary tightening of every muscle group simultaneously, the body's total mobilisation against a threat it could not distinguish from a predator, from a charging animal, from the jaws of a beast. The body recognised death. The body had evolved to recognise death. The body's response was the oldest response, the response that predated language and law and the specific human invention of killing people with words spoken in courtrooms.

The phrase that Priya had said to him on the rooftop -- how many days ago? Twenty? Twenty-five? *Connor, the mandatory death penalty. Do you understand what mandatory means? It means there's no discretion. It means if you're caught with over fifty grams, the judge has to sentence you to death. Has to. It's not optional.*

He had kissed her. He had kissed her because kissing was easier than listening and listening would have required action and action would have required the dismantling of the machine and the machine had not been ready to be dismantled, not on the rooftop with the Petronas Towers glittering and the woman beautiful and the words just syllables, just sounds bouncing off the surface of his denial and falling like stones thrown at a wall.

Now the wall was gone. Now the stones were inside.

His breathing doubled in the space of three breaths. The sound was loud in the cell -- the concrete walls and the steel bench amplifying and returning every sound, the breathing becoming an echo of itself, producing the sensation that the cell was breathing with him, that the walls were expanding and contracting in rhythm with his lungs. The three metres compressed to two, to one, the ceiling lowering, the floor rising, the cell shrinking around him with the inexorable pressure of a vice. He stood -- the primate's instinct to make itself larger in the face of threat. He paced. Three steps to the bars. Three steps to the wall. The rubber sandals -- his Birkenstocks had been confiscated -- slapped on the concrete, slap-slap-slap, a metronome, and at each turn the wall appeared and the wall reminded him of the phrase and the phrase reminded him of the breathing and the breathing accelerated and the pacing accelerated and the acceleration was the spiral, the feedback loop, the system feeding on its own output, the loop with no circuit breaker, no mechanism for interruption except exhaustion, which would come when the body's reserves of adrenaline and cortisol were depleted and the fire burned itself out because there was nothing left to burn.

Three steps. Turn. Three steps. Turn. The bars. The wall. The bars. The wall.

Mandatory death penalty.

The phrase was stuck, the needle in the groove, each repetition adding weight until the three words were not words but architecture, the walls and ceiling and floor of a room more confining than the cell because the cell was temporary but the phrase was the law, and the law was permanent.

---

The denial arrived the way all biological defences arrived -- automatically, without conscious activation.

The machine. The old rationalisation engine, dormant since the highway, since the handcuffs. Now the machine rebooted.

*Maybe they'll see I'm just a mule.* The thought arrived warm -- judges had eyes, prosecutors had judgment, the system had to have room for the difference between Felix Decker, who orchestrated, and Connor Briggs, who carried.

*Maybe the embassy will intervene.* The Australian embassy. The consular services that existed for exactly this -- for the moment when an Australian citizen was in trouble abroad, when the passport that Connor had carried through twelve countries would exert its power, the power of citizenship, the power of the nation behind the passport. The embassy would send someone. The embassy would provide a lawyer. The embassy would contact Canberra. Canberra would contact Kuala Lumpur. The diplomatic channels would open and the channels would carry the message: *this is one of ours, this is an Australian, this is a boy from Hawthorn, and we do not leave our people to die in foreign prisons.*

*Maybe there's a deal.* He knew things. He knew names. Felix Decker. Wei. Mr. Tan, the man above Wei, who controlled the Petaling Street corridor. Auntie Lim at the packaging house in Sentul. Danny at the apartment in Brickfields. Ah Keat, the man with the scar on his neck who never spoke. He could describe the routes, the schedule, the pickup points and the drop points, the packaging at Wei's shop, the back room with the vacuum sealer and the scale and the heat gun. He could draw the network on a whiteboard. He was valuable. A cooperating witness was valuable. The police wanted the network, not the mule. The mule was the leaf and the network was the root and the police wanted the root. That was how it worked in every jurisdiction, in every procedural he'd ever half-watched -- the small fish traded the big fish and the system forgave the smallest fish to get the biggest.

*Maybe Felix was bluffing about the system being rigged.* This one was tissue-paper thin. Felix had bluffed about the money (it was less), the risk (it was more), Connor's safety (there was none). Maybe he'd bluffed about the reach, about the ability to silence witnesses in police custody.

The rationalisations held for approximately twelve minutes. He counted by the pacing -- four circuits per minute, steps as seconds, turns as tick marks, the cell as the dial.

Then they did not hold because the cell was still the cell and four hundred and fifty grams was still four hundred and fifty grams and the machine could produce hope but hope was not law and the law was what determined what happened next. Section 39B. Mandatory death penalty.

The rationalisations collapsed. And what was beneath them, what had been beneath every structure the machine had ever built, was terror. The pure, unprocessed terror of a man who was going to die and who knew it and who could not make the knowing stop.

---

He asked for things.

The asking was the third phase -- after the panic, after the denial. The asking was the phase of action, of doing, of reaching outward instead of cycling inward, the mind recognising that the internal resources were exhausted and the external resources were the only resources remaining.

He went to the bars. The bars were steel, painted green, vertical, spaced approximately ten centimetres apart, the gap between them sufficient to see through but insufficient to pass through, the gap that was the cell's only interface with the outside world, the aperture through which light and sound and air moved in and out but Connor did not.

The corridor was empty. No officer visible. The corridor extended to the left and right, grey concrete, lit by the tubes overhead, identical to the cell in its materials and its atmosphere, the corridor a larger version of the cell or the cell a smaller version of the corridor, the architecture of confinement scaling from the individual to the institutional, from the three-by-three-metre box to the building that contained it.

"Hello?" he said.

His voice was strange. His voice had not spoken for -- how long? An hour? Two hours? The voice that emerged was not the voice of Connor Briggs, not the voice that said *mate* and *legend* and *she'll be right*, not the voice that was confident and breezy and shaped by the suburbs of Melbourne and the hostels of Southeast Asia. The voice that emerged was thin. High. The voice of a man whose vocal cords were constricted by the same muscles that had been constricted by the panic, the throat tight, the airway narrow, the voice produced under compression, the sound squeezed through a passage that was too small for it, the voice that was the acoustic equivalent of the cell -- confining, restricted, the minimum space for the minimum sound.

"Hello? I need -- can I call the embassy? The Australian embassy."

The corridor did not respond. The fluorescent light hummed. The disinfectant smell persisted, the smell that had been present since he'd entered the cell, the smell that was the smell of cleanliness imposed on a space that was not clean but sanitised, the distinction being that cleanliness was the absence of dirt and sanitisation was the chemical suppression of what the dirt contained, and the chemical suppression did not remove the dirt but masked it, the way the fluorescent light did not remove the dark but replaced it.

"Hello?"

Footsteps. The footsteps came from the left, from the direction of the processing area, from the part of the building where the desks were and the computers were and the officers sat and did the work that officers did -- the paperwork, the phone calls, the data entry that transformed the physical fact of an arrest into the digital record of a case. The footsteps were unhurried. The footsteps were the footsteps of a man who was not responding to an emergency but to an interruption, the pace of a person who would arrive when they arrived and not before.

An officer appeared. Not the young officer who had processed him -- a different officer, older, forties, the rank insignia on his shoulder indicating a corporal, the face carrying the expression of a man who had worked the holding cells for years and had heard every request and every plea and every demand from every person who had ever occupied these cells and had developed, over those years, the particular professional neutrality that came from hearing the same things repeated by different mouths in different accents but always with the same underlying note, which was desperation.

"I need to call the Australian embassy," Connor said.

The officer looked at him. The look was brief, evaluative, the look of a man assessing a situation and determining the appropriate response. The response was not hostile. The response was not sympathetic. The response was institutional.

"Tomorrow," the officer said. "Consular access during office hours."

"But I have the right -- I was told I have the right to contact my embassy. The officer at the checkpoint said --"

"Tomorrow."

The word was a wall. The word was concrete. The word was the same material as the cell walls -- hard, grey, impermeable. Tomorrow. Not now. Not tonight. Tomorrow. The word contained within it the entirety of the night that stretched ahead, the hours between now and the morning, the hours during which the fluorescent light would hum and the cell would be three metres by three metres and the words *mandatory death penalty* would circle like birds that could not land.

"Can I have a lawyer? I need a lawyer."

"Lawyer will be arranged. Tomorrow."

Tomorrow. The word again. The word that answered every question with the same answer. Tomorrow the embassy. Tomorrow the lawyer. Tomorrow the things that the system owed him, the rights that the officer at the checkpoint had recited -- the right to remain silent, the right to legal representation, the rights that existed in the recitation but not in the implementation, the rights that were spoken at the moment of arrest and then stored, deferred, filed under *tomorrow*, the tomorrow that was always one day away and might always be one day away.

"Can I have some water?"

The water request was different. The water request was not legal, not institutional, not about rights. The water request was biological. The body needed water. The body had not had water since the bottle at Tapah, which was five or six hours ago -- the Mamee noodle snacks and the bottle of water that he'd consumed standing in the service area parking lot, the last meal and the last drink of a free man, consumed under a sky that was open and blue and without a ceiling.

The officer nodded. The nod was small, the nod of a man granting a request that was within his authority to grant, a request that required no paperwork and no supervisor and no *tomorrow*. Water was not a right that needed to be scheduled. Water was water.

The officer left. The footsteps receded. The corridor was empty again. The light hummed.

Three minutes later -- three circuits of the cell, twelve steps each circuit, thirty-six steps total -- the officer returned. He passed a plastic cup through the gap in the bars. The cup was white, opaque, the kind of cup that was stacked in dispensers beside water coolers in offices and waiting rooms and the public areas of institutional buildings. The cup was full. The water was warm -- not heated but not cool, the ambient temperature of water that had been sitting in a pipe or a tank in a building where the air conditioning cooled the air but not the plumbing.

Connor took the cup. He drank. The water tasted of pipes. The water tasted of the building's plumbing -- the metallic, faintly mineral taste of water that had travelled through old pipes, the taste that was not exactly bad but was not exactly water, was not the clean, neutral taste of the bottled water he'd been drinking for forty-seven days but the taste of infrastructure, of the system's pipes carrying the system's water to the system's prisoners. The water tasted of the institution. The water tasted of where he was.

He drank it all. He held the empty cup. The cup was the second object in the cell -- the first being the towel, the third being himself. Three objects. A man, a towel, a cup. The inventory of a life reduced to its minimum components.

He put the cup on the bench. He sat beside it. The bench was still cold. The towel was still on his shoulders. The strip light still hummed.

Tomorrow.

---

He thought about his parents.

The thinking was not a choice. The mind, denied new input, turned to its archive. The archive was memory. The memory was home.

His mother first. Karen Briggs. Her last text was on the phone in the evidence bag: *Are you eating well? Please call soon. Love Mum xxx.* Seven words and three kisses, the minimum unit of a mother's worry, calibrated over four years to the precise dosage that would not drive him further away. *Please call soon.* He could not call. His phone was in a bag on the other side of a locked door and the locked door was the boundary between the person he had been -- a person who could pick up the phone and say *I'm fine, Mum, don't worry* -- and the person he now was. She was in Hawthorn right now -- the kitchen, probably, a cup of tea, the phone on the table, wondering if the silence meant he was busy or happy or simply the usual Connor silence that four years of Southeast Asian travel had acclimatised her to. She didn't know. The not-knowing was the only mercy the universe was offering, the mercy that protected her from the knowledge that her son was in a cell and the charge was capital and the word *mandatory* meant what the word meant, and the penalty meant her son, her boy, the child she had carried and raised and watched grow tall and tan and confident and entitled and ignorant and doomed.

His father. David Briggs. The large hands, the firm handshake, the voice of a man who built things and believed problems were solved by competent people making competent decisions. His father's hand on Connor's shoulder at Tullamarine Airport, four years ago -- the last physical contact, the hand heavy with unspoken fear, the hand of a man who knew his authority would not extend to wherever his son was going. *The rules don't care who you are.* His father had said that at the gate, and it was the same thing Priya had said on the rooftop and Tomoko on the staircase and Mama Siti in the kitchen and Ahmad at the checkpoint. The rules that did not care that Connor was Australian. The rules that did not care about his Instagram followers or his compass tattoo or the particular, cultivated casualness that was his armour against the world, the armour that had deflected every warning and every truth and every attempt by the people who loved him to tell him that the armour was not real, that the casualness was not protection. Every person who had ever told Connor Briggs that the rules applied to him had been right and he had been wrong and the wrongness was total and the wrongness was the cell and the cell was three metres by three metres.

He thought about Priya. She was in the air -- somewhere over the Indian Ocean, the flight path from KL to London crossing the same latitudes the British had once crossed in the opposite direction, the brown woman flying home from the country the white empire had administered and the white man sitting in a cell in the country the empire had left. She was carrying a letter addressed to Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail that described what she knew about Felix Decker and the network, the deliveries she had observed with the analytical eye of a medical student trained to derive diagnoses from symptoms. The letter, combined with Tomoko's photographs and Mei Ling's records and Razak's folder, might shift Connor's status from trafficker to witness. But the letter was travelling at nine hundred kilometres per hour at twelve thousand metres, and the ground was where the cell was, and the distance was measured not in kilometres but in hours -- the hours until Priya landed, until the letter entered the system, until the system decided whether a letter from a British-Indian medical student changed things or simply joined the pile marked *tomorrow*. The hours that he had to survive. The hours that lay between him and the morning when the embassy would come and the lawyer would come and Ahmad might come and the machinery of his defence would begin operating, the machinery that was currently dormant because the machinery operated on schedules and the schedules were diurnal, following the same sun that was now below the horizon, and below the horizon was night, and night was the time when the machinery stopped and the cells continued and the people inside them were alone with their three metres and their towels and the words that circled and would not land.

---

He thought about Lena.

L-E-N-A. The letters carved into the wood of Bed 7 by a Swedish woman who had done exactly what Connor had done -- carried for Felix, escalated from envelopes to the final load, been arrested at a checkpoint on the same highway, the same road, the same destination Connor had not reached. Lena was in Kajang Prison now, the women's facility south of KL, where she had been for four years and would remain until the court decided whether she would live or die. Lena had sat in a cell like this one. Maybe this cell. She had sat on a bench and heard the hum and felt the cold and thought the same thoughts in the same progression -- panic, denial, planning, despair -- because the cycle was not individual but universal, the biological program that activated when the body recognised it could not escape and the mind recognised that escape was not the issue, the issue was time, the issue was how to exist inside the time that the cell demanded.

She had carved her name. That was the answer. She had known there would be a next one -- the person who would sleep in Bed 7 after her, who would place their hand on the carved letters and not read them, who would be recruited by Felix and carry packages and ignore warnings and arrive, eventually, in a cell like this. The carving was her warning, the Lantern Hostel's equivalent of the markings prisoners made on cell walls, the testimony of the consumed.

Connor had not read it. Forty-seven nights in Bed 7 and he had not read the name. His hand had brushed the carved letters on the first night and the touch had not registered, the machine converting it from sensation to nothing. He had not read the drug penalty sign at KLIA2, or the hostel poster, or Priya's guidebook, or the Dangerous Drugs Act she had printed and left on his pillow. He had not read any of the texts the world had written for him, the texts placed in his path with the frequency and urgency of a world trying desperately to communicate one piece of information: *this country will kill you for what you are doing.* And now he was in a room with nothing to read except the walls, and the walls said nothing, and the silence of the walls was the silence he had chosen -- the silence of a man who had been surrounded by information and had refused it all.

---

Ahmad.

The name surfaced suddenly -- Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, this building. Ahmad was here. His desk was somewhere on the other side of the locked doors and the corridors that separated cell C-7 from the offices where the narcotics officers did their work. The machine that had prevented Connor from speaking to Ahmad -- the machine that required denial to operate -- was gone. You could not deny what you were sitting inside. You could not rationalise a three-by-three-metre concrete room. He could speak now. He could say the simple sentence that would have changed everything: *My name is Connor Briggs. I've been carrying methamphetamine for Felix Decker.*

He went to the bars. "I need to speak to Sergeant Ahmad. Narcotics Division. He gave me his card. I have information about a trafficking network operating out of a hostel on Petaling Street. Names, locations, routes. I can cooperate."

The corporal appeared, unhurried.

"No, please -- this is important. Sergeant Ahmad knows about Felix Decker. He's been watching --"

"Sergeant Ahmad is not on duty tonight. Tomorrow."

Tomorrow. The word again. The concrete wall of the word. Connor returned to the bench. The towel had cooled against his shoulders, the microfiber releasing its warmth into the cell's air-conditioned atmosphere, the warmth leaving the fabric the way the warmth was leaving Connor's body, the slow, physical process of a warm thing becoming a cold thing in a cold environment.

He pulled the towel over his head. A hood. A tent. A cave. The towel's blue fabric blocked the blue-white buzz and the blue was the blue of the towel and not the blue-white of the tube and the difference mattered because the towel's blue was his blue, was the blue of the Andaman Sea and the Blue Mountains and the swimming pools and the beaches where the towel had been, the blue that was the colour of the life that had existed before the cell. Under the towel, in the small, dark, soft space that the fabric created, he could not see the cell. He could not see the bars or the wall or the squat toilet or the corridor. He could only see the blue of the towel and the dark beneath it and the dark was better than the light because the dark was chosen and the light was imposed and the difference between chosen and imposed was the difference between freedom and imprisonment, the difference that he was learning now, in the fluorescent hours, with the intimacy of a student whose education had been delayed but was now proceeding at the accelerated pace of total immersion.

Under the towel, he closed his eyes. Under the towel, in the dark, with his eyes closed, he could be anywhere. He could be in a hostel dorm. He could be on a beach. He could be in his childhood bedroom in Hawthorn with the cricket posters and the surfboard in the corner and the sound of his mother in the kitchen and the smell of whatever she was cooking and the certainty -- the absolute, unquestioned, foundational certainty -- that the world was safe and the world was his and the world would never, ever put him in a cell.

Under the towel, he breathed. The towel smelled of sunscreen and the sea. Under the towel, for a moment, the words stopped circling.

---

The call to prayer came from somewhere far away.

The muezzin's voice entered the cell the way water entered stone -- not through openings but through the material itself, through the concrete and the steel and the glass and the institutional architecture that was designed to keep sounds out but that could not keep out the sound of a human voice amplified by speakers mounted on a minaret and projected across the city by the power of a tradition that was older than the building, older than the law, older than the statute that had put Connor in this cell.

The voice was beautiful.

The beauty was not the beauty of performance. The muezzin was not singing for an audience. The muezzin was performing an obligation -- the adhan, the call, the summons to prayer that the Islamic tradition required five times daily and that the Malaysian mosques fulfilled with the particular, Malaysian expression of the adhan, the melodic line that was both Arabic and Malay, both universal and local, the voice rising and falling in the intervals that had been established fourteen centuries ago and had been repeated, with variations, every day since.

*Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.*

The words reached the cell in fragments, the consonants and vowels scattered by the distance and the concrete, the voice arriving as more melody than language, more shape than substance, the muezzin's words broken into their musical components and reassembled by the cell's acoustics into something that was neither the original call nor a different call but a third thing, a cell-filtered version, the call to prayer as heard from inside a holding cell at Dang Wangi, the sound that was beautiful and terrible and completely indifferent to Connor's situation.

The indifference was the beauty's sharpest edge. The muezzin did not know Connor was in the cell. The muezzin did not know that his voice was reaching a twenty-seven-year-old Australian backpacker who had been arrested for drug trafficking and was sitting on a steel bench with a blue towel over his head. The muezzin was performing the adhan because the time for prayer had arrived and the adhan was performed when the time arrived, and the time arrived regardless of who was listening and regardless of where they were listening from and regardless of whether the listening was voluntary or involuntary, whether the listener was a believer at a mosque or a prisoner in a cell or a tourist on a rooftop or no one at all.

The call did not care. The call was, in its indifference, the purest expression of the truth that Connor's father had spoken at Tullamarine and that Connor had spent forty-seven days denying: *the rules don't care who you are.* The adhan was a rule. The adhan was a call that operated on its own schedule, by its own logic, for its own purposes, and the purposes did not include Connor Briggs. The purposes included the faithful, the community, the tradition, the God to whom the call was directed -- but not Connor. Connor was incidental. Connor was the accidental listener, the prisoner who happened to be within earshot, the man whose cell happened to be in a building that happened to be within range of a mosque that happened to be performing the obligation that it had performed every day for however many decades or centuries the mosque had existed.

The voice faded. The call ended. The silence returned -- not a full silence but the cell's version of silence, which was the fluorescent hum and the distant sounds of the building (a phone somewhere, a door closing, the mechanical rhythm of an institution operating through the evening) and Connor's breathing, which had slowed, which had returned to something approaching normal, the respiratory rate descending from the panic's peak to the lower, slower rhythm of a body that had exhausted its panic and was now in the phase that followed, the phase that was not calm but was the absence of acute distress, the plateau between the peaks, the flatland of endurance.

---

The fluorescent light never turned off.

The permanence was the horror. The switch was somewhere beyond the bars, in the territory of the people who controlled the cell and its conditions, and the institution had decided: light. Always. The light of surveillance, of the state's need to see what was in the cell at all times, the light that served not the prisoner's comfort but the institution's control. The light was the opposite of the ceiling fan in the hostel. The fan in Dorm 3 had moved -- blades cutting the warm air, producing wind and shadow and the rhythmic comfort of a machine working for you, its tick marking time, each revolution a unit of time passing toward morning and then afternoon and then night, and the night was dark and the dark was relief. The tube did not move. The tube produced a single, sustained, unwavering tone, the tone of a system in steady state, the tone of permanence. The fan had been in a place where time moved. The tube was in a place where time stopped -- no day, no night, just the light, always the light, the light that made every moment identical to every other moment. The light of consequence. The light of after.

Connor lay on the bench. The steel was cold beneath his shoulder blades. The towel was beneath his head, folded into a pillow, the microfiber providing a thin barrier between his skull and the steel, the barrier insufficient for comfort but sufficient for the idea of comfort, the idea that a pillow was present and that the presence of a pillow meant that this was a place where sleeping was possible, even if sleeping was not possible, even if the light was on and the hum was loud and the words were still circling -- mandatory, death, penalty -- the three birds that could not land.

He stared at the tube. The tube stared back. The tube was, in this moment, the most present thing in his existence -- more present than the walls, more present than the bars, more present than the distant sounds of the building or the fading memory of the muezzin's call. The tube was the cell's eye. The tube was the cell's voice. The tube was the cell's answer to every question, and the answer was always the same: *you are here, and here is lit, and the light is not for you.*

He thought about nothing. He tried to think about nothing. The trying was the failure -- the mind could not think about nothing because the mind's nature was to think, to process, to produce, and the mind's production in this cell was the words, always the words, the three words and their variants and their implications and their echoes. The words were not thoughts. The words were conditions. The words were the atmosphere. The words were the air he breathed, the light he saw, the hum he heard. The words were the cell.

The three words.

He had been in the cell for approximately two hours. The approximation was based on the pacing -- the circuits he had counted, the minutes he had derived, the time he had estimated with the imprecise mathematics of a man using his body as a measuring instrument. Two hours. Two hours of the flat white light. Two hours of the hum. Two hours of the three-by-three-metre world.

Two hours.

The night was long. The night was the distance between now and tomorrow. The night was the territory that he had to cross to reach the morning, to reach the embassy, to reach the lawyer, to reach Ahmad. The night was the desert that lay between the cell and the oasis, the lightless hours -- except the hours were not lightless, the hours were lit, perpetually lit, the fluorescent tube ensuring that the night would not be night but a continuation of the timeless, directionless, institutional light that was the cell's permanent condition.

He closed his eyes. The closing did not produce darkness. The closing produced the red-orange glow of light passing through eyelids, the tube's glare penetrating the thin skin and the blood vessels and reaching the retina even through the closed lids, the light refusing to be shut out, the light insisting on its presence, the light saying: *you cannot escape me. I am the condition. I am the cell. I am here.*

He pulled the towel over his face. The blue fabric dimmed the light. Under the towel, with his eyes closed, the light was finally reduced to a suggestion rather than a presence, the faintest glow of blue-filtered fluorescence, the minimum light, the almost-dark.

In the almost-dark, he waited.

---

A sound.

The sound was different from the sounds that had constituted the cell's acoustic environment for the past two hours -- different from the hum, different from the distant building sounds, different from his own breathing. The sound was specific, metallic, close. The sound was a key.

A key in a lock.

The sound of metal entering metal, of tumblers engaging, of a mechanism designed to open when the correct key was inserted and turned. The sound was at the cell door -- the barred door, the green-painted bars, the door that separated the cell from the corridor and the corridor from the world.

Connor sat up. The towel fell from his face. The fluorescent light hit him full -- the blue-white assault after the towel's blue shade, the tube reasserting its dominance, the cell snapping back into focus, every surface and every edge and every bar and every bolt and every stain and every crack in the concrete visible in the comprehensive, merciless illumination.

The key turned. The lock clicked. The door opened.

An officer stood in the corridor. Not the corporal from before -- a different officer, younger, the face unfamiliar, the uniform the same. The officer held the door open with one hand and with the other hand gestured into the corridor, where a second figure stood.

A man. Mid-thirties. Malay. Average height, average build, the build that was unremarkable in the specific way that made a person forgettable. He wore a dark red T-shirt, jeans, running shoes. His hair was short, neatly cut. His face was calm -- notably calm, the calm of a person who was where he expected to be, or who had decided to treat the situation with the equanimity that was either a personality trait or a performance.

The officer ushered the man into the cell. The door closed. The lock clicked. The footsteps receded.

The man surveyed the cell -- a quick inventory, eyes moving from wall to wall, bench to toilet, bars to tube. Then he looked at Connor. The look was brief, open, the look of a man acknowledging another man in a shared space. He smiled -- small, practiced, the minimum unit of human connection.

"Bar fight," he said, with a shrug that said *it's nothing, it's the kind of thing that happens to anyone on a Friday night*. The shrug was the body language of a man who had been in cells before, or who wanted Connor to believe he had.

He extended his hand.

"Rizal," he said.

The name entered the cell and the cell held it. The fluorescent light hummed. The night stretched ahead, unmeasured and immeasurable.
