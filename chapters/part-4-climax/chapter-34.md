# Chapter 34: Rizal

Four hours in Cell C-7 and Connor had spoken maybe sixty words to other human beings, most of them in one direction -- the arresting officer reading the charge, the transport officer saying *tomorrow* three times to three different questions, the processing clerk issuing instructions in procedural monotone, the guard tossing the blue towel into the cell with two words of English: "For comfort." Sixty words. Four hours. The fluorescent light buzzing its sixty-hertz hum into the concrete box and the concrete box humming back and the exchange between light and architecture being the only conversation the cell had to offer.

The blue towel was around his shoulders. The towel was not providing comfort. The towel was preventing his body temperature from dropping further in the eighteen-degree air conditioning that Dang Wangi maintained across its holding cells. Comfort required human input -- a voice, a face, the back-and-forth of conversation, the social stimulus that his brain had been receiving for twenty-seven years and that had been severed four hours ago with the abruptness of a power outage. He was the man who had befriended Felix because Felix was there, who had fallen for Priya because her attention was a form of oxygen. He was a man whose entire architecture of self depended on the presence of other people, and the other people were gone -- Priya on a plane, Jake in Langkawi, Felix wherever Felix went when the mule was caught -- and the phone that held their names was in an evidence bag and the cell was three metres by three metres and the silence was not the absence of sound but the absence of anyone who cared whether he made sound or not.

He sat on the steel bench with his head in his hands and the blue towel on his shoulders and the fear that had passed through fear into something chronic, something metabolic, and he was, for the first time in his twenty-seven years, completely alone.

And then the corridor filled with sound.

---

The sound was footsteps. Two sets. One heavy, the measured tread of a police officer in standard-issue boots, the boot-steps that Connor had been hearing at intervals all afternoon -- the guard walking the corridor, checking cells, the mechanical perambulation of a man performing a routine that required his body but not his attention. The second set was different. Lighter. The sound of shoes, not boots. Shoes on concrete. The sound of a civilian walking in a place where civilians did not walk voluntarily.

The footsteps grew louder. Closer. The corridor had the acoustic properties of a concrete tube -- sound travelled through it with minimal absorption, the hard surfaces reflecting rather than dampening, the footsteps arriving at Connor's cell with a clarity that made them seem closer than they were, the acoustic illusion of a space that had been designed for surveillance, not comfort.

Connor sat up on the bench. The sitting up was involuntary -- the body responding to the sound of approaching humans the way a dog responded to a key in a lock, the autonomous activation of attention, the social animal's hard-wired response to the presence of its species. He straightened. He pulled the towel tighter around his shoulders. He looked at the bars.

The guard appeared first. He was the same guard who had been on shift since Connor arrived -- a Malay man in his forties, solidly built, the face neutral, professional -- a cell corridor face, carried the way a uniform was carried, as a tool rather than an expression. He walked past Connor's cell without looking in, which was standard -- the guards looked in on scheduled checks, every thirty minutes by Connor's estimation, and between checks they passed the cells as they passed the walls, as features of the environment rather than points of engagement.

Behind the guard, a man.

The man was Malaysian. Thirties, maybe thirty-two, maybe thirty-five -- the age difficult to pin because the man's face had the quality of faces that settled early and aged slowly, the bone structure set, the features defined, the face that would look substantially the same at thirty and forty and fifty. He was solidly built -- not tall, maybe five-eight, but wide through the shoulders, stocky, solid, weight sitting on him like something he'd been born with, the shoulders and arms of someone for whom strength was occupational rather than recreational. His hair was black, short, neat. His skin was brown -- the medium brown of the Malay majority, the skin that placed him in the demographic that constituted the majority of Malaysia's population and the majority of its police force and the majority of its prison population and the majority of its everything.

He wore civilian clothes. A dark polo shirt. Jeans. Running shoes -- white, scuffed, rubber-soled, the same pair for mosque and market. No watch. No rings. No visible tattoos. Nothing on his person that distinguished him from the millions of other Malaysian men in their thirties who wore polo shirts and jeans and running shoes and moved through the world with the unremarkable solidity of people who were not noticed because they did not invite notice.

The guard stopped at Cell C-7. He took keys from his belt. The keys were on a ring -- a large ring, institutional, the kind that janitors carried in American movies but that here was carried by police officers assigned to the holding cell corridor, the ring containing the keys to every cell in the row, each key identical to every other key because the cells were identical to every other cell and the locks were identical to every other lock and the system did not differentiate between one cell and another because differentiation was the province of the humans inside, not the structures around them.

The guard unlocked the cell. The lock turned with a sound that was metallic and final, the sound of tumblers engaging, the mechanical vocabulary of access and restriction. The door swung open. The hinges were oiled -- the door moved silently, the silence a maintenance achievement in a building where most things creaked.

The man stepped into the cell. The stepping was casual -- not the step of a man entering a cage but the step of a man entering a room, the foot placed with the confidence of someone who had been in rooms like this before, who understood the dimensions, who knew where the bench was and where the toilet was and where the light fell and where it didn't.

The guard closed the door. The lock turned again. The guard walked away. The footsteps receded. The corridor was silent.

The man stood in the centre of the cell. The centre was approximately one-and-a-half metres from Connor's bench. In a cell of nine square metres, one-and-a-half metres was both a distance and a proximity -- far enough to not be threatening, close enough to be social, the distance that humans maintained in elevators and queues and all the spaces where strangers were forced to share volumes that intimacy had not sanctioned.

The man looked around the cell. The looking was slow, deliberate, the survey of a person acquainting himself with an environment -- the bench, the toilet, the walls, the bars, the fluorescent light. His eyes moved across the surfaces the way a tradesman's eyes moved across a new job site -- cataloguing, assessing, the professional's appraisal of a space that was not personal but operational.

His eyes reached Connor. They settled. The settling was not a stare -- it was a regard, the social regard of one person acknowledging another person's presence in a shared space, the look that strangers exchanged in waiting rooms and train carriages and all the places where proximity was involuntary and acknowledgement was the currency that purchased coexistence.

"The light, right?" the man said.

His voice was unremarkable. Not deep, not high. The English was good -- accented, the consonants slightly harder than a native speaker's, the vowels slightly flatter, but fluent, the English of a Malaysian who had been educated in the national school system where English was compulsory, or the English of a man who had spent time around foreigners, who had absorbed the language through immersion rather than study.

"The light," the man said again, looking up at the fluorescent tube. "It never goes off. They do that on purpose, you know. Messes with your head. You lose track of time. That's the point."

Connor looked at the man. The man was looking at the light. The man's face, illuminated from directly above by the fluorescent tube, was mapped with the particular shadows that overhead light created -- the eye sockets slightly darkened, the cheekbones highlighted, the nose casting a shadow down the upper lip. The face was not handsome or ugly. The face was a face. It was human. It was present. It was the first face that had spoken to Connor in full sentences since the arresting officer on the highway, and the fullness of the sentences -- the casual, conversational, almost companionable sentences about the light and its purpose -- was so far from the monosyllabic proceduralism of every other human interaction in the past six hours that the effect was physical, a loosening in Connor's chest, the relaxation of a tension that he hadn't known was there until it eased.

"Yeah," Connor said. His voice was hoarse. The hoarseness surprised him -- he hadn't spoken in four hours, and the vocal cords had apparently entered a state of disuse, the muscles that produced speech having stood down when speech became purposeless. "Yeah, the light's doing my head in."

The man nodded. The nod was sympathetic -- not performative, not exaggerated, just the small, downward motion of a head that had heard something and agreed with it. The nod said: *I understand. I'm in here too. The light is doing my head in as well.*

The man walked to the bench. The bench was three metres long -- bolted to the wall, steel, the surface flat and unpadded, designed for sitting rather than comfort. Connor was at the left end. The man sat at the right end. The gap between them was approximately one-and-a-half metres -- the same distance that had separated them when the man was standing, the distance maintained not by calculation but by instinct, the social instinct that calibrated physical proximity according to relationship, and the relationship between two strangers in a cell was the relationship of the gap, the metre-and-a-half that said *I'm here but I'm not in your space*.

The man sat. The sitting was unhurried. He placed his back against the wall, the way you sat when you expected to be sitting for a while, the posture of someone settling in. He extended his legs. The running shoes were scuffed, the soles worn -- worn thin at the heels, walked-in, the shoes of a particular socioeconomic band that moved through the city on foot and on public transport rather than in the air-conditioned interiors of Protons and Peroduas.

He stretched. The stretch was physical, genuine -- the reaching of arms overhead, the arching of the back, the expansion of the chest, the movements of a body that had been confined and was now recalibrating, redistributing its tensions across the available space. The stretch was ordinary. The stretch was the thing that people did when they sat down after a period of standing or walking. The stretch was human.

"Stupid thing, honestly," the man said, settling back against the wall. He looked at Connor. He smiled. The smile was small, self-deprecating, the smile of a man about to tell a story about his own foolishness. "Bar fight. Changkat. Had too much to drink, said the wrong thing to the wrong guy, and then..." He made a gesture with his hand -- a quick, illustrative movement that suggested a punch thrown, the physical shorthand for violence that transcended language. "Woke up with the police standing over me. The other guy's nose is broken. I'm in here."

He shook his head. The head-shake was rueful, the gesture of a man who recognised his own idiocy and was neither proud of it nor destroyed by it but simply observing it, the way you observed weather -- *it happened, it was unfortunate, it will pass*.

"Stupid," he said again. "My boss is going to kill me."

The phrase *my boss is going to kill me* was so ordinary, so completely the phrase that every person who had ever done something foolish at night and would face consequences in the morning had used, that it landed in the cell like a piece of furniture from the outside world -- familiar, normal, the linguistic artefact of a life that operated on the axis of employment and socialising and the consequences of mixing the two. The phrase was the opposite of Section 39B. The phrase was the opposite of mandatory death penalty. The phrase was the vocabulary of a man whose worst problem was a broken nose and an angry boss, and the vocabulary was a window -- a small, verbal window that opened onto the world outside the cell, the world where people had bar fights and bosses and the word *kill* was a metaphor rather than a statute.

Connor felt something shift. The shift was tectonic -- not large, not visible, but deep, the movement of a plate beneath the surface. The plate was the plate of isolation, the solid mass of aloneness that had been compressing him for four hours, and the shift was caused by the man's voice, by the man's presence, by the simple, irreducible fact that there was another person in the cell and the person was speaking and the speaking was directed at Connor and the direction meant that Connor was no longer alone.

"I'm Rizal," the man said.

He extended his hand. The hand was across the gap -- reaching from the right end of the bench to the space between them, the hand offered in the universal gesture of introduction, the handshake that cultures worldwide had adopted as the first physical transaction between strangers. The hand was clean, the nails trimmed, the skin callused across the palm, the hand of a man who worked with his hands, who gripped things, who used his body as a tool.

Connor took the hand. The handshake was firm but not aggressive -- the grip calibrated to the middle register of social introduction, not the bone-crushing assertion of dominance and not the limp surrender of indifference but the measured, appropriate pressure of two strangers establishing contact. The hand was warm. The warmth was the warmth of a living body, the metabolic heat that humans produced and transmitted through their skin, and the warmth passed through the handshake from Rizal's palm to Connor's palm and the transfer was the first warm thing Connor had felt in four hours.

"Connor," Connor said.

"Connor," Rizal repeated. The repetition was the way Malaysians often processed foreign names -- saying the name back, tasting the syllables, fitting the foreign phonemes into the Malay phonological framework. "Australian?"

"Yeah. Melbourne."

"Melbourne. Cricket. Coffee. That lane with the street art."

"Hosier Lane."

"Hosier Lane, that's it." Rizal smiled again. The smile was the smile of a man who had just made a connection, who had found a piece of shared knowledge between himself and a stranger, the social lubrication of common ground. "My cousin went to Melbourne. Studied engineering at... Monash? RMIT? One of those."

"Monash," Connor said. "I went to Monash."

This was true. He had gone to Monash. He had attended for one year. He had studied business. He had dropped out. But the statement -- *I went to Monash* -- was not the full truth, it was the edited version, the version he had been telling for four years, the version that implied completion and competence and the shared institutional identity that came from naming a university. In a holding cell at Dang Wangi, the version was what it was. Nobody was checking transcripts.

"Small world," Rizal said. The phrase was a cliche, the cliche that people used when coincidences appeared in conversations between strangers, but the cliche was functional -- it performed the work of establishing that the world was small and that the two people in this cell had things in common and that the having-in-common was a bridge and the bridge was crossable.

Rizal leaned back against the wall. He reached into his pocket and emerged with a single cigarette, slightly bent, the paper wrinkled from pocket-storage. No pack. Just the one cigarette.

"The guard let me keep one," Rizal said, noticing Connor's look. "Professional courtesy."

He produced a lighter from his other pocket -- small, red, disposable, the BIC lighter that existed in the gap between regulation and reality, the gap that Malaysian institutions maintained between what the rules said and what happened. Rizal lit the cigarette. The flame appeared for two seconds and disappeared, leaving behind the orange glow of the ember.

The smoke filled the cell. The smoke was the most alive thing Connor had experienced since the arrest -- organic, warm, the acrid-sweet scent of tobacco displacing the disinfectant and the older smell beneath it, the smell that decades of confinement had baked into the concrete. The smoke was a visitor from the outside world, and Connor inhaled it the way a starving man inhaled the smell of food.

"Sorry," Rizal said, gesturing with the cigarette. "Should have asked. You mind?"

"No," Connor said. "It's good, actually."

"So," Rizal said, exhaling smoke toward the fluorescent light where it rose in a white-grey column. "What happened to you, then?"

The question was the casual interrogative of a cellmate, not a police officer. *What are you in for, what's your story.* Connor looked at Rizal's open face and felt the familiarity of it -- not the features but the energy, the posture, the expression. A hundred hostel common rooms had trained him to recognise this face, the face that said: *I'm here. You're here. Let's talk.*

"It's a long story," Connor said.

"Brother," Rizal said, gesturing at the cell, "we've got nothing but time."

Connor almost smiled. The muscles achieved approximately 60 percent of it.

"I'm not sure I should..." Connor began.

"Hey, no pressure." Rizal raised his free hand, palm out. "You don't have to tell me anything. I'm just..." He shrugged. "I'm a talker. My wife says it's my worst quality. Can't sit in a room with someone without trying to have a conversation. It's a problem."

The self-deprecation was disarming -- the generosity of a person who offered their own weakness as a gift, making the space safer, the gap on the bench smaller without either person having moved.

"You married?" Connor asked. The question surprised him -- it had emerged from the social autopilot his brain was now running at full capacity.

"Six years," Rizal said. "Her name's Ain. Two kids. Boy and a girl. She's going to be furious." He drew on the cigarette. "The bar fight thing. She told me to stop going to Changkat. She said *one day you're going to hit someone and end up in a cell*." He exhaled smoke. "She was right. She's always right. That's the other problem."

"What about you?" Rizal asked. "Married? Girlfriend?"

"I had a..." Connor paused. Priya. The name rose in his mind and the name carried weight -- the weight of a person, the weight of mornings in the kitchen and afternoons at the Batu Caves and the night on the air well bench when she'd asked about Malaysian law and he'd kissed her to avoid answering. "There was someone. She left."

"Left you?"

"Left KL. Went back to London."

"Ah." Rizal nodded. The nod was knowing -- the nod of a man who understood that relationships had geographies and that geographies had endings. "Long distance doesn't work. My brother tried it with a girl from Sarawak. Lasted two months."

"Yeah," Connor said. "It wouldn't have worked."

Rizal finished the cigarette. He dropped the butt on the concrete floor and ground it out with his shoe. The grinding was thorough -- the shoe twisting on the butt, crushing it, extinguishing the ember completely, habitual, careful about fire even in a concrete cell. The butt lay on the floor, a small cylinder of grey ash and white paper, the residue of seven minutes of combustion that had changed the cell's atmosphere from institutional to human.

The smoke lingered. Rizal settled back against the wall, his posture relaxed now, his eyes moving idly across the cell until they landed on Connor's towel.

"Nice towel," Rizal said.

Connor looked down at the blue microfiber draped over his shoulders. The towel that had been with him through twelve countries. The towel that smelled of sunscreen and the South China Sea and the accumulated history of his travels. The towel that the guard had tossed into the cell for comfort.

"Smart to keep it," Rizal continued. "It gets cold in here. The AC. They keep it cold on purpose, same as the light. Messes with your body, you know? You can't sleep if you're cold. You can't sleep if the light's on. You can't sleep, you get tired, you get confused. And confused people..."

He didn't finish the sentence. The unfinished sentence hung in the air the way the cigarette smoke had hung -- present, suggestive, the meaning clear without the words. Confused people talked. Confused people cooperated. Confused people signed things.

The observation was sharper than a bouncer's casual knowledge should have been. But Connor didn't notice the sharpness. He noticed the solidarity -- *they* were the police, and Rizal was on his side of the bars.

"I didn't know about the cold," Connor said. "I thought the AC was just... on."

"On, yeah, but on high. Always high. The offices upstairs, they have heaters. I know a guy who worked here. He said the holding cells are set to sixteen degrees. They want you uncomfortable. It's a technique."

"You seem to know a lot about this place," Connor said.

Rizal shrugged. "I've been here before. Not this cell. Another one. Two years ago. Different bar fight." He smiled. The smile was sheepish, the smile of a man whose history contained repetitions that he was not proud of. "I told you, Changkat is my problem. Too many bars, too many drunk guys, too many chances for things to go wrong."

"What happened the first time?"

"Night in the cell. Fine in the morning. Magistrate, pay a fine, community service, go home. Ain didn't speak to me for a week." He laughed. The laugh was short, genuine, rueful with the memory of his wife's anger -- a different kind of anger from the anger of the law, a domestic anger, an anger that was negotiable. "This time might be worse. The other guy's nose. That's proper damage. Might be ABH. Might be a few days in here."

"What do you do?" Connor asked. "For work?"

"Bouncer," Rizal said. "Club on Changkat. SUTRA. You know it?"

Connor didn't know it. He had been to Changkat -- the nightlife district that Felix had taken him to on the first nights, the street of bars and clubs and the Malaysian entertainment industry's concentration point, the street where the night economy happened. But SUTRA was not a name he recognised. He had been to other places, Felix's places, the bars where Felix was known and the drinks were free and the VIP sections opened without question.

"Big place," Rizal said. "Three floors. House music. Lot of tourists. That's where I learned English, actually. Tourists. You talk to them every night. *No, sir, you can't bring that in. No, ma'am, the capacity is full. Yes, the DJ starts at eleven.* After a few years you sound like a guidebook."

"Sounds like a good gig," Connor said.

"It's okay. The money's okay. The hours are bad. You're up all night, sleep all day. Your wife thinks you're having an affair because you come home at four AM smelling like perfume and beer. You're not having an affair -- you're just surrounded by drunk people who fall on you." He paused. "The fights are the worst part. People get stupid when they drink. Especially tourists. No offence."

"None taken."

"Australians are the worst." Rizal said this with a grin -- the grin that softened the statement, that turned it from observation into joke, the humour of a man speaking to an Australian about Australians and trusting that the Australian would receive the stereotype with the good humour that the delivery invited. "Three drinks and they want to wrestle. Every time. Is it the sun? Is there something in the water in Australia that makes you all want to fight after three beers?"

Connor laughed -- small, reduced, but real. "It might be the sun," he said.

"It might be the sun," Rizal agreed, stretching again, making himself at home in the uncomfortable space. The conversation paused, and the pause was comfortable. Four hours ago silence had been the enemy. Now, with Rizal on the bench, silence was shared space.

"So," Rizal said. "What are you doing in KL? Travelling?"

"Yeah," Connor said. "Travelling."

"How long?"

"Six weeks."

"Six weeks in KL?" Rizal's eyebrows rose. The rise was the expression of mild surprise -- six weeks was a long time for a backpacker in one city, and the surprise was the surprise of a local who understood his city's tourist appeal and knew that most tourists stayed three to five days before moving to Penang or Langkawi or the Cameron Highlands. "That's a lot. Most mat salleh stay a few days."

"I liked it here," Connor said. And the statement was true, or had been true, or was a version of true that contained the core fact without the surrounding circumstances. He had liked KL. He had liked the food. He had liked the heat. He had liked the hostel. He had liked the feeling of being somewhere that was cheap enough and warm enough and alive enough that staying felt easier than leaving, the inertia of a place that was comfortable enough to prevent departure and dangerous enough to eventually demand it.

"Where are you staying? Hotel?"

"Hostel. The Lantern. On Petaling Street."

"I know the Lantern." Rizal nodded. The nod was the nod of local knowledge -- a man who lived in KL and knew its landmarks, its businesses, the geography of a city he inhabited. "Old building, right? Red lanterns. Petaling Street. Near the temple."

"Yeah, that's the one."

"Good location. Cheap. My cousin -- different cousin, not the Melbourne one -- he did some painting work there a few years ago. Old Chinese shophouse. He said the owner was a character."

"Uncle Razak."

"That's the name. With the map. The pins."

Connor felt a flicker of something. Not alarm -- the flicker was fainter than alarm, more subtle, the faint registration of a detail that was either a coincidence or something else. Rizal knew the Lantern. Rizal's cousin had worked there. Rizal knew about Razak's map. The connections were the kind of connections that existed in KL's social fabric -- the city of three million that operated, at the neighbourhood level, like a village, where everyone knew someone who knew someone who had been somewhere and the degrees of separation between any two points in the social network were fewer than the degrees suggested by the city's size.

The flicker passed. The flicker passed because Connor's brain was not operating in the mode that detected flickers -- the brain was operating in the mode that craved connection, that needed conversation, that was running the social programmes at full capacity and allocating its processing power to the production and reception of speech rather than the analysis of anomalies. The brain was starving. The brain was being fed. The brain was not going to question the food.

"So what happened?" Rizal asked. "If you don't mind. Six weeks in KL, nice hostel, and now you're in here. Something went wrong."

The question was gentle -- the fundamental interrogative of the backpacker circuit: *what happened? How did you end up here?* Connor had been asked this question a hundred times in a hundred hostels, but the context was different now. In a hostel the answer was a story. In a cell the answer was a confession.

"It's..." Connor began.

He stopped. The last moment of caution -- *be careful, this is a police station, anything you say can be used as evidence*. But the circuit was weak, weakened by four hours of isolation and the desperate need for human contact, and the idea of stopping the conversation, of returning to the silence, was physically repellant. For Connor, the social need was the survival instinct. Had always been.

"I got in trouble," Connor said. The admission was the crack in the wall through which everything else would flow.

"Drugs?" Rizal said. The word landed soft, almost tender -- not an accusation but the educated guess of a man who understood that foreign nationals in this particular station were, more often than not, here for this particular reason.

Connor nodded.

"Mate," Rizal said -- the word slightly accented, borrowed from the Australian lexicon and adapted to the Malaysian mouth, a bridge. "That's heavy. Like, trafficking heavy? Or possession?"

"Trafficking," Connor said. The word was in the air and could not be retrieved.

Rizal was quiet for five seconds. Long enough to honour the weight of the word and short enough to not leave Connor alone with it.

"How much?" Rizal asked.

"Four hundred and fifty grams."

The number sat between them. Rizal's face changed -- not dramatically, not the theatrical shock of a man performing surprise, but a subtle recalibration, the eyebrows drawing slightly closer, the mouth tightening slightly, the micro-expressions that conveyed recognition of scale. Four hundred and fifty grams was nine times the fifty-gram threshold. Four hundred and fifty grams was not a mistake or an experiment or a personal supply that could be argued down in court. Four hundred and fifty grams was a quantity that the law had no ambiguity about.

"Methamphetamine?" Rizal asked, and the asking was quiet now, the voice lowered, the register shifted from conversational to confessional, the acoustic change that humans made when the subject matter crossed from public to private, from shareable to sensitive.

"Yeah."

"Connor." Rizal shook his head. The head-shake was slow, heavy, the head-shake of a man who understood the implications and was communicating his understanding through the most basic gestural vocabulary available -- the shake that said *this is bad, this is very bad, I understand how bad this is*. "Four fifty. That's... you know what that means in Malaysia?"

"I know now."

"You didn't know before?"

The question was the question that defined Connor's entire story. The question that Priya had asked and Tomoko had implied and Mei Ling had contained in her silences and Mama Siti had buried in her proverbs and Ahmad had been waiting to hear the answer to. *Did you know? Did you know before? When did you know?*

"I didn't know what I was carrying," Connor said. "Not at first. I thought it was..." He paused. The pause was the hesitation of a man on the edge of a longer story, the story that extended backward from this cell to the hostel and from the hostel to the common room and from the common room to the first night and the rooftop and the German with the scar on his eyebrow and the words *I could use someone reliable around here*. "I thought it was phone accessories. Business documents. That kind of thing."

"Someone told you that?"

"Yeah."

"Someone at the hostel?"

"A guy I met there," Connor said. "At the Lantern. He was staying there. He was... he seemed like a mate. He was cool, you know? He knew everyone. He always had money. He bought rounds. He told good stories."

Connor was talking now. The talking had acquired its own momentum -- the momentum of a story that had been contained for hours, for days, for the forty-seven days since the first envelope, the story that had lived inside him as a growing mass of fact and fear and rationalisation, the story that he had never told anyone in its entirety because telling required the dismantling of the machine, the machine that converted warnings into noise and truth into trivia and the word *trafficking* into the word *logistics*. The story wanted out. The story had pressure. The story was like the confession that the police station was designed to extract, except that the police station had not extracted it -- the police station had placed a man on a bench and the man had been warm and interested and available and the warmth and the interest and the availability had done what the cold and the light and the silence could not.

"He was German," Connor said.

"The guy at the hostel?"

"Yeah. German. Older than me. Thirty-one. He had a private room. He was... different from the other backpackers. Polished. Like he had money but wasn't flashy about it. He spoke five languages. He knew KL like a local. He knew where to go, who to talk to, how to get in anywhere."

Rizal listened, body angled slightly toward Connor, head tilted.

"He started asking me to do things," Connor said. "Small things. Carry an envelope to a cafe. Deliver a package to a shop in Brickfields. He said it was business stuff -- import-export, phone accessories, that kind of thing. He paid me. Cash. Two hundred ringgit for the first one. Then five hundred. Then more."

"And you didn't check what was in the packages?"

"No." The word was flat. The word was the confession within the confession, the admission that contained the entire story's moral architecture -- the single syllable that represented every warning ignored, every red flag rationalised, every moment when Connor could have opened a package or asked a question or looked at the thing he was carrying and chosen instead to look away, to not know, to maintain the fiction that ignorance was innocence and that a sealed envelope was just a sealed envelope and that a man who paid cash for deliveries and lived in a private room and wore leather driving gloves was just a generous friend with eczema.

"I didn't check," Connor said. "I didn't want to know. I needed the money and I trusted him and the two things together were enough to stop me from asking questions."

Rizal nodded. The nod was understanding, not judgemental.

"How long?" Rizal asked. "How many deliveries?"

"Six weeks. Dozens. I don't know exactly. It started with envelopes and ended with..." He gestured vaguely, the gesture encompassing the cell and the charge and the suitcase on the highway shoulder. "A suitcase."

"The four fifty was in a suitcase?"

"In the lining. Vacuum-sealed. Sewn in. I was supposed to take a bus to Penang. They got me at a checkpoint on the highway. There was a dog."

"A dog," Rizal repeated. "The K-9 unit."

"Yeah. The dog sat next to the suitcase. And that was it."

"That was it," Rizal echoed. His voice was soft -- not pity but the horizontal sympathy of a person on the same bench, in the same cell, receiving the story as a human story rather than a legal one.

The distinction was also, if Connor had been capable of seeing it, the technique. The professional listener's creation of a non-judgemental space, the calibrated warmth of a man who knew exactly how warm to be. But Connor was not capable of seeing it. Connor was seeing what he needed to see -- a face and a voice and the presence of another human being -- and the need was shaping the perception, the same way it always had.

"This German guy," Rizal said. "At the hostel. He set you up?"

"I don't know if *set up* is the right word. He... groomed me. That's what the police will probably call it. He found me when I was broke. He was nice to me. He gave me easy money. He made the deliveries feel normal. By the time I found out what I was actually carrying, I was already..." He trailed off. The trailing was the verbal equivalent of a man reaching the edge of a cliff and looking down and deciding not to jump but also not turning back, standing on the edge with the void below and the solid ground behind and unable to move in either direction.

"Already in too deep," Rizal finished.

"Yeah."

"CCTV?"

"How did you know about the CCTV?" Connor asked -- the first flicker of something that might have been caution, the brain pausing long enough to register that Rizal had said *CCTV* as though the specific mechanism of Connor's entrapment were obvious. Rizal shrugged. "It's how they do it, isn't it? These rings. They film you so you can't go to the police. My mate -- the one who worked at this station -- he told me about it. It's standard." The explanation was plausible, referencing the same contact who had explained about the cold and the light, and the moment of caution passed because caution would have meant losing the one source of human contact Connor had, and losing that was worse than any risk.

"Yeah, they had me on camera. Every delivery. My face at every location. He showed me the footage. And he said if I went to the police, the footage would be sent to... I don't know. Prosecutors. Media. Everyone. He said I was already in the system and the only way out was to do one more job. The big one. The suitcase."

"And you believed him."

"What choice did I have?"

The question was rhetorical but Rizal answered it anyway. "You could have gone to the police," Rizal said. "Before the suitcase. Before the bus."

"I tried." The admission came out fast, pushed by the pressure of guilt and regret and the specific anguish of a man who had come close enough to salvation to taste it and had turned away. "I called a cop. A narcotics sergeant. Ahmad. He gave me his card weeks ago. I called him twice. Once I got voicemail. Once I got through. I couldn't speak. I just... I couldn't make the words come out."

Rizal was quiet. The quiet had a texture now -- a thicker quiet, a more concentrated quiet, the quiet of a man who was processing information that was, perhaps, more than conversational. The quiet lasted three seconds.

"Ahmad," Rizal said. "Narcotics. Dang Wangi?"

"Yeah. Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail."

"I think I know that name. Serious guy? Forties? Moustache?"

"I don't remember a moustache. But serious, yeah. Very serious."

"That's him. He's known. Tough. By the book." Rizal paused. "He'd have helped you, Connor. If you'd talked to him. He'd have helped."

The statement was a blade. *He'd have helped.* The conditional -- the cruellest tense, the tense that described the world that would have existed if Connor had spoken into the phone instead of hanging up.

"I know," Connor said. "I know he would have."

"The German guy," Rizal said. "You said he was at the hostel. The Lantern. What was his name?"

Connor looked at Rizal. Rizal's face was open, patient, the face of a man who had nowhere else to be. The face was kind. The face was the same kind of face that Felix had worn on the rooftop on the first night -- the face of a man who made you feel chosen.

Connor opened his mouth. And then he spoke. He told Rizal everything.
