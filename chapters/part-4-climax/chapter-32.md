# Chapter 32: Dang Wangi

The drive south took two hours and forty-seven minutes.

Connor knew this not because he checked a clock -- his phone was in his daypack, which was on the seat beside him, zipped, the phone inside it dark and inaccessible because his hands were cuffed and the cuffs were in his lap and the lap was the only place the cuffs allowed his hands to be, the steel links short, perhaps eight inches of chain between the bracelets, enough to rest his hands on his thighs but not enough to reach the daypack's zipper. He knew the duration because the drive had a rhythm, and the rhythm had intervals, and the intervals were marked by the things that passed the window -- the kilometre markers counting down from the checkpoint to KL, the green signs with white numbers, KM 275, KM 250, KM 225, the numbers descending the way a countdown descended, the way a life descended when it was measured not in years or months but in kilometres of highway between a checkpoint in Perak and a police station in Kuala Lumpur.

The officers did not speak to him.

There were two of them. The driver and a second officer in the passenger seat. Both in the blue uniform of the PDRM, both facing forward, both occupying the front of the vehicle with the professional silence of men who had transported arrested persons before and who understood that the transport was not a conversation but a procedure, the movement of a body from Point A to Point B, and the body's feelings and fears and the desperate, churning interior monologue that the body produced were irrelevant to the procedure, were noise in a system that operated on signal alone.

The driver drove. The passenger officer wrote in a spiral-bound notebook -- date, time, location, suspect details, arresting officer, charge. The pen scratched. The air conditioning hummed. The tyres hissed on the asphalt. The three sounds formed the acoustic environment of the vehicle, the soundtrack of transit.

Connor sat behind the mesh partition that separated the rear seat from the front. The partition was steel, painted black, the mesh fine enough to see through but too fine to reach through, the barrier that divided the vehicle into two worlds: the world of the officers, where the radio occasionally crackled and the dashboard instruments glowed green and the windshield showed the road ahead, and the world of the arrested, which was a back seat with vinyl upholstery and a door that had no interior handle and a window that did not open and the smell of disinfectant and sweat and the accumulated human residue of every person who had sat in this seat before him.

The handcuffs were not tight. This surprised him -- the surprise arriving in the clinical, detached way that all his perceptions now arrived, as data rather than emotion, as observation rather than feeling. He had expected pain, the red marks and bruising that handcuffs produced in films, the visual evidence of restraint that communicated suffering. But the cuffs were sized correctly -- the officer who had applied them had checked the fit, had ensured that two fingers could slide between the steel and the skin, the procedure performed with the competence of a man who understood that the purpose of handcuffs was restraint, not punishment, and that the distinction mattered.

The cuffs were warm -- sun-warmed, the steel absorbing the Perak midday heat -- and they had stayed warm against his skin, reaching thermal equilibrium, the cuffs becoming the temperature of the man wearing them, becoming, in a physical sense, part of him.

He watched the landscape in reverse.

The foothills of the Titiwangsa Range, which he had watched approach through the bus window two hours ago, were now receding behind him. The green hills with their dark jungle canopy were shrinking in the rear window, the mountains returning to the distance they had occupied when he'd been travelling north, the landscape rewinding, the geography undoing itself, the journey replaying backward like a film run in reverse -- the same palm oil plantations, the same kampungs on stilts above the rice paddies, the same rest stop at Tapah visible for a moment through the window as the police vehicle passed the service area where he had eaten a pandan kuih and thanked an elderly woman and been, for thirty seconds, a normal person doing a normal thing in a normal place on a normal day.

The rest stop disappeared. The highway continued south. The landscape flattened -- the foothills giving way to the alluvial plain that surrounded KL, the low ground at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers, the land that had been tin mines and jungle before the British arrived and decided it would be a city, the land that was now eight million people and a skyline and a police force and a legal system and a cell that was waiting for him at the end of this drive.

KM 200. KM 175. KM 150.

The numbers descended. The city approached. And somewhere between KM 200 and KM 150, Connor saw the Petronas Towers.

They appeared through the windshield -- not through his window, which faced east, but through the front windshield, visible through the mesh partition, visible between the heads of the two officers, visible in the distance as two silver points against the haze of the KL skyline. The towers were small at first, the size of pins, the size of the towers as seen from the rooftop of the Lantern Hostel on the night Felix had stood against the railing and said *I could use someone reliable around here*. Then larger. The size of fingers. The size of the towers as seen from the bus window when KL had receded behind him this morning, a lifetime ago, when he had been a man on a bus going north and the towers had been behind him and shrinking.

Now the towers were ahead of him and growing.

The towers grew and the growing was the visual measure of his return to the city, the reverse odometer, the geometric proof that the distance between Connor Briggs and Kuala Lumpur was closing at one hundred and ten kilometres per hour. The towers grew from pins to fingers to the full, unmistakable profile of the Petronas Twin Towers -- silver, twin, connected by the skybridge at the forty-first floor, the icon, the landmark.

He had photographed them forty-five days ago. The photograph was still on his Instagram. @ConnorGoesGlobal. *These two beauties tho. KL is UNREAL.* The photograph showed the towers at night, silver against blue. Forty-seven likes. The photograph was the artefact of a person who no longer existed, the digital fossil of Connor Briggs the backpacker, Connor Briggs the man who had looked at the towers and seen content rather than context, who had seen an Instagram post rather than a city, who had seen a caption rather than a country with a legal system that would kill him for what was in the suitcase -- opened now on the highway shoulder in Perak, the lining cut, the vacuum bags exposed, the evidence that would be weighed and tested and entered into a file bearing his name and the section of the act he had violated, Section 39B, the section that began with *trafficking* and ended with *death*.

The towers continued to grow. KM 125. KM 100. KM 75.

The suburbs began. The highway was no longer cutting through plantation and jungle but through the metropolitan periphery of KL -- apartment blocks, housing estates, the geometric sprawl of a city that grew outward as well as upward, the residential rings surrounding the commercial core like the growth rings of a tree, each ring connected to the centre by the highway that was carrying him back into the city's heart.

Traffic thickened. The police vehicle slowed into the stop-start pattern of KL's highways during midday -- not the full gridlock of rush hour but the congested flow of a city with too many vehicles and not enough road, the traffic that KL's residents accepted the way they accepted humidity, as a permanent condition. The radio crackled occasionally -- a dispatcher's voice, Malay, call signs and codes. The driver responded once, briefly, three words. Connor did not understand them.

He did not ask where they were taking him. He knew. He had not been told -- the officers had not told him anything, had not announced a destination, had not narrated the journey the way journeys were narrated in police procedurals, with the detective in the front seat explaining the situation to the suspect in the back. The officers had said nothing. But Connor knew. The arrest had occurred in Perak, on the highway, at a checkpoint operated by the federal police. But the charge -- trafficking, Section 39B, the Dangerous Drugs Act -- was a matter for the narcotics division, and the narcotics division operated out of district headquarters, and the district headquarters for the area that included Petaling Street and Chinatown and the Lantern Hostel was Dang Wangi.

Dang Wangi.

The name had entered Connor's life on Day 23. Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail, Narcotics Division, Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters. The business card that Ahmad had handed him during the random street check on Bukit Bintang, the card that Connor had put in his wallet and then transferred to the pocket of his board shorts and then memorised without meaning to, the eleven digits becoming embedded in his memory the way song lyrics embedded themselves, through repetition and emotional association, the number becoming not just a sequence of digits but a talisman, a key, a line of communication to the one man in the system who had looked at Connor and seen not a tourist but a person in danger.

+60 3 2600 ####.

He had called that number twice. The first time, five rings to voicemail, nineteen seconds of silence on the recording, the message he couldn't leave, the words that wouldn't form. The second time, Ahmad's voice, live, the line open, three seconds of connection, three seconds in which the words could have come but didn't, the call ended by his own thumb on the red button, the thumb that had sealed his own fate with a gesture as small as ending a phone call.

And now he was being driven to Ahmad's station. In handcuffs. In the back of a police vehicle. With four hundred and fifty grams of methamphetamine attributed to his name and his passport number and the suitcase that was evidence and the evidence that was a death sentence and the death sentence that was the law of the country he was in, the law that he had been told about and warned about and shown and explained and printed out and handed to him, by Ahmad, by Razak, by Priya, by the warnings in the airport, by the warnings on the television, by the warnings that were everywhere in a country that believed that the warnings mattered, and he had refused, every time, with the machine's efficiency, the machine converting every warning into noise, every signal into static, every *you will die if you do this* into *relax, it's Asia*.

The irony was not lost on him. The irony was, in fact, the dominant feature of the drive -- more present than the landscape, more visible than the towers, more audible than the radio. The irony was the air in the vehicle, the substance that filled the space between the mesh partition and the rear window. The irony of arriving at the station where Ahmad worked, the station he could have walked into voluntarily at any point in the last twenty-four days, the station that Razak had told him to go to at seven AM, the station that had been twelve minutes by foot from the Lantern Hostel, twelve minutes that might have saved his life if he had walked them this morning instead of climbing the staircase to Felix's room and picking up the suitcase and riding a Grab to TBS and boarding a bus and sitting in seat 22B and watching a dog sit beside his suitcase on a highway in Perak.

Twelve minutes. The walk to Dang Wangi was twelve minutes. He had measured it once, on Day 23, after Ahmad had given him the card, standing on Petaling Street with his phone in his hand and using Google Maps to calculate the distance from the hostel's front door to the police headquarters' main entrance, the blue dot on the map and the red pin on the map and the line between them and the number beneath the line: 1.1 kilometres, eleven hundred metres, the distance a fit person could walk in twelve minutes, the distance that separated the Lantern Hostel from the office of the one man in the system who might have been able to intercede.

He had not walked those twelve minutes. He had driven four hundred kilometres in the opposite direction and was now driving four hundred kilometres back, and the net distance between himself and Dang Wangi was the same -- he was going to end up at the station regardless, was going to pass through the same doors, was going to be in the same building -- but the terms had changed. The walk would have made him a witness, a cooperator, a man who had come in voluntarily with information, and the drive was making him a suspect, a defendant, a man who had been arrested on a highway with enough methamphetamine to trigger the mandatory death penalty.

The terms. The language. The categories. The system had boxes. Witness. Suspect. Defendant. Convicted. Sentenced. You went into one box and the lid closed and the next box opened and you went in and the lid closed and the lids only closed one way. The word for one-way lids was *irreversible* and the word was a word Priya would have used and Priya was on a plane and the word was his now, the only thing she'd left him that was useful. And the category Connor was entering -- suspect, arrested, charged under Section 39B -- was a category from which the exits were limited and the most probable exit was not an exit at all but a terminus, a dead end, the end of the corridor, the last door that did not open from the inside.

KM 50. KM 25.

The city was here. The highway had become an elevated road, raised above the streets on concrete pillars, the view from the window now KL from above -- the rooftops of shophouses, the minarets of mosques, construction cranes standing like steel birds above building sites, the smoke from hawker stalls, the heat shimmer rising from asphalt, eight million people doing eight million things on a Friday afternoon.

The vehicle descended from the elevated road. Surface streets. Traffic lights. The geography becoming recognisable -- Jalan Tun Perak, the road that ran east-west through the city centre, the road Connor had walked on a dozen times. The vehicle turned. Jalan Dang Wangi. The street that shared its name with the police station that shared its name with the district.

The police station appeared.

Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters was a building that announced its function through architecture. Concrete and glass, institutional, modern in the way that government buildings were modern -- clean lines without elegance, functional surfaces without warmth, the aesthetic of efficiency applied to architecture with the result that the building looked exactly like what it was: a place where the machinery of law enforcement operated twenty-four hours a day, the building never dark, never empty, the lights always on because the work was never done.

The vehicle pulled into the rear entrance. A steel gate, painted grey, operated by a guard in a booth. The guard looked at the driver. The driver showed credentials. The gate opened. The vehicle entered an underground parking area -- concrete, lit by tubes overhead, the blue-white light of buildings where human beings were processed rather than welcomed.

The vehicle stopped. The engine died. The underground space had its own acoustic signature: the hum of ventilation, the echo of footsteps on concrete, the distant clang of a door, the drip of water from a pipe overhead. The sounds were hollow, reverberant, the raw sound of a building's infrastructure.

The officer in the passenger seat got out. He opened Connor's door -- the door that had no interior handle, the door that was the physical expression of custody, that opened only from outside.

"Keluar." *Get out.*

Connor got out. The movement was awkward -- the handcuffs restricted his arm movement, the chain catching on his thighs as he slid across the vinyl seat, his centre of gravity off because his hands couldn't brace against the doorframe, the body performing a simple action with the clumsy, degraded competence of a body whose primary tools were bound together.

He stood in the parking area. The concrete floor was cool through his Birkenstocks. The officers flanked him, one on each side, not touching him, the professional distance of escort -- close enough to intervene if the suspect ran, far enough to convey that the escort was procedure, not aggression. They walked to a door -- steel, painted grey, a keycard reader beside it. The driver swiped a card. The reader beeped. The door opened.

A corridor. The corridor was what corridors were in police stations: long, narrow, the light overhead a constant blue-white buzz, the walls painted a colour that might have been cream or might have been grey or might have been the colour that resulted from applying cream paint to grey walls and allowing twenty years of institutional use to blend the two into a third colour that existed only in government buildings, the colour of administration, the colour of function.

The corridor smelled of disinfectant -- commercial-grade, pine-scented, the scent designed to convey cleanliness rather than achieve it. Beneath the disinfectant, other smells: old sweat, coffee, and something fainter, something that Connor's body recognised before his mind could name it -- a tightening in the chest, a quickening of the pulse. The smell of a place where people were held. The smell of walls that had been breathed against by hundreds of people in handcuffs, the collective exhalation of fear and boredom absorbed by the paint and the concrete and released, slowly, into the corridor's air.

They walked past closed doors on both sides -- INTERVIEW ROOM 1, INTERVIEW ROOM 2, EVIDENCE STORAGE, ADMINISTRATION. Behind the doors, the muffled sounds of work: voices, keyboards, the ring of a phone. The sounds of a system that did not pause for the arrival of a new suspect because new suspects arrived constantly and the system's capacity to absorb them was the system's defining feature.

At the end of the corridor, a counter. High -- chest height, the kind of counter designed to separate the people behind it from the people in front of it, the architectural expression of a power differential, the counter that said *we are here* and *you are there* and the distance between here and there was not measured in metres but in authority. Behind it, a woman -- middle-aged, uniformed, seated at a computer that looked like it had been built in 2008 and had been performing the same function ever since. She looked up when Connor arrived. Her expression did not change. The expression of a person who processed arrivals the way a toll booth operator processed vehicles -- one at a time, in order, without commentary.

The escorting officer spoke to her in Malay. The conversation was brief, procedural -- name, charge, arresting location, time. The woman typed. The keyboard clattered with the old, mechanical rhythm of a woman who had typed thousands of bookings, the rhythm that turned the facts of Connor's arrest into data, into a file, into a case number.

The case number appeared on the screen. Connor couldn't see the screen -- the counter was too high, the screen angled toward the officer -- but the woman read it aloud to the escorting officer.

"DDW dash 2026 dash 04783."

DDW: Dang Wangi. 2026: the year. 04783: the four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-third case processed by this station in 2026. Connor was a number. The number was the system's name for him, the name that would appear on every document, every report, every court filing, every piece of paper that the system generated in the process of converting Connor James Briggs from a person into a case.

04783. He was the four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-third. The number was precise, indifferent, the counting of a system that counted everyone and treated the counting as the essential act, the act that brought the person into the system's awareness, the act that made the person real in the system's terms. Four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-two people had been processed before him in 2026 alone. Four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-two arrivals at this counter, this keyboard, this screen, this woman's hands.

---

Processing took one hour and fourteen minutes.

The processing was performed in a room adjacent to the booking counter -- a room designed for exactly this purpose, containing the tools and equipment required to record a person's physical and biographical details with the thoroughness that the law required. A desk, two chairs, a computer, a fingerprint scanner, a camera mounted on a tripod, a height chart painted on the wall, and the particular atmosphere of a room where thousands of people had been photographed and fingerprinted and measured and documented, the room's walls absorbing the repetition of the process the way the corridor's walls absorbed the smell of fear.

Fingerprinting came first.

A technician appeared -- not one of the escorting officers but a civilian employee, a young Malay man in a polo shirt and slacks, the uniform of a person who worked for the police without being police. His movements were automatic, practised -- the movements of a man who had fingerprinted hundreds of people and for whom the process was not dramatic but routine.

Connor's handcuffs were removed. The escorting officer produced a small universal key and turned it in the lock and the bracelets opened, right then left. The sensation was nothing. He had expected relief, the physical pleasure of unrestraint. But the cuffs had not been painful, and the removal of something that was not painful did not produce relief -- only the next condition, uncuffed hands in a room where the hands were uncuffed because the fingerprinting required flat, open palms.

The technician took Connor's right hand. The grip was firm but not aggressive, functional, existing only to position the hand correctly on the scanner's glass surface.

The scanner was electronic -- a flat glass plate connected to the computer, the technology that had replaced ink pads and paper cards with digital capture and algorithmic matching. Connor's fingers were pressed to the glass one at a time -- right thumb, right index, right middle, right ring, right little, then the left hand in the same sequence. Each finger held for three seconds while the scanner captured the print, the ridges and whorls digitised and stored, the unique pattern that had been left on every surface he had ever touched -- doorknobs and coffee cups and phone screens and the telescopic handle of a black hard-shell suitcase. Then palm prints. Then the edges of the hands, the surfaces the technician was thorough about because thoroughness was the standard and the standard did not vary.

The technician did not speak except to give instructions: "Right hand. Index finger. Press. Hold." The instructions were in English, simple, the reduced vocabulary of a process that required compliance rather than conversation. Connor complied. The compliance was automatic, the body performing the requested actions without the mind's engagement.

Photographing followed.

The camera was digital, mounted on a tripod at a fixed distance from the height chart on the wall. Connor was positioned against the chart. 185 centimetres. Six foot one.

"Face forward. No expression."

The instruction was unnecessary -- his face had no expression to suppress. His face was the face from the service area mirror at Tapah: thin, grey under the sunburn, the eyes bloodshot, the mouth a line. The face of a man who had been awake for thirty-two hours and had spent the last three in the back of a police vehicle watching the landscape of his freedom replay in reverse. The face was not performing an expression. The face was displaying its condition, which was the condition of a system that had exhausted its emotional inventory and was operating on the residual charge of biological processes that did not require emotional input -- breathing, standing, blinking, the autonomic functions that kept the body upright while the mind processed the incomprehensible.

The camera fired. Flash. The white light was sudden, total, filling the room for a fraction of a second. The photograph that would be attached to case file DDW-2026-04783, the photograph in which he was not @ConnorGoesGlobal and not a digital nomad and not a content creator but a suspect, a body, a face against a height chart, a data point in a system.

"Turn left."

He turned left. The camera fired. The profile -- the jawline, the stubble, the sun-bleached hair that was no longer a man-bun but loose, hanging to his shoulders, the hair that Priya had touched on the air well bench.

"Turn right." He turned right. The camera fired.

"Face forward again." One more photograph. Four images: front, left profile, right profile, front again. The four angles that the system required to document a face.

Personal details were recorded next. The woman behind the counter had begun the process; now it was completed in the processing room by the escorting officer, who sat across the desk from Connor with a form -- paper, actual paper, the form printed on the kind of institutional paper that government departments used, slightly thicker than printer paper and slightly thinner than card stock, designed to survive filing, the paper that would exist in a folder in a cabinet for decades.

The questions were procedural.

"Full name."
"Connor James Briggs."

"Date of birth."
"Fourteenth of March, 1999."

"Nationality."
"Australian."

"Passport number."
"PA7834521."

"Address in Malaysia."
A pause. The question required an answer and the answer was the address of a building that had been his home for forty-seven days and was no longer his home and was, in fact, one of the nodes in the network that had produced his arrest, the building where Felix had recruited him and the suitcase had been waiting.

"The Lantern Hostel. Twenty-eight Jalan Petaling. Kuala Lumpur."

The officer wrote. The pen scratched. The address joined the other details on the form -- the biographical facts in the language of the system, the language of nouns and numbers and the absence of adjectives, the language that did not care whether the man across the desk was arrogant or frightened or twenty-seven, the language that cared only about the fields on the form and the entries that filled them.

"Occupation."
"Self-employed. Freelance... social media."

The officer wrote. His expression did not change. And somewhere in his mind the old voice -- the vlog narrator, the caption machine -- observed that the form had no field for *arrogant ignorance* and no checkbox for *fatal flaw*, and the observation was the machine's ghost, the last flicker of a system that was already dead.

*She'll be right.* The thought arrived from the old world, from the machine's warehouse of stock phrases, and it had nothing to offer the present tense. It sat in his mind like a tourist in a courtroom, out of place, unequipped, ridiculous.

"Next of kin."
The words arrived and detonated. *Who should we call to tell them you've been arrested for a capital offence in Malaysia.*

"David and Karen Briggs. Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia."

He said his parents' names in a police processing room at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, and the saying was the first time the two worlds -- the world of his parents and the world of his arrest -- had intersected in speech, the names of his parents entering the file alongside the case number and the charge and the section of the act that described what would happen to their son.

His mother's face appeared in his mind. Not the face he saw on FaceTime calls -- the GP's face, professional and warm and slightly tilted to compensate for the laptop's angle. The other face. The face she made when she was worried, which was the face with the crease between her eyebrows and the compression of her lips and the eyes that went dark with the specific darkness of a mother who sensed that her child was in danger. The face she had made when he'd broken his arm at thirteen, falling off a skateboard at the Hawthorn velodrome. The face she would make when the phone rang at 3 AM Melbourne time and a voice said: *Mrs. Briggs, I'm calling from the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. It's about your son.*

He looked at the desk. The form. The pen. The officer's hand, writing. The details of his life reduced to fields and entries, the data that the system extracted from a person the way a machine extracted ore from rock -- the useful material separated from the surrounding substance, the substance discarded, the ore processed.

The handcuffs were reapplied. The same cuffs, the same wrists, the same steel. The click was the same -- small, precise, final. But this application was not the highway-shoulder application, in the open air under the Perak sun. This application was inside, in a room with the tube's blue-white glare and no windows and the form on the desk with his parents' names on it. The system's application, the one that said: *you are now inside the machine and the machine operates on its own schedule*.

---

His belongings were catalogued.

A plastic bag -- clear, large, the kind used by police departments worldwide for the storage of personal effects, the kind that had a white label on the front for the suspect's name and case number and the date and the officer responsible. The bag was placed on the desk. The escorting officer opened Connor's daypack -- the black daypack that he had carried through twelve countries, the daypack that contained the compressed inventory of a backpacker's daily life -- and began removing items, placing each on the desk, recording each on a separate form. The property inventory. The document that listed everything a person had on them at the time of their arrest, the document that was both inventory and evidence, both storage record and exhibit list.

The items appeared on the desk in the order they were extracted from the daypack -- the order random, determined by packing arrangement, but readable, retroactively, as a small archaeology of Connor's last morning as a free person:

One passport, Australian, issued 2022, expiring 2032. The officer opened it, checked the photo against Connor's face -- the photo three years old, the face younger, fuller, the hair shorter, the expression the neutral half-smile that passport photos required, the face of a man who could not have imagined that the passport's next stamp would be applied not by an immigration officer at an airport but by a custody officer at a police station.

One mobile phone, iPhone 14, black case, 12% battery. The phone was dark, the screen locked, the last communication a text from Felix that Connor had not replied to. The phone contained Connor's life -- his contacts, his photographs, his messages to Priya and his mother. It also contained the call log with the two calls to Ahmad's number, the evidence that Connor had tried to contact a narcotics officer and failed, the data that might, in a courtroom, distinguish the mule from the handler, the victim from the perpetrator.

One mobile phone, Nokia, silver, prepaid. The burner. The officer looked at it. The officer looked at Connor. His expression shifted -- not dramatically, but a recalibration, the recognition that a young tourist carrying two phones was not a standard configuration, that the second phone told a story the first phone didn't, the story of a person who was either an operative or a tool. He placed the burner beside the iPhone. Two phones. Two lives. Evidence.

One wallet, brown leather, worn. Contents: RM347 in cash, an Australian driver's licence (expired), two credit cards (one maxed, one inactive), a Lantern Hostel loyalty card (three stamps), a Rapid KL transit card, and a business card -- white, small, printed text:

*Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail*
*Narcotics Division*
*Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters*
*+60 3 2600 ####*

The officer extracted the business card and held it. He looked at it for four seconds, which was longer than any look he had given any other item. Then he looked at Connor. The card was data. The card was a connection between the suspect and a narcotics officer at this station -- the same station where the suspect was being processed -- the connection raising questions that the officer's expression acknowledged but did not voice. The questions of when and how and why a tourist arrested for trafficking had the business card of a narcotics sergeant in his wallet, the questions that the card posed and that the card could not answer and that the system would eventually extract from Connor himself, in an interview room, with a recorder running, the questions that would determine whether the card was evidence of cooperation attempted or evidence of corruption discovered.

The officer placed the card on the desk. He recorded it on the inventory form. The card joined the other items -- the passport, the phones, the wallet, the cash -- in the record of Connor's possessions at the time of arrest.

One water bottle, plastic, half-full. Recorded. Placed in the bag.

One phone charger, genuine. Not a charger box from Wei's shop, not a hollow shell containing methamphetamine, but an actual phone charger, the real one, the charger that charged phones and nothing else. The officer examined it with care -- turning it in his hands, checking the seams, the weight, the heft that distinguished a genuine charger from the weighted replicas that the narcotics division had been finding in hostels for years. The officer was satisfied. The charger was recorded, placed in the bag.

One packet of Mamee noodle snacks, opened, half-eaten. The remnant of the service area at Tapah, the last thing Connor had eaten as a free person, the dry noodles that had tasted like nothing because his mouth had already been dry with the taste of dread. Recorded. Placed in the bag.

One blue Sea to Summit microfibre travel towel. Folded in the compact square that Connor always used, the fold that turned the rectangular towel into a square that fit in a daypack side pocket. The towel was blue -- the specific blue of the Sea to Summit brand, the blue that was not navy and not royal and not sky but the blue of travel, the blue of hostels. The companion of twelve countries. The lightest thing in the daypack and the heaviest thing in Connor's life.

The officer recorded it on the inventory form. He placed it with the other items.

Then -- a deviation.

The door opened. A guard entered -- not one of the escorting officers but a different man, uniformed, the uniform of a custody officer rather than a patrol officer, the distinction visible in the lack of equipment on the belt, the custody officer carrying keys rather than weapons. He was Malay, middle-aged. He looked at the items on the desk. He looked at the blue towel. He picked it up.

"Ini untuk dia." *This is for him.*

The officer behind the desk looked up. The look was brief -- an exchange between two men in the system, a communication that operated in the coded language of procedure and precedent and the understood shortcuts of a building where everyone knew the protocols and the deviations from the protocols.

The officer nodded. The nod authorised the deviation.

The guard took the towel. It was not placed in the plastic bag with the other items. It was held separately, carried by the guard, taken out of the inventory process and into a different process, a process that the inventory form would not record, a process that the system would later claim did not happen.

The plastic bag was sealed. The label was completed in black marker: BRIGGS, CONNOR JAMES. DDW-2026-04783. The date. The officer's signature. The bag contained the passport, the phones, the wallet, the charger, the water bottle, the noodles. The bag did not contain the towel. The bag was placed in a locker behind the counter -- a metal locker, one of a row of identical lockers, each containing the sealed bag of a processed suspect, each bag a compressed life, a person reduced to items. The locker was closed. The key was turned.

Connor watched the towel leave the room in the guard's hands. He did not question it. He did not say: *that should be in the bag*. He did not say: *the protocol requires that all personal items be catalogued and stored together*. He did not say anything because he did not know the protocol and because the towel leaving the room was, in the hierarchy of things happening to him, so far below the arrest and the charge and the mandatory death penalty and the case number and the mugshot and his parents' names on the form that the towel's disposition was invisible, a detail lost in the avalanche of details, a leaf in a flood.

But the towel was not a detail. The towel was not a leaf. The towel was the instrument of his death, and the guard who carried it knew this, and the officer who nodded knew this, and somewhere in the system -- above the guard and above the officer and above the station and the district and the division -- someone had given an order, and the order had travelled through the network the way orders travel through networks, through intermediaries and coded language and the understood channels of a system that was not one system but two, the official system that processed suspects according to law and the unofficial system that processed problems according to necessity, and the necessity, in this case, was the silencing of a mule who knew names and faces and locations and who would, given time and fear and the pressure of a capital charge, tell everything to anyone who would listen.

The towel left the room. The towel was gone. The towel would return.

---

The cell was at the end of a different corridor -- deeper in the building, below the ground floor, the corridor that led to the holding cells, the cells where suspects were kept in the hours and days between arrest and arraignment. The corridor was narrower than the one above, the walls closer, the ceiling lower, the fluorescent tubes producing a different quality of light: not illumination but surveillance, the light designed not to help people see but to ensure that people could be seen, the light that served the watchers rather than the watched.

Steel doors with small reinforced windows lined one side -- the windows at eye level, allowing guards to look in without opening the door. Connor did not look through them as he passed.

The guard stopped at the last door. Steel, painted cream-grey, the paint chipped at the edges where the door had been opened and closed thousands of times, silver crescents of bare metal showing at the handle and the frame. The door had a number: C-7.

Bed 7. Cell 7. The numbers recurring with the insistence of a motif.

The guard unlocked the door. The key was large -- not the small universal handcuff key but a proper cell key, attached to a ring attached to a chain attached to the guard's belt, the key that was always on the guard the way the handcuffs were always on the prisoner, the complementary accessories of a system built on the binary of lock and key, held and holder.

The lock turned. The door opened inward, revealing the cell in stages: grey concrete floor, grey concrete walls, a fluorescent tube mounted in a wire cage on the ceiling, the light always on because the protocol did not distinguish between day and night, did not care that the human body required darkness for sleep, cared only that the guard could look through the window at any hour and see the contents of the cell.

Three metres by three metres. Nine square metres. The size of a space that was not designed for habitation but for holding -- habitation implied comfort, holding implied temporary containment.

A steel bench bolted to the wall -- the cell's only furniture, the bed, the chair, the table, the surface that served all purposes because it was the only surface. The steel was cold, conducting the building's subterranean coolness, the constant fifteen or sixteen degrees that existed beneath the earth's surface regardless of the tropical heat above.

The front wall was not a wall but bars -- steel, vertical, painted institutional green, the green that was chosen because green was considered calming and calming was considered useful in a setting where the occupants were not calm. The bars were spaced ten centimetres apart, permeable to everything except the human body.

A squat toilet in the corner. Stainless steel, floor-mounted, no seat, no lid, no privacy, visible from the corridor through the bars.

No window. The cell had no window. The walls were solid on three sides and bars on the fourth and none contained an opening to the outside. The cell existed in the building's interior, and the outside -- sky, air, city, weather, the sun's position that indicated the time of day -- was absent, removed with the totality that only architecture could achieve.

The fluorescent tube buzzed. Not a hum but a buzz -- the sound of electricity struggling through an aging ballast, the sound of a system degrading. The buzz filled the cell, the cell's dominant sound, the ambient frequency of the space. Through the bars, faintly, the distant sounds of the station: a door closing, a voice speaking Malay, the ring of a telephone. But these sounds arrived diminished, muted, the outside world present but reduced.

The buzz was everything. The buzz was the cell.

The guard removed Connor's handcuffs. The same key, the same procedure, the same absence of sensation at the removal. Connor's wrists were free. The wrists bore faint marks -- not bruises, not the red welts of tight cuffs, but the pale indentations of steel that had rested against skin for three hours, the temporary impressions that would fade in an hour but that were, for now, the physical evidence of the drive, the marks that said: *these wrists were held*.

"Masuk." *Go in.*

Connor entered the cell. The step across the threshold was the step from the corridor into the cell, from the space of transit to the space of containment, from the space where movement was possible -- escorted, directed, controlled, but possible -- to the space where movement was limited to nine square metres and the four actions that nine square metres permitted: sitting, standing, lying, and pacing, the four activities that would constitute Connor's physical existence for as long as the system kept him here.

The guard held out the towel.

The blue towel. The Sea to Summit microfibre towel that had been extracted from the inventory process and carried down the corridor to this cell. The towel that should have been in the plastic bag in the locker with the passport and the phones. The towel that was here, in the guard's hands, being offered like a hotel amenity placed on the bed by housekeeping for the comfort of the guest.

"For comfort," the guard said. The English was accented, the phrase rehearsed, the words said with the particular intonation of a man delivering a line he'd been told to deliver, the words originating somewhere above the guard in the hierarchy, somewhere in the system that had decided Connor Briggs should have his towel in his cell and that its presence should be framed as a kindness.

Connor took the towel. The taking was automatic -- hands closing on the microfibre with the muscle memory of four years of picking up this towel in hostels and bathrooms and beaches, the hands that knew this towel better than they knew any other object in the world.

The guard stepped back. The door closed. The lock turned. The key withdrew.

Connor was alone.

---

He stood in the centre of the cell for a long time.

The standing was not a decision -- the standing was the default, the condition the body adopted when no other condition was selected, the body remaining upright because upright was where it had been when the door closed and the door closing had not included an instruction to sit or lie down. He stood and the fluorescent tube buzzed and the cell was nine square metres and the towel was in his hands and the door was locked and the bars were green and the walls were grey and the light was on and the light would not turn off, the artificial white that said: *you are inside now, and inside has its own light, and the light does not set*.

He sat on the bench. The steel was cold. The cold penetrated his board shorts and reached his skin and the skin contracted, the goosebumps forming on his thighs, the body's mechanical response to temperature, the response that was independent of fear and grief and the crushing, tidal weight of what had happened and was happening and would happen. He sat and the cold was there and the cold was the bench's only quality, the bench having no other quality to offer, the bench being steel and flat and cold and bolted to the wall and the floor with the permanence of something that had been there before Connor arrived and would be there after he left and had been there for every occupant of Cell C-7 since the cell had been built.

He looked at the walls. The walls were close. Three metres was not far. Three metres was the distance from the bench to the bars, the distance from the bench to the opposite wall, the distance that the cell permitted in any direction. Three metres was six paces for a man of Connor's height. Six paces forward, six paces back. The pacing that prisoners did, the back-and-forth that was not exercise but the body's rebellion against stillness, the body's insistence that it was designed for movement, for the open passage through space that characterised freedom.

He did not pace. He sat. The sitting was the acceptance of the space, the body adapting to the cell the way water adapted to a container, assuming the shape of its confinement, filling the available volume without resistance. The body adapted. The mind did not.

The mind was still on the highway. Still in seat 22B, watching the dog sit beside the suitcase, the handler saying *positif*, the word dividing his life into two periods: the before in which anything was possible and the after in which only one thing was possible, which was this -- a bench in a cell in Kuala Lumpur with a blue towel in his hands.

Time passed. He did not know how much. The cell had no clock, no window. Only the fluorescent tube, which produced the same light at all hours, the light that was the same at noon as at midnight, erasing time by refusing to acknowledge it, creating a permanent, buzzing present.

The sounds of the station reached him through the bars. The sounds were the sounds of a building operating: doors, voices, footsteps, the occasional ring of a telephone, the distant drone of traffic from the street above. The sounds were the sounds of the world continuing, the world that existed outside the cell and outside the building, the world where people walked and drove and ate and talked and did the things that people did when they were free to do things. The world that Connor had occupied this morning and would never occupy again in the same way, the world that had been his and was now theirs, the world belonging to the people who were not in cells.

And then, from somewhere above, from somewhere outside the building, through the concrete and the steel and the institutional architecture, through the bars and the corridor and the walls of Cell C-7, a sound arrived that was different from the station's sounds.

The call to prayer.

The adhan. The muezzin's voice from a nearby mosque -- perhaps Masjid Jamek, the mosque whose call Connor had heard every morning from Bed 7, the call that entered the Lantern Hostel through the air well at 5:32 AM, the call he had slept through and complained about and eventually stopped hearing, the way a person stopped hearing a sound that was constant.

But this was not the morning call. This was the Asr prayer, the afternoon prayer, the third of the five daily prayers, and the call was the only temporal information the cell had provided -- the muezzin's voice serving as a clock that the cell itself refused to be. A temporal anchor, a fixed point in the day's chronology, the sound that said: *it is this time, you are in this hour, the day has reached this point and will continue to the next*.

The Arabic syllables, ancient and melodic, filled the nine square metres with a sound larger than the space, a sound designed for open air and minarets now compressed into a concrete cell, the muezzin's voice arriving filtered, changed, carrying the imprint of every surface it had passed through to reach Connor's ears.

The call ended. The buzz returned. The cell's permanent condition.

---

Footsteps in the corridor.

Connor looked up. Through the bars, visible in the corridor's blue-white light, a figure approached. An officer -- different from the guard, different from the escorting officers, a new figure, uniformed, carrying a clipboard. The clipboard was the accessory of a man who moved between cells delivering information, a man whose function was to notify and not to converse, to inform and not to discuss, to deposit the system's decisions at the bars of each cell and then to move to the next cell and the next decision.

The officer stopped at the bars. He looked at Connor through the green steel. The look was professional, the look of a man performing a duty that the schedule required.

"Your embassy will be notified. Tomorrow."

The words were in English. The words were a statement, not a conversation. Information delivered in the format of the system -- declarative, temporal, the what and the when, the content and the schedule.

"Tomorrow?" Connor said. The word came out raw, the voice unused since the processing room, the vocal cords producing it with the rough sound of a voice that had been silent for hours. "Can I -- I need to call -- my embassy. The Australian High Commission. I need to --"

"Tomorrow."

The word was the same word. The same syllables, the same stress, the same intonation. The word was not a denial -- the word was a schedule. The schedule said tomorrow. The schedule did not say now. The schedule did not accommodate urgency or fear or the desperate need of a man in a cell to hear the voice of someone who represented the country on his passport, the country that was thirty-seven hundred miles away and that was, in the hierarchy of Connor's hopes, the last hope, the institutional hope, the hope that a government office in a foreign city could intervene in the legal system of another foreign city and produce a different outcome.

"A lawyer. I need a lawyer. I have the right to --"

"Tomorrow."

The officer's expression did not change. The expression was the expression of a man delivering a schedule, and the schedule was the schedule, and the schedule did not change because the suspect repeated his request, because repetition was not a variable that the schedule responded to. The schedule responded only to time, and time moved at its own pace, and its pace was not Connor's pace.

The officer left. The footsteps receded down the corridor. The corridor door opened and closed. The sound of closing was the sound of separation, the sound of the distance between inside and outside increasing by the thickness of a door, the sound that said: *you are here and the world is there and the door is between you*.

Tomorrow. The embassy tomorrow. The lawyer tomorrow. Everything tomorrow.

Connor sat on the bench. The steel was still cold. The cold was permanent, the cold of a metal that conducted heat away from the body faster than the body could produce it, the cold that would not warm because the steel's thermal mass was greater than the body's thermal output, the steel always winning, the steel always cold.

He looked at the towel in his hands. The towel was blue. The towel was familiar. The towel was the one thing in the cell that was his, that had been his before the cell and before the arrest and before the suitcase and before Felix and before the Lantern Hostel, the one thing that predated the story, the one thing that belonged to the life before.

He unfolded the towel. The compact square became a rectangle, approximately sixty centimetres by one hundred and twenty centimetres, the size designed to dry a body without occupying excessive space in a pack, the size large enough to wrap around shoulders, around waists, in hostels and on beaches and in the life that towels belonged to.

He brought the towel to his face.

The smell hit him and the smell was the past.

Sunscreen. The specific, chemical-sweet smell of SPF 50, the Australian-brand sunscreen his mother had shipped him in a care package six months ago, the sunscreen absorbed by the towel's microfibre over weeks of use, the smell that was simultaneously protection and her worry, the worry that could be addressed by sending sunscreen but not by sending sense. Beneath the sunscreen, salt -- the South China Sea, the Andaman Sea, the ghost of every ocean he had swum in, the chemical trace that the sea left on everything it touched. And beneath the salt, cheap hostel laundry detergent, the universal solvent of the backpacker circuit, the scent that smelled the same whether you were in Kuala Lumpur or Chiang Mai or Phnom Penh.

The towel smelled like his life. The towel smelled like twelve countries and four years and the person he had been before the person he had become, and the distance between the two persons was not measured in kilometres but in decisions, the decisions that had led him from a beach in Bali to a cell in Kuala Lumpur, the decisions that had been made not all at once but incrementally, one at a time, each decision small enough to be dismissed and large enough to matter, each decision a step on a staircase that descended from the sunlight into the underground, from the blue towel on the beach to the blue towel in the cell.

He wrapped the towel around his shoulders.

The wrapping was instinctive -- the gesture of a man who was cold and had a fabric, the gesture of a child wrapping a blanket around themselves, the gesture that said: *the world is too large and I am making it smaller, I am creating a space within the space, a warmth within the cold*. The towel was thin -- microfibre was thin, designed for compactness rather than insulation. It did not provide significant warmth. But it provided the sensation of something against the skin that was not steel and not concrete and not the institutional surfaces of the cell, something soft and familiar that carried, in its fibres, the chemical memory of a life that had been lived in sunlight.

He sat on the bench with the towel around his shoulders and the fluorescent tube buzzing above him and the bars green in front of him and the walls grey around him and the corridor beyond the bars and the building beyond the corridor and the city beyond the building and his mother in Hawthorn, thirty-seven hundred miles away, probably in her surgery right now, seeing patients, checking blood pressure, prescribing antibiotics, doing the things that GPs did on a Friday afternoon, not knowing, not yet knowing, not knowing until the phone rang at 3 AM.

The fluorescent tube buzzed. The buzz was the cell's only voice. The buzz was the sound of waiting, the sound of the system's clock, the sound that said: *tomorrow*. Tomorrow the embassy. Tomorrow the lawyer. Tomorrow the legal process that would begin with the charge and end with the sentence and the sentence would be determined by the law and the law was Section 39B and Section 39B was the death penalty and the death penalty was the end of the corridor, the last door, the door that did not open.

But tomorrow was on the other side of a night that had not yet begun, a night that would be spent on a steel bench under a fluorescent tube that did not turn off, in a cell with no window and no clock and no darkness and no way to measure the passage of time except by the calls to prayer from outside -- Maghrib at sunset, Isha at night, Fajr at dawn -- the prayers that were the city's heartbeat, the only clock that penetrated the walls of Cell C-7.

Connor pulled the towel tighter around his shoulders. The microfibre conformed to his body, a thin blue membrane between him and the cell's air, the towel performing its final function, the function it had not been designed for but that it had arrived at through the logic of a story that had been forty-seven days in the making.

He closed his eyes. The fluorescent light was visible through his eyelids -- not as light but as a red-orange glow, the blood-filtered luminance of closed eyes under strong light, the glow that said: *the light is still on, the light is always on, the light does not care that your eyes are closed*.

He opened his eyes. The light was there. The buzz was there. The cell was there.

He was there.

Connor James Briggs, twenty-seven, Australian, passport number PA7834521, case number DDW-2026-04783, charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, held in Cell C-7 at Dang Wangi District Police Headquarters, sitting on a steel bench with a blue towel around his shoulders, waiting for tomorrow.

Tomorrow, which was a word that the system had given him. Tomorrow, which was a promise that was also a deferral. Tomorrow, which was both hope and its absence, both the promise of action and the guarantee of delay, the word that kept him alive because alive was the condition of waiting for tomorrow and dead was the condition of tomorrow never coming.

The fluorescent tube buzzed.

The cell breathed.

Connor waited.

And somewhere outside the building, beyond the concrete and the steel and the bars painted green, beyond the corridor and the door and the parking area and the street, the city continued. KL continued. The traffic flowed. The hawker stalls sizzled. The Petronas Towers stood in the afternoon light. The call to prayer would come again -- Maghrib, at sunset, the fourth prayer, the prayer that marked the end of the day and the beginning of the night, and the night would come.

The night would be fluorescent and buzzing and nine square metres of grey concrete and green bars and a steel bench and a blue towel and the sound of a building that was never quiet and the light that was never off and the permanent, endless, institutional present of Cell C-7.

And after the night, tomorrow.

If tomorrow came.

*End of Chapter 32*
