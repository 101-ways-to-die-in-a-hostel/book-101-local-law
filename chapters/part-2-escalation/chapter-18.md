# Chapter 18: Jake Leaves

Jake announced it over breakfast on Day 35, between bites of Mama Siti's nasi lemak, with the casual finality of a man who made life decisions the way other people chose between menu items.

"Dude, I'm going to Langkawi."

Connor's fork paused. "When?"

"Tomorrow. I booked a flight last night. AirAsia, forty-seven ringgit. That's, like, twelve dollars. This country is insane."

He said it with the wide-eyed appreciation of a man who had discovered that the world was cheaper than San Diego and had decided this was the world's primary virtue. His backwards cap was on. His fake Supreme shirt -- the one Connor had bought him at the night market a lifetime ago -- was spotted with sambal. He was grinning.

"What about Chiara?" Connor asked.

"Chiara's in Penang. She texted me. She wants me to meet her in Langkawi next week. We're going to do this, like, island-hopping thing. Jet skis. Snorkelling. She knows a guy who rents a boat for fifty ringgit a day. A whole boat, dude."

Jake said *a whole boat* the way medieval explorers must have said *a whole continent* -- with the awed reverence of a man for whom scale was always surprising and always delightful.

Connor ate his nasi lemak. The rice was perfect -- coconut-infused, fluffy, the sambal adding heat in waves. Mama Siti was at the stove, stirring something that smelled of lemongrass and the deep, amber warmth of star anise. She didn't look at the boys. She was listening, though. She was always listening.

"How long?" Connor asked.

"I dunno. A week? Two? However long the money lasts." Jake shrugged. The shrug was his primary mode of planning -- the physical expression of a man whose relationship with the future was noncommittal. "You should come, dude. Langkawi's supposed to be sick. Duty-free island. The beer is, like, nothing."

"Duty-free beer." Connor managed a smile. "You're basically describing paradise."

"Right? So come."

"Can't. I've got work stuff. The social media gig."

"The social media gig." Jake said it with the faint puzzlement of a man who had never understood what Connor did for money and had accepted this ignorance the way he accepted most things -- cheerfully, without investigation. "Dude, you can post Instagrams from anywhere. That's literally the point."

"Yeah, but I've got the local clients too. The import-export thing."

"Oh right. Felix's thing." Jake took another bite of nasi lemak, chewed, swallowed. "Is that, like, going well?"

"Yeah. It's good. Steady."

"Cool." Jake nodded with the benign approval of a man for whom all work was equally mysterious. "Felix is a legend. That guy knows everyone."

"He does."

"You know what's funny? He asked me about it once. The delivery thing. Like, a few weeks ago. Said he could use another runner."

Connor's chest tightened. The sensation was brief -- a constriction, a flash of cold, the body's response to information the mind hadn't caught up with. "Felix asked you?"

"Yeah. On the rooftop. One night after Changkat. He was saying how the business was growing and he needed reliable people. I was going to do it but then Chiara happened and I kinda forgot." He laughed. "Classic me."

Classic Jake. Classic, golden-retriever, limbic-system-driven Jake, who had avoided recruitment into a drug trafficking network not through intelligence or caution or awareness but through the accidental intervention of an Italian bartender named Chiara who had great hair and a friend with a boat.

Connor looked at Jake. Jake was eating. Jake was happy. Jake was leaving tomorrow for an island where the beer was cheap and the jet skis were available and the most dangerous thing on the horizon was sunburn. Jake was getting out.

The realisation settled into Connor with the weight of something obvious that he'd somehow missed: Jake was getting out because Jake was leaving. The hostel, Felix, the packages, the schedule -- none of it could reach Jake on Langkawi. Langkawi was outside the network. Langkawi was outside the geography of drops and pickups and men who didn't make eye contact. Langkawi was free.

*I could go too.*

The thought arrived with a clarity that startled him. He could go. Tomorrow. He could book a forty-seven-ringgit flight and sit next to Jake on an AirAsia seat and be in Langkawi by afternoon and the schedule would be broken and Felix would be left with one fewer courier and the packages would be someone else's problem and Connor would be on a beach drinking duty-free beer and the fear would dissolve in salt water and sunlight.

He could go.

"Mate." Jake was looking at him. "You alright? You've gone weird."

"Yeah. Fine. Just thinking."

"Don't think too hard. That's my rule. Thinking leads to deciding and deciding leads to consequences and consequences are a whole thing."

The philosophy of Jake Porter, distilled to its essence: avoid consequences by avoiding decisions. It was absurd. It was also, in this specific moment, the most compelling argument for action that Connor had heard.

"Maybe I'll come," Connor said. "Let me think about it."

"Sick! We can share a room. I found a place on Booking.com -- a beach hut. Sixty ringgit a night. It has a hammock, dude. A *hammock*."

Jake said *hammock* the way Connor said *content* -- as though the word itself contained a lifestyle, a philosophy, a complete vision of what life should be.

They finished breakfast. Jake went upstairs to pack, which for Jake meant throwing everything he owned into a duffel bag with the systematic approach of a man throwing confetti. Connor sat at the kitchen counter with his empty banana leaf and thought about Langkawi.

---

He went to Felix's room at eleven.

The door was open. Felix was at his desk, laptop open, the screen angled away from the door. He looked up when Connor appeared, and the smile arrived -- warm, inclusive, the Felix smile that made you feel like the most important person in the building.

"Morning, Connor. Come in."

Connor stepped inside. The room was tidy, as always. The bed made. The shutters partially closed, the slats casting horizontal lines of light across the floor that looked like the bars of something Connor chose not to name. On the desk, beside the laptop, a phone -- not Felix's usual phone but a different one, a phone Connor hadn't seen before, matte black, no case, the screen dark but angled toward Felix's hand with the casual proximity of an object that was used often and urgently. It was the kind of phone Connor recognised because he had one too -- the burner, the second device, the phone that belonged to the other life. But Felix's second phone was different from Connor's second phone in the way a general's radio was different from a foot soldier's walkie-talkie: same technology, different altitude. Felix's second phone spoke to the people above. Connor's second phone received instructions from Felix. The hierarchy was in the hardware. Felix closed the laptop as Connor sat on the bed.

"Jake's leaving," Connor said. "Tomorrow. Langkawi."

"I know. He told me last night." Felix's expression was neutral -- the neutrality of a man receiving information he already possessed. "It's a good island. He'll enjoy it."

"He said you asked him about the delivery work."

Felix paused. The pause was imperceptible to anyone who wasn't watching for it, a fraction of a second in which the machine behind Felix's eyes recalibrated. "I mentioned it. Casually. He wasn't interested."

"He was interested. He just got distracted."

"Jake gets distracted by many things." Felix smiled. "It's his charm and his survival mechanism. He's too scattered to be useful. I recognised that early."

The sentence was clinical, delivered with the diagnostic precision of a man who assessed people the way a mechanic assessed engines -- for function, for reliability, for the probability of breakdown. Jake was unreliable. Therefore Jake was not recruited. Therefore Jake was safe.

Connor felt something move in his chest -- a cold thread of understanding, pulling tight. Felix had looked at both of them -- Connor and Jake -- and chosen Connor. Not because Connor was smarter, or braver, or more qualified. Because Connor was more vulnerable. Because Connor was broke and desperate and wanted to belong and would do what he was told and would not ask questions and would carry the packages and accept the money and call it logistics.

Felix had chosen him the way a predator chose prey: not the fastest, not the strongest, but the one most likely to follow.

"I was thinking about going with Jake," Connor said.

The words came out before the machine could stop them. They emerged from the territory that the machine hadn't yet colonised -- the shrinking, gasping territory of honest impulse, the last corner of Connor's consciousness where self-preservation still had a foothold.

Felix looked at him. The smile didn't vanish -- it thinned, the warmth drawing back from the surface like a tide retreating, revealing the architecture beneath. The architecture was not warm. The architecture was structural, functional, designed to bear weight.

"Going to Langkawi," Felix said. Not a question.

"Maybe. For a week or two. Jake's got a place--"

"What about the schedule?"

"I'd pause it. Come back after."

"The schedule doesn't pause, Connor." Felix's voice was level, measured, the German accent precise. "The clients expect deliveries. If you disappear for two weeks, I have to find someone else. And finding someone else takes time. Training time. Trust-building time. The network doesn't run on holidays."

The word *network* landed in the room like something dropped from a height. Felix had never used the word before. In his careful lexicon, the operation was always *the business*, *the work*, *the clients*. *Network* was a different word. *Network* implied structure, hierarchy, scale. *Network* implied something larger than two men and a schedule.

"I'm not talking about a holiday," Connor said. "I'm talking about a week. Maybe two."

"And I'm telling you that the clients won't wait a week." Felix leaned forward, elbows on his knees, the posture of a man about to deliver information he'd rather not deliver. "Connor, I've invested in you. Time, trust, money. You're the KL leg of a chain that runs to Penang and Singapore. If the KL leg goes dark, the whole chain stops. And when the chain stops, the people above me ask questions."

"The people above you?"

"The company. The management. Import-export doesn't run itself."

The correction was swift, smooth, the mask repositioned before the gap had fully opened. But the gap had opened, and Connor had seen through it -- briefly, incompletely, the way you see a room through a door that opens and closes in a draught. The room behind the door contained people Felix answered to. People who asked questions when the chain stopped. People who were not photographers, not backpackers, not the kind of people you met in hostels.

"I can't stop you from going to Langkawi," Felix said. His voice softened. The warmth returned, modulated, controlled. "But I'd ask you to think about it. The schedule is working. The money is good. You've built something here -- a routine, a life, a system that works. Langkawi is a week on a beach. This is a career."

A career. The word was grotesque and seductive simultaneously, the way all the best lies were. A career in carrying packages you'd never opened, for people you'd never met, through a city that would kill you for carrying them. The career counsellors at Monash University had never mentioned this option.

"Think about it," Felix said. "Sleep on it. And tomorrow, when Jake leaves, if you still want to go, I won't stop you. But I hope you'll stay."

The word *hope* performed its function. It was a word that implied vulnerability, that suggested Felix needed Connor rather than owned him, that recast the relationship as partnership rather than employment. *I hope you'll stay.* As though Connor were a guest at a dinner party, free to leave at any time, the door right there, the evening entirely optional.

Felix smiled. The smile was warm. The shutters filtered the midday sun into thin, pale lines that had narrowed since Connor sat down, or seemed to have narrowed -- the room contracting by imperceptible degrees, the walls holding their position but the air between them thickening, the temperature climbing despite the fan that turned overhead with the slow, indifferent rotation of something measuring time rather than moving it. The matte black phone sat on the desk. The laptop sat beside it, closed, its secrets sealed. The bed Connor was sitting on was made with hotel precision, the sheets tucked so tightly they could have been stitched to the mattress, and the tightness of the sheets was the tightness of the room was the tightness of the conversation -- everything held in place, everything contained, everything neat and functional and impossible to escape without making a mess that Felix would not tolerate.

Connor stood. "I'll think about it," he said, and the sentence was already a concession, because *I'll think about it* was the language of a man who had already decided and needed the fiction of deliberation to make the decision feel like one.

"Good," Felix said. He didn't stand. He didn't need to. The room had done its work.

And in the silence between Felix's hope and Connor's indecision, the trap closed another inch, the way traps closed -- not with a snap but with a settling, a gentle, incremental tightening that felt like gravity and looked like choice.

---

Jake left the next morning.

The goodbye was at the front door of the Lantern Hostel, in the early heat, with the morning sounds of Petaling Street providing the soundtrack -- vendor calls, motorcycle engines, the distant prayer from Masjid Jamek. Jake's duffel bag was enormous and poorly packed, bulging in organic shapes that suggested the contents had been organised by chaos theory.

"Dude. Come with me." Jake said it one more time, standing on the pavement, his Grab waiting, the backwards cap slightly askew. "Last chance. Hammock. Duty-free beer. Chiara's friend has a *boat*."

"I can't, mate. The work."

"The work will be here when you get back."

"I know. But the clients--"

"Connor." Jake was not, as a rule, a man who used people's names with emphasis. The emphasis meant something. "You look tired, dude. Like, not body tired. Brain tired. You look like someone who needs a beach."

"I'm fine."

"You always say you're fine. That's, like, your whole thing. 'I'm fine, mate. She'll be right.' But I'm watching you and you're not fine. You're doing this thing where you smile but your eyes don't move, and that's -- I don't know what that is, but it's not fine."

Jake Porter, who never noticed anything, had noticed something. This was perhaps the most alarming development of the past five weeks, more alarming than the checkpoint or the photographs or the printed law. If Jake could see it -- Jake, who navigated the world with the observational acuity of a golden retriever in a butterfly garden -- then the thing that was happening to Connor was no longer subtle. It was visible. It was on the surface. It was leaking through the mask.

"I'm fine," Connor said. "Have an epic time. Send me photos."

"I'll send you so many photos. My Instagram story is going to be, like, forty slides of just ocean."

They hugged. The bro hug -- one arm, two back-pats, the choreography of male affection that allowed intimacy without admitting to it. Jake smelled of sunscreen and the hostel's communal soap and something that was just Jake, the irreducible essence of a man who had never been complicated enough to be in danger.

Jake got in the Grab. The car pulled away. Connor stood on the pavement and watched it turn onto Jalan Sultan and disappear into the morning traffic, and he kept watching after it disappeared, the way you watch the space where a plane was after it passes behind a cloud, as though the watching could maintain the connection that the distance was dissolving.

The morning sounds of Petaling Street filled the space Jake had occupied. A vendor three doors down was unrolling a tarpaulin over a table of counterfeit watches, the fabric snapping in the breeze from a passing truck. The motorcycle repair shop across the lane was already running its compressor, the pneumatic hiss rising and falling like mechanical breathing. Someone was frying something -- oil crackling, the smell of garlic and dried chillies hitting the heat, the specific morning smell of Chinatown waking up and getting to work. The sounds were the same sounds Connor heard every morning. But the sounds had always been background -- texture, atmosphere, the ambient noise of a life he was living inside. Now the sounds were foreground, because the foreground was empty, because the person who had stood in it was gone.

He remembered the first night Jake had arrived at the Lantern, three weeks ago -- stumbling through the front door at eleven PM with the duffel bag and the backwards cap and the bewildered grin of a man who had been delivered to the wrong address and decided to stay. Connor had been on the rooftop with Felix, and Jake had appeared at the top of the stairs and said, "Dude, is this the hostel with the good breakfast? A guy at the airport told me to come here. I think he might have been lying." He hadn't been lying. And Jake had stayed, and for three weeks Jake had been the person Connor could sit with and not perform for, the person who required nothing except company and beer and the occasional reassurance that things were, indeed, "sick."

Now the pavement was empty. The Grab was gone. The morning continued without interruption.

The street was the same street it always was: vendors, tourists, motorbikes, the red doors of the temple, the phone repair shop with its fluorescent light. But something had changed. Something had been removed from the equation, and the equation now balanced differently.

Jake had been the last uncomplicated thing in Connor's life. The last person who knew him without suspecting him, who liked him without diagnosing him, who spent time with him without trying to save him. Jake was the mirror that showed Connor the version of himself he wanted to be -- the traveler, the adventurer, the mate. Without Jake, the mirror was gone, and what remained was the version that everyone else saw: the courier, the mule, the man with two phones and a schedule and a growing bank balance and a shrinking soul.

He went inside. The hostel was quiet. Mama Siti was in the kitchen. Mei Ling was at reception.

Connor climbed the staircase. The third step squeaked. On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters said nothing. In Dorm 3, Bed 7 waited with its carved name and its thin mattress and its view of nothing but the air well's grey light.

He lay down. He pulled the blue towel over his chest. He closed his eyes.

Jake was gone. Priya would be gone in nine days. Tomoko was still watching. Felix was still smiling. And Connor was still here, in the building that had been many things, in the bed that had held many people, carrying things he'd never opened for reasons he'd never examined in a city that was simultaneously the most beautiful and the most dangerous place he'd ever been.

---

Priya found him in the common room at noon.

She was carrying her Lonely Planet -- the rubber-banded, dog-eared Bible of her travels -- and a cup of the hostel's instant coffee, which tasted like it had been manufactured from the concept of coffee rather than actual beans. She sat in the armchair opposite and set the guidebook on the coffee table, and the gesture had the weight of a woman placing a marker, establishing territory, preparing for something.

"Jake's gone," she said.

"Yeah."

"He asked you to go with him."

"He did."

"You should have gone."

Connor looked at her. She was wearing her white T-shirt and her round glasses and the jade bracelet he'd bought her, and her face was carrying the expression he'd come to think of as her clinical face -- the one that saw through surfaces, that diagnosed conditions the patient didn't know they had.

"I couldn't. The work--"

"The work." She said it the way you'd say the name of a disease you'd been tracking. "Connor, I have nine days left. Nine days before my flight. And in those nine days, I can either watch you keep doing what you're doing, or I can try one more time to make you see what you're doing. I'm choosing to try."

"Priya--"

"Don't. Don't 'Priya' me. Don't deflect. Don't charm. Just listen."

He listened. Not because he wanted to but because Priya's voice, when it reached this register -- the low, steady, unflinching register of a woman who had spent three years learning how to talk to people who were dying -- was a force he couldn't redirect.

"Jake leaving is the best thing that could happen to you, because Jake leaving proves it's possible. He walked out. He booked a flight for forty-seven ringgit and he walked out of this hostel and got in a car and left. Nobody stopped him. Felix didn't stop him. The network didn't stop him. He just left. Which means you can leave too."

"It's different. Jake wasn't--"

"Jake wasn't doing deliveries. I know. That's the point. Jake got out before he was in. You're in. But 'in' is not 'stuck.' You're not trapped, Connor. You're choosing. Every morning you wake up and choose to stay and choose to carry and choose not to look, and the choosing is the thing that's killing you."

The word *killing* sat between them. It was the first time Priya had used it without qualification, without softening, without the clinical distance that medical training provided. The word was raw and personal and it hit the air between them with the force of something thrown.

"I'm not dying," Connor said.

"You will be."

The sentence was delivered without emphasis, without drama, in the flat, informational tone of a doctor reading a test result. It entered the space between them and stayed there, occupying the air the way smoke occupies a room -- not filling it but changing its composition, making every breath after it different from every breath before. Connor's body received the sentence before his mind did: a contraction in his stomach, a coldness across his shoulders, the involuntary straightening of his spine that was the body's oldest response to threat, the primate reflex of a creature hearing a predator's step. He was sitting in an armchair in a common room in a hostel and his body was preparing to run. But there was nowhere to run to. The threat was not in the room. The threat was the room. The threat was the building and the city and the schedule and the man upstairs with the matte black phone and the precise German accent, and running from all of that would require a velocity Connor did not possess.

The silence after *you will be* lasted four seconds. Connor counted them -- not deliberately but with the automatic, metronomic awareness of a person for whom time has become material, each second a unit of weight added to the distance between the word and its consequence. Four seconds. Priya did not look away. She held his eyes with the steadiness of a woman who had said the worst thing she could say and would not retreat from it.

Priya looked at him and her eyes were wet behind her glasses and the wetness was not crying -- Priya did not cry, not about this, not yet -- but the pre-crying, the physiological response to a grief that had not yet fully formed because the thing it was grieving had not yet fully happened.

"I'm leaving in nine days," she said. "And when I leave, there will be nobody in this hostel who cares whether you live or die. Tomoko cares about the story. Mei Ling cares about liability. Razak cares about his arrangement. Felix cares about his schedule. Nobody will care about *you*."

The words were precise and they were cruel and they were accurate, and the accuracy was the cruelty, because what Priya was describing was not a possibility but a certainty -- the certainty that Connor Briggs, once stripped of the people who loved him, would be alone in a building full of strangers, carrying packages for a man who saw him as a tool, in a city that would process his death with the same bureaucratic efficiency it processed everything else.

"Come with me," she said. "To London. Or to Melbourne. Wherever. Just leave. Just get on a plane and leave this building and this city and this man, and we'll sort the rest out later. I'll buy your ticket. Right now. On my phone."

She had her phone in her hand. The screen was on. A flight booking app was open. The cursor blinked in the search field, waiting for a destination, waiting for a name, waiting for the word that would change everything.

Connor looked at the screen. He looked at Priya. He looked at the common room -- the ceiling fans, the red lanterns, the bookshelf, the TV, the coffee table where the printed law had sat for one night before being swept into the trash. He looked at the building that had become his home, the only home he'd had in four years, the home that was not a home but a trap designed to feel like one.

And he almost said yes. The word formed. It was there -- in his throat, behind his teeth, a single syllable that weighed nothing and would change everything. *Yes.* He could feel the future that lived inside the word: the booking confirmed, the e-ticket generated, the taxi to KLIA, the departure board showing Melbourne or London or anywhere, the plane climbing above the Titiwangsa Range and banking west and the city shrinking below him until it was a circuit board, until it was a smudge, until it was nothing, until the packages and the sports bags and the blue doors and the matte black phone were just coordinates on a map of a place he used to be. The cursor blinked in the search field of Priya's phone. The cursor was patient. The cursor would wait as long as it took. He could see, on the screen, the airline logos -- AirAsia, Malaysia Airlines, Malindo -- and the departure times arranged in rows, and the prices in ringgit, and each row was an exit, each price was the cost of freedom, and the cost was negligible, the cost was nothing, the cost was less than two deliveries to Mr. Tan on Jalan Ipoh.

He opened his mouth. The word was there.

"I can't," he said.

The word *can't* was a lie. The word was *won't*, and the difference between *can't* and *won't* was the difference between a man who was imprisoned and a man who had locked his own cell and thrown the key through the bars. The machine had intercepted the yes and replaced it with can't, the way it always did, the way it had intercepted the phone call to his father, the way it had intercepted the impulse to follow Jake to Langkawi, the way it intercepted every exit before Connor could reach it -- smoothly, silently, with the practised efficiency of a system that had learned to mistake its own survival for his.

Priya's thumb hovered over the screen. The flight app waited. The cursor blinked.

She closed the app. The screen went dark with a small, definitive sound -- the click of the lock button, the sound a door makes when it closes for the last time, the sound of an offer expiring. She put the phone face-down on the armrest, the gesture slow and deliberate, the way a doctor sets down a chart when the diagnosis is final. She picked up her Lonely Planet and held it against her chest, the rubber bands pressing into her arms, the guidebook a shield now rather than a map, something to hold against the body when the body needed holding. And she looked at Connor with the expression of a woman who has offered everything she has and watched it refused, and the expression was not anger and it was not contempt and it was not even sadness. It was something beyond those things -- the particular, terminal acceptance of a person who has done everything possible and knows that everything possible is not enough.

"Okay," she said.

She stood. She walked to the staircase. At the foot of the stairs, she stopped.

"I'll be here for nine more days," she said, without turning around. "If you change your mind. Any time. Any hour. I'll be here."

She climbed the stairs. She was gone.

Connor sat in the common room. The ceiling fans turned. The red lanterns glowed. The empty armchair where Priya had been sitting held the impression of her body -- a slight compression in the cushion, a warmth that faded as the minutes passed, the ghost of a presence that had tried to save him and could not.

He was alone. Not the hostel alone, the dorm-full-of-strangers alone that backpackers called solitude. Really alone. The alone of a man who has pushed away everyone who could help and clung to the one person who would destroy him. The alone that is the last stage before the falling, when the safety net has been removed and the ground is coming up and the only question is when, not if.

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.*

The burner phone buzzed. Felix.

*Tomorrow's schedule is confirmed. Jalan Ipoh, 10 AM. New item -- larger than usual. Be ready.*

Connor read the message. He typed back: *On it.*

He put the phone down. He stared at the ceiling. And somewhere on a highway heading north toward KLIA, in the back of a Grab, Jake Porter was telling his driver about a boat in Langkawi and a girl in Penang and a week that was going to be "absolutely epic, dude," and the driver was nodding with the patient courtesy of a man who was paid by the kilometre, and the car was moving, and Jake was leaving, and the leaving was the thing that saved him, though he would never know it, the way you never know the bullet that missed, the train you didn't catch, the bed in the hostel where the name was carved and the ceiling fan turned and the boy who stayed was the boy who died.
