# Chapter 14: The Law

The morning started with a delivery that almost didn't happen.

It was Day 21, a Tuesday, and the schedule said Brickfields -- Lorong 3, the "Blue Door," RM350. Connor collected the package from Felix's room at nine. Sports bag again, black nylon, zipped shut. The weight was the same as last time -- that particular density, that specific heft that he'd stopped thinking about and started accepting, the way you accept the weight of your own body.

The Grab took him south through the morning traffic, past the gleaming cylinder of KL Tower and the construction cranes that lined the sky like skeletal birds. The driver played Tamil radio, the music rich and complex, tablas and strings and a voice that climbed and descended in patterns Connor couldn't follow but found hypnotic.

The Blue Door was exactly that -- a metal door painted a blue that had faded to the colour of old jeans, set into the wall of a narrow lorong behind a row of shophouses in Brickfields. The lorong smelled of curry leaf and diesel and the warm, composting sweetness of overripe jackfruit from a tree that hung over someone's back wall. Connor knocked twice. The door opened. A woman this time -- middle-aged, Indian-Malaysian, wearing a salwar kameez in forest green, her expression carrying the professional neutrality of someone conducting a transaction. She took the bag. The door closed.

RM350.

He walked back through Brickfields. Little India -- the neighbourhood's unofficial name -- was in its midmorning rhythm. Garland shops were stringing jasmine and marigold into thick ropes for the temples. A banana leaf restaurant was opening its shutters, the staff laying down fresh leaves on metal trays with the reverent precision of altar preparation. Bollywood music leaked from a textile shop where mannequins wore saris in colours that existed nowhere in nature and everywhere in dreams.

Connor stopped at a tea stall. Teh tarik -- the pulled tea, milky and sweet, poured in a long golden arc from glass to glass. He drank it standing up at the counter, watching the garland maker across the street thread flowers with hands that moved like water, and he felt the warmth of the tea and the warmth of the money and the warmth of a Tuesday morning in a city he had come to know, and the warmth was good, and the warmth was the problem.

Because warmth was what made the carrying possible. Not the money -- the money was incentive, but incentive alone doesn't overcome the instinct for self-preservation. It was the warmth. The warmth of routine. The warmth of a city that had become home. The warmth of belonging to something -- a schedule, a network, a structure that gave his days shape and his wallet weight. The warmth made the packages invisible, made the drops ordinary, made the whole arrangement feel like life rather than the specific, engineered mechanism that would end it.

He finished his tea. He went home. He spent the afternoon at Grind Culture, posting for Pacific Soul, and in the evening he met Priya.

---

Priya had printed the law.

Not summarised it, not paraphrased it, not read about it in a guidebook and referenced it in conversation. She had found an internet café on Jalan Tun H.S. Lee -- one of the last surviving specimens, a narrow room of ancient Dells and rattling keyboards that charged RM3 per hour and smelled of instant coffee and the stale urgency of travelers who needed to print boarding passes -- and she had sat at terminal number four and searched the Malaysian legal database and found the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, Section 39B, and printed it.

Five pages. Single-spaced. The paper was cheap, the ink slightly smudged, the margins too narrow because the internet café's printer was calibrated for A4 and these were A4 pages but the margins had been set by someone who didn't understand margins. The header read: LAWS OF MALAYSIA -- ACT 234 -- DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT 1952. The text beneath was small and dense and written in the particular English of Commonwealth legislation -- formal, archaic, devastating in its precision.

She had highlighted the relevant sections in yellow. The yellow marker -- borrowed from the hostel's communal stationery drawer, which contained three pens (one working), a roll of tape, and a selection of markers abandoned by travelers who had used them to write their names on food in the communal fridge -- bled slightly into the cheap paper, creating halos around the words it was meant to emphasise.

The highlighted passages said this:

*Section 39B(1): Any person who, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not such other person is in Malaysia --*

*(a) traffics in a dangerous drug;*

*(b) offers to traffic in a dangerous drug; or*

*(c) does or offers to do an act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a dangerous drug,*

*shall be guilty of an offence against this Act and shall be punished on conviction with death.*

And this:

*Section 37(da): Any person who is found to have in his custody or under his control --*

*(i) anything which contains more than 5 grammes of heroin or morphine;*

*(ii) anything which contains more than 15 grammes of cannabis;*

*(iii) anything which contains more than 50 grammes of methamphetamine...*

*shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be trafficking in the said dangerous drug.*

Priya had read these passages six times. She had sat at terminal four in the internet café with the screen casting blue light on her glasses and the ceiling fan overhead turning with the same lazy inevitability as the one in the hostel, and she had read the law six times because the first five times she kept hoping the words would rearrange themselves into something less absolute.

They didn't. The law was the law. The law said *death*. The law said *presumed*. The law said fifty grams of methamphetamine and you were presumed to be trafficking and the sentence was mandatory and the sentence was death and the judge had no discretion and the defendant had no exemption and nationality was irrelevant and ignorance was irrelevant and the gap between carrying a package and dying for carrying a package was measured in grams.

She had paid RM6 for the printing and walked back to the hostel through the afternoon heat with the five pages folded in her Lonely Planet, between the chapter on Kuala Lumpur and the chapter on Penang, and she had waited.

She waited through the afternoon. She waited through dinner -- she and Connor eating roti canai at the mamak stall on the corner, the conversation careful and warm, two people navigating around the topic they both knew was coming. She waited through the evening, through the common room hours when the hostel's social life assembled and dispersed, through Jake's announcement that he was going to Changkat ("Again? You were just there." "Dude, it's Changkat. It's always just there."), through Tomoko's silent transit from the staircase to the rooftop with her camera.

She waited until the common room was nearly empty -- just her and Connor and the TV playing a nature documentary in which a komodo dragon was pursuing something that didn't want to be caught. Then she set her Lonely Planet on the coffee table, opened it to the marked page, and removed the five printed sheets.

"I need to show you something."

Connor was on the sofa, phone in hand, scrolling with the absent focus of a man using his thumb to avoid his thoughts. He looked up.

"What's that?"

"The law." She placed the pages on the coffee table, the yellow highlights facing up, the words DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT visible even from his angle. "Malaysian drug law. I printed it."

The reaction was immediate and involuntary. Connor's body shifted -- a small, physical withdrawal, the torso leaning back an inch, the shoulders pulling together, the instinctive recoil of an animal presented with something it recognised as dangerous before the brain had time to intervene.

"Priya--"

"Just read it. Please. Just read this one section."

She pointed to the highlighted passage: Section 39B(1). The word *death* in yellow.

Connor didn't look at the page. He looked at Priya. She was sitting on the edge of the armchair, her back straight, her hands flat on her thighs. She was wearing her glasses and a white T-shirt and her hair was in its usual braid and she looked, in the amber light of the common room, like a doctor about to deliver a diagnosis that the patient had not asked for and would not accept.

"We've been over this--"

"No, we haven't. We've talked around it. You've told me it's phone accessories. I've told you I'm worried. We've had the same non-conversation three times and nothing changes. This is different. This is the actual law. Read it."

Her voice was steady but there was a pressure behind it -- the pressure of a woman who had been holding something back for two weeks and had decided, tonight, in this room, that holding it back was no longer a kindness. The pressure was love. Connor would not recognise this until much later, in a room where recognising it could no longer help him.

He looked at the page.

The words were small and dense and they sat on the cheap paper with the calm, immovable weight of something that had been true for seventy years. *Shall be guilty of an offence against this Act and shall be punished on conviction with death.* The yellow highlighting made the word *death* brighter, louder, more present. It was not a metaphorical death, not a figurative death, not the death that people meant when they said "I'd die for a coffee." It was the death of the body, permanent, administered by the state, in a building forty kilometres south of where Connor was sitting.

He read the sentence. His eyes moved across the words. The words entered his brain. Then the machine started running.

"Okay," he said. "So Malaysia has harsh drug laws. I know that. Everyone knows that. What's your point?"

"My point is--" Priya leaned forward. Her glasses caught the lamp's light and for a moment her eyes were invisible behind twin circles of reflection. "Connor, do you know what fifty grams looks like? It's this much." She held up her hand, cupped, the fingers forming a hollow the size of a tennis ball. "That's it. That's the threshold. If you're caught carrying that much methamphetamine, you're automatically presumed to be a trafficker. The prosecution doesn't have to prove intent. The burden shifts to you. You have to prove you *weren't* trafficking."

"I'm not carrying methamphetamine."

"How do you know?"

The question was a scalpel. It cut through the layers -- through the confidence, through the certainty, through the phone-accessories story and the logistics explanation and the Felix-is-a-photographer narrative -- and it touched something underneath. Something that flinched.

"Because Felix told me--"

"Felix told you it was phone components. Felix told you it was import-export. Felix told you it was logistics. Felix told you a lot of things. Has Felix ever *shown* you what's in the packages?"

"He can't. The clients--"

"Have you ever opened one?"

"No--"

"Have you ever weighed one?"

"What? No--"

"Have you ever noticed that the packages are heavier than phone accessories should be? That the drop-offs are always in back rooms, through side entrances, with people who don't make eye contact? That Felix gave you a burner phone -- a prepaid, anonymous phone that can't be traced? That the money he pays you is always cash transfer, never documented, never receipted?"

Each question landed like a step on a staircase, each one lower than the last, each one taking them further from the surface and closer to something dark and solid. Priya's voice did not rise. It remained clinical, measured, the voice of a woman who had been trained to deliver terrible news in controlled doses. But her hands were shaking. Not visibly -- the tremor was small, internal, the kind you felt rather than saw. Connor didn't see it.

"You sound like a conspiracy theory," he said. The words came out sharp, defensive, the verbal equivalent of the physical recoil from earlier -- the body protecting itself from information that threatened the architecture of the self. "Felix is a photographer. He does consulting work. The packages are phone components. I've done fifteen deliveries and nothing has happened."

"Nothing has happened *yet*."

"Right. And nothing's going to happen. Because it's legit. Because I know what I'm doing."

Priya reached across the coffee table and picked up the printed pages. She held them in front of Connor -- not aggressively, not theatrically, but with the quiet insistence of someone holding up an X-ray of a fracture the patient insists doesn't exist.

"Section 39B. Trafficking in dangerous drugs. Punished on conviction with death. Mandatory. The judge has no choice. There is no plea bargain. There is no first-offender exception. There is no exemption for foreigners." She paused. "Connor, if what Felix is giving you contains methamphetamine -- even if you didn't know -- the law doesn't care. The law says you're a trafficker. The law says you die."

The common room was quiet. The TV documentary had moved on -- the komodo dragon had caught its prey and was consuming it with the patient efficiency of a predator that had all the time in the world. The ceiling fan turned. The red lanterns cast their warm, permanent glow, and in that glow, in the amber light that made everything soft and safe and hostel-warm, the word *die* sat between two people who looked at each other across a coffee table and saw different things.

Priya saw a man she cared about walking into traffic.

Connor saw a woman who didn't understand.

"Priya." His voice softened. The sharpness dropped away, replaced by something warmer but no less defensive -- the gentle condescension of a man explaining to a woman that her fears are unfounded. "I appreciate this. I really do. I know you care about me and I know you're worried. But you're making assumptions based on -- what? A guidebook? A law you printed from the internet? You don't know Felix. You don't know the business. You're extrapolating from fear."

"I'm extrapolating from evidence."

"What evidence? That the packages are heavy? That Felix has money? That's not evidence. That's suspicion."

"I met a photojournalist who's been covering drug trafficking in Southeast Asia for three years. A woman from Japan who photographs things for a living. She says--"

"Tomoko." Connor's voice hardened again. "You've been talking to Tomoko about me?"

"She came to me. She's concerned--"

"She's paranoid. She's a stranger who decided she doesn't like Felix and now she's spreading--"

"She's not a stranger. She's a journalist. She recognises patterns."

"Patterns." Connor laughed. The laugh was thin, humourless, the acoustic signature of a man who is running out of defences and has resorted to the one that requires no argument: ridicule. "Patterns. So now Tomoko's a pattern expert and Felix is a drug dealer and I'm a -- what? A drug mule? Is that what you think?"

The word *mule* entered the room and the room changed. Not physically -- the fans still turned, the lanterns still glowed -- but the word carried a charge that altered the air, the way static electricity alters the feeling of a room before a storm. Connor had said it. He'd said it sarcastically, dismissively, weaponising the word to make it ridiculous. But the word was not ridiculous. The word was the exact, precise, correct term for what he was. A drug mule. A person who carries drugs for someone else, unknowingly or unwillingly. The word was the truth, and he'd spoken it himself, and now it was in the room, and it could not be un-spoken.

Priya didn't flinch. "I think," she said, with the careful precision of a surgeon making an incision, "that you are carrying things you have not looked at, for a man you do not know, in a country that will kill you for it. And I think you know this. And I think the reason you won't open one of those packages is because you're afraid of what you'll find."

The sentence was the most dangerous thing anyone had said to Connor since he'd arrived in KL. Not because it was unkind -- it was the kindest thing anyone had said to him in months, possibly years -- but because it was true. And the truth, in Connor's architecture of self-deception, was the one structural element that could bring the whole building down.

He stood up. The movement was sudden, physical, the body's response to a fight-or-flight signal that the brain had been too slow to intercept. He was standing before he knew he was standing, and the standing was a decision, the decision to be above this conversation, to be on his feet while Priya was seated, to occupy more space, to assert the physical dominance that men resort to when intellectual dominance has failed.

"You know what your problem is?" he said. "You plan everything. You research everything. You print out laws and highlight them in yellow and you think that preparation is the same as understanding. But you've been here three weeks, the same as me, and you haven't lived. You've studied. You've read guidebooks and printed laws and talked to journalists and worried about things that aren't happening. And meanwhile, I've been out there. Living. Experiencing. Actually doing the thing you're too afraid to do."

He heard himself speaking and felt the familiar momentum of a rant that has escaped the control of its speaker -- the sentences building on each other, each one louder and more wrong than the last, the rhetorical engine running on anger and fear and the desperate fuel of a man who knows, somewhere beneath the noise, that the person he's yelling at is right.

Priya sat in the armchair and watched him. She did not speak. She did not flinch. She did not cry. She held the printed pages on her lap and she looked at Connor with the expression of a woman who had just watched a patient refuse treatment, and the expression was not anger and it was not contempt. It was something worse. It was the particular sorrow of someone who understands that love, by itself, cannot save a person from themselves.

"Are you finished?" she said.

He was. The rant had spent itself. The room was quiet. The komodo dragon documentary had ended, replaced by a cooking show in Mandarin.

"I'm going to bed," Connor said.

"Connor."

He stopped at the foot of the staircase. She was standing now, the printed pages in one hand, her Lonely Planet in the other, her posture straight, her face illuminated by the red lanterns in a way that made her look both ancient and young, a woman from a painting, a woman who had seen something the painter couldn't capture.

"I'm leaving this on the coffee table," she said. She placed the five pages on the table, fanning them slightly so the highlighted sections were visible. "In case you want to read them. In case you decide that knowing the truth is worth more than not knowing it."

She walked past him. Her shoulder brushed his arm. The jade bracelet -- the one he'd bought her at the night market with money from the first envelope delivery -- slid on her wrist and caught the lantern light, green and vivid and paid for with something that was not clean.

She climbed the staircase. She was gone.

Connor stood alone in the common room. The cooking show played. On the coffee table, the five printed pages sat in the amber light, the yellow highlights glowing like small fires, the word *death* visible from where he stood, the word *mandatory* visible, the word *trafficking* visible, the whole ugly architecture of the law laid out in black ink on cheap paper, waiting to be read.

He could read them. Right now. He could sit on the sofa and read five pages and know, with legal precision, exactly what would happen to him if the packages contained what Priya believed they contained. Five pages. Ten minutes. The difference between ignorance and knowledge, between the comfort of not-knowing and the terror of knowing, between the man he was and the man he'd have to become.

He looked at the pages.

He looked at the staircase.

He went upstairs.

---

On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters under the paint said nothing to him. They'd been saying nothing to him for three weeks, and they would continue to say nothing until the building was demolished or the paint was stripped or someone who could read wartime Japanese happened to pause on the landing and translate: *Processing Room 3 -- Detainees Report Here.* The building had always been a place where people were processed. The system had changed. The processing hadn't.

He passed the door to Dorm 4 -- Priya's dorm. A line of light showed under the door. She was awake. She was in there, awake, with her Lonely Planet and her knowledge and her fear for him, and the light under the door was like a hand extended, and he walked past it.

At the top of the staircase to the third floor, he almost collided with Tomoko.

She was coming down. Camera in hand -- the professional Nikon she carried everywhere, the lens cap off, as though she'd been shooting something on the third floor. In the dim hallway light, her face was unreadable, the dyed red tips of her hair dark as wine.

They looked at each other. The hallway was narrow. Neither moved.

"She told you," Connor said. Not a question.

Tomoko tilted her head. The gesture was economical, precise. "She told me she was going to talk to you. I told her what I've seen."

"And what have you seen, Tomoko? What exactly have you seen that makes you such an expert on my life?"

"I've seen Felix," she said. "I've been watching him since my first week. I've seen the packages arrive at the hostel at night. I've seen the people who bring them -- different people, always at night, always through the back entrance from the alley. I've seen Wei's shop and what happens there after midnight. And I've seen you, Connor. Every morning, going out with a bag. Coming back without one."

She spoke without emotion, without judgment, reciting observations the way a journalist recites facts -- assembled, verified, presented for the record. She was not trying to convince him. She was not trying to save him. She was documenting.

"I've taken photographs," she said. "Of the people who come at night. Of the packages. Of Felix and Wei together in the shop. I have a record."

"Great. You have a record. What are you going to do with it, Tomoko? Send it to the papers? Call the police?"

"I haven't decided."

The sentence was flat. It contained no threat and no promise. It was the sentence of a woman who had seen enough of the world to know that decisions made in hallways at midnight were rarely the right ones.

"But I want you to know," she said, "that the record exists. And that if something happens -- to you, to anyone at this hostel -- I will use it."

Connor stared at her. In the dim light, with the camera in her hand and the quiet certainty in her voice, she looked like something from a different genre -- not the dark comedy of backpacker culture but something more serious, more consequential, a woman standing at the intersection of witness and intervention and choosing, for now, to remain on the side of the former.

"Nothing is going to happen," Connor said.

Tomoko stepped past him on the narrow staircase. Her shoulder didn't touch his. The space between them was precisely maintained.

"*Ki wo tsukete*," she said. The Japanese was soft, almost inaudible. She didn't translate. She descended the staircase -- the third step didn't squeak for her -- and was gone.

Connor stood on the landing. He didn't know the phrase. He wouldn't look it up. It meant *be careful*, which was the same thing everyone had been telling him, in English and Malay and now Japanese, the same message in every language, the same warning he had been receiving and refusing since the day he arrived, the same two words that bridged every culture and every tongue and every human who had ever watched another human walk toward a cliff and tried, with nothing but words, to make them stop.

---

In Bed 7, in the dark, with the blue towel on his chest and the two phones beside him and the ceiling fan turning its endless, indifferent rotation, Connor did not sleep.

He lay on his back and stared at the underside of the bunk and thought about nothing, which was harder than thinking about something because nothing was not empty -- nothing was full of the things he was not thinking about, the pages on the coffee table and Priya's voice and the word *mule* and the word *death* and the weight of a sports bag and the face of a man named David at a bar on Changkat who had a brother in Kajang Prison.

At three AM, he got up. He crept out of the dorm, down the staircase -- the third step squeaked, louder in the empty building -- and into the common room.

The pages were still on the coffee table.

He stood over them. The common room was dark now, the lanterns off, the only light from the street lamps filtering through the front window. The pages were grey rectangles on the dark wood. He could see the yellow highlights, dimly, like reflections of something from a distance.

He reached out. His hand hovered above the pages. His fingers were close enough to feel the paper's texture -- cheap, slightly warm from the room, the surface rough.

He picked them up.

He held them in the dark. The weight was nothing -- five sheets of paper, an insignificant mass, the lightest thing he'd carried in weeks. But the weight was also everything, because the weight was knowledge, and knowledge was the thing he'd been running from since the first envelope, since the first RM200, since the first time Felix said *don't open it* and Connor obeyed.

He stood in the dark common room, in the hostel that had been a warehouse and an interrogation centre and a gambling den and a brothel, in the building that remembered every use and every user, and he held the law in his hands.

He put the pages back on the table.

He went upstairs.

In the morning, the pages would be gone. Aisha, the part-time cleaner, would collect them during her six AM sweep of the common room, mistaking them for rubbish, which in a certain sense they were -- rubbish to a man who would not read them, wasted paper, wasted ink, wasted yellow highlighter, wasted love. She would crumple them into the bin bag and they would join the compressed mass of hostel detritus -- empty bottles, food wrappers, boarding passes, the discarded evidence of lives in transit -- and the bin bag would be collected by the municipal truck at seven and carried to the Taman Beringin landfill, where the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, Section 39B, would decompose in the tropical heat alongside everything else the city no longer needed.

And Connor would go downstairs, and the table would be empty, and he would feel a brief, complex relief -- the relief of a man who has been offered salvation and declined it, and now the offer has expired, and the declining is permanent, and the permanence is a kind of freedom, the terrible freedom of a man who has chosen not to know.

He would eat Mama Siti's nasi lemak. He would check the burner phone. He would collect a package from Felix's room and carry it to Chow Kit, to Jalan Raja Bot 12, to a woman called Auntie Lim who would take the package through a beaded curtain and return with a nod, and the nod would be worth RM350, and the RM350 would join the growing balance in his account, the balance that now exceeded what his parents deposited monthly, the balance that was the proof of a life working, a life that worked, a life that was working right up until it didn't.

He would not speak to Priya. She would be at the Islamic Arts Museum, alone, sitting in the gallery of Quran manuscripts where the calligraphy was so beautiful it made her eyes water, not because of the art but because the precision of it -- the care, the intention, the refusal to be careless with something that mattered -- was the exact opposite of everything she'd witnessed in the common room the night before. She would sit with the manuscripts and think about Connor and think about the law and think about the word *death* in yellow highlight on cheap paper, and she would not cry because Priya Sharma did not cry about things she could still fight, and she had not stopped fighting, not yet, though the man she was fighting for had done everything possible to make her.

And Connor would make his delivery and collect his money and come home to the hostel and the warmth would close around him like water around a stone, and the stone would sink, and the water would smooth, and by evening the argument would be something that had happened, past tense, archived, filed in the cabinet of things-that-didn't-matter alongside every other warning he'd received and refused.

The machine would run. The machine would always run. The machine was Connor's greatest invention and his most reliable companion, more faithful than any friend, more constant than any love, working every moment of every day to produce the one product Connor could not live without: the absolute, unshakeable conviction that everything was fine.

Everything was fine.

The building breathed.

Somewhere, forty kilometres south, in Kajang Prison, a man named Steve stared at his ceiling and counted the days left on a mandatory sentence, and the number was a number that got smaller every morning, and the morning was coming, and the morning always came.
