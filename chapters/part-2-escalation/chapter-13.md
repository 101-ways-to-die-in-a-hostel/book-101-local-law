# Chapter 13: The Other Traveler

The man's name was David, and he had a story Connor didn't want to hear.

It was a Thursday night, Day 19, and the bar on Changkat Bukit Bintang was called The Whiskey Kitchen, which was a lie twice over because it served mainly beer and contained no kitchen. What it did contain was a long zinc bar, twenty barstools, a sound system playing nineties hip-hop at a volume that made conversation a competitive sport, and the particular strain of artificial energy that bars in tourist districts generate after ten PM -- the sense that something was happening, or about to happen, or had already happened and you'd missed it.

Connor was three beers in and feeling that internal warmth, different from the air's warmth -- more generous, the kind that made the world's edges soften and your own significance expand. He was perched on a barstool between Jake and a German couple he'd been talking to for twenty minutes without remembering either of their names.

Felix was not here. Felix was rarely at the bars anymore. Since the schedule had started, Felix had become more present and less visible -- texting daily, providing packages, transferring money, but spending his evenings in his private room or out of the hostel entirely, returning late, his movements untracked and unremarked upon. Connor had noticed this without noticing it, the way you notice a change in weather without looking at the sky.

Jake was telling the German couple about the fake Rolex. This was the third time Connor had heard the story, and it had evolved: the price had increased from eighty to a hundred and fifty ringgit, the vendor had become increasingly aggressive, and Jake's negotiation failure had been reframed as a deliberate act of magnanimity. "I let the guy have it," Jake was saying, his backward cap tilted at the angle of maximum sincerity. "It's, like, their economy, dude. Trickle-down tourism."

Connor laughed. The laugh was genuine. Jake's gift was the opposite of Connor's: where Connor curated stories for maximum impression, Jake told them with zero awareness of how they landed, which gave them an accidental honesty that was funnier than any calculated joke.

It was at the tail end of the Rolex story that David arrived.

He appeared on the barstool beside Connor the way people appeared on barstools in places like this -- without preamble, without introduction, materialising from the crowd like a chemical precipitate. He ordered a Tiger, drank a third of it in one motion, and set the bottle down with the deliberate care of a man who was pacing himself for a long night.

David was approximately forty. Australian -- Connor could tell before he spoke, by the tan, the deep crow's feet, the particular brand of stubble that Australians cultivated the way the French cultivated scarves. He wore a faded grey T-shirt, cargo shorts, and the expression of someone who had been somewhere recently that he hadn't come back from entirely.

"G'day," Connor said, because one Australian greeting another in a foreign bar was a gravitational inevitability. "Where you from?"

"Perth. You?"

"Melbourne."

"Right. Hawthorn?"

Connor blinked. "How'd you know?"

"Wild guess. You look like Hawthorn." He said *Hawthorn* the way Perth people said anything about Melbourne's eastern suburbs -- with a precision that managed to be simultaneously accurate and insulting.

"I'll take that as a compliment."

"You probably would."

David drank. Connor drank. The nineties hip-hop transitioned to nineties R&B, and two British girls at the end of the bar began singing along to TLC's "No Scrubs" with the passionate inaccuracy of people who'd learned the words phonetically.

"How long you been in KL?" David asked.

"Three weeks, give or take. Loving it. Best city in Southeast Asia, reckon."

"It's a good city." David's voice was level, careful, the voice of a man calibrating how much to say. "I've been here before. Few times. Back when I was younger. Traveling."

"Yeah? Backpacking?"

"Something like that." He drank. "I'm here for something different this time. Visiting someone."

"Oh yeah? Mate of yours?"

David looked at Connor. The look lasted two seconds. In those two seconds, Connor saw something in David's eyes that he would later describe to himself as tiredness but which was actually something deeper -- a bone-deep weariness, the kind that comes from carrying a story too long and telling it too many times.

"My brother," David said. "He's in Kajang Prison."

The words arrived at the bar and sat between them. Connor's hand paused, the beer bottle halfway to his mouth. Kajang Prison. He didn't know what Kajang Prison was, but the word *prison* was clear enough to change the temperature.

"Shit," Connor said. "What happened?"

David turned his bottle on the bar, rotating it slowly between his palms. The label -- Tiger Beer, orange and gold -- moved in a circle, the tiger's face appearing and disappearing.

"My brother Steve. Thirty-two when it happened. He was backpacking. Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia. You know the route."

Connor knew the route. He'd done the route. He was doing the route.

"He was in KL. Staying in a hostel in Chinatown. Not yours -- a different one, closer to the river. He'd been here about a month. Made friends. Met some people."

David paused. The "No Scrubs" performance had reached its crescendo. Jake was clapping.

"He met a guy. An older guy, European. Charming. Had money, had connections, knew everyone. My brother liked him. Trusted him. Started doing favors for him -- carrying things around the city. Packages, envelopes. My brother thought it was legit. Import-export, the guy told him. Electronics."

Connor's beer was still halfway to his mouth. He lowered it. The warmth of three beers was receding, replaced by something cooler, something that moved through his chest like a cold draught through an open door.

"He carried packages for this guy for about six weeks," David said. "The money was good. Really good. Better than anything my brother had earned in his life. He stopped questioning it. Stopped thinking about it. Just carried the bags, collected the money, lived the life."

The bar noise was there -- the music, the voices, the clinking -- but Connor heard it from a distance now, as though someone had turned the volume down on everything except David's voice, which was close and clear and moving through the space between them with the weight of something that had been said many times and never got lighter.

"Then he got arrested. Highway checkpoint. North-South Expressway, heading to Penang." David pronounced *Penang* the Australian way, flat and final. "Police pulled the bus over. Drug dog went straight to his bag. Suitcase, actually -- the guy had asked him to take a suitcase this time, said it was a bigger order. My brother didn't check what was inside. He'd never checked."

Connor set his beer on the bar. The condensation ran down the bottle and pooled on the zinc, a small circle of water that he watched as though it contained something worth seeing.

"Methamphetamine. In the lining of the suitcase. Three hundred grams." David said the number the way you'd say a temperature reading at a hospital -- factual, clinical, already knowing what it meant. "Fifty grams triggers the mandatory death penalty in Malaysia. He had six times that."

The bar pulsed. The R&B played. The British girls had moved on to Destiny's Child. Jake was trying to teach the German couple how to do a keg stand with a barstool, which was physically impossible but entertainingly attempted.

"That was five years ago," David said. "He's been in Kajang since. The death sentence was handed down in 2022. It's been through three appeals. All failed. He's on death row."

The words *death row* landed on the bar like stones dropped from a height. Connor heard them hit. He felt the impact in his stomach, in his hands, in the suddenly cold surface of the beer bottle he was holding.

"The guy who recruited him -- the European, the charmer -- was gone before the police even opened the suitcase. Just vanished. Nobody at the hostel knew his real name. He'd paid cash, given a fake passport at check-in. The CCTV at the hostel had been 'malfunctioning' for the whole period. My brother was the only person arrested. The only name on the evidence. The only face on the camera at the bus station."

David finished his beer. Set the empty bottle on the bar with a care that was almost reverent, the way you set down something fragile.

"He was the mule," David said. "That's what they call it. The person who carries the drugs doesn't know what they're carrying, or doesn't want to know. They're expendable. If they get caught, the network cuts them loose. No connection. No evidence. Just some backpacker with a suitcase full of meth and a story about import-export that no court in the world would believe."

Connor was aware that he should speak. The social mechanics of the situation demanded a response -- sympathy, outrage, something. But the machine in his head was running at full speed, processing David's story not as a story but as a pattern, a template, a description of events that bore a resemblance to other events that Connor did not want to compare them to.

*It's different,* the machine said. *David's brother's situation is completely different. Felix is a photographer. The packages are phone components. I've done the deliveries and nothing has happened. Nothing has happened.*

"That's..." Connor started. The sentence wanted to be *that's exactly what's happening to me* but the machine intercepted it and rerouted and what came out was: "That's awful, mate. I'm really sorry."

"Thanks." David nodded. The nod was small, practiced, the nod of a man who had received condolences so many times they'd become a ritual rather than a comfort. "I visit him every year. Four times now. The prison is... it's not what you'd imagine. It's worse. The heat, the overcrowding. Steve's in a cell with eight other men. He gets one hour of exercise a day. He's lost twenty kilograms."

"Is there anything -- can he get out? Can the government do something?"

"The Australian government has made representations. Diplomatic channels. Legal aid. But the Malaysian courts are independent, and the law is the law. Mandatory sentencing means mandatory. The judge couldn't have given him less even if he'd wanted to."

David ordered another beer. The barman -- a young Malay guy with a nose ring and a Metallica T-shirt -- popped the cap and set it down without making eye contact. The economy of bar service in places where stories like this were not uncommon.

"The hardest part," David said, "isn't the sentence. I mean, it is -- it's a death sentence, it's the hardest thing there is. But the hardest part is knowing he didn't have to be there. He could have said no. He could have opened one of the packages. He could have Googled 'Malaysian drug laws' and found out in thirty seconds what the penalties were. The information was there. It was everywhere. Signs at the airport. Travel advisories. Guidebook warnings. He just... didn't look."

The word *didn't look* moved through Connor's mind like something alive.

"He trusted the wrong person," David said. "That's it. That's the whole story. He trusted a man who was designed to be trusted, who made trusting him feel natural, who made not trusting him feel like paranoia. And the man was designed that way because design is what predators do. They design the approach, and they design the friendship, and they design the dependency, and by the time you realise you're in a trap, the trap is the only structure you have."

Connor drank. The beer was warm. The bar was loud. Somewhere behind them, Jake had successfully performed a modified keg stand that involved balancing on one hand while a German woman poured beer into his mouth, and the resulting applause was genuine and surprised.

"Can I ask you something?" Connor said.

"Sure."

"Did your brother ever... I mean, did he suspect? Before he got caught. Did he ever think something was off?"

David looked at him. The look was longer this time -- three seconds, four -- and in it, Connor saw something that might have been recognition. The recognition of one Australian looking at another and seeing the same species of confidence, the same architecture of denial, the same belief that the rules of the universe contained a clause excusing people who looked like them from consequences that applied to everyone else.

"He says he didn't," David said. "He says he never suspected. But I know my brother. He's not stupid. He's... trusting. Optimistic. The kind of bloke who assumes people are good because he's good. And he was broke and the money was easy and the alternative was going home and getting a job and admitting the whole travel thing was just running away."

The sentence hit Connor in the chest. It didn't hit the wall. It went through the wall and into the space behind, the space where the things he didn't examine lived.

"I think he knew," David said. "Not consciously. Not in a way he could articulate. But somewhere in there, he knew. He just chose not to look. Because looking would have meant stopping, and stopping would have meant facing everything the travel and the money and the friendship were helping him avoid."

The music changed. Someone had commandeered the bar's Bluetooth and "Bohemian Rhapsody" erupted at maximum volume, the opening piano notes cutting through the conversation like something from a different world. The bar surged with the energy of collective recognition -- drunk tourists singing along, hands in the air, the song functioning as it always did in bars: as a temporary religion.

Connor stood up. Not because the conversation was over but because his body was making a decision his mind hadn't caught up with. The barstool scraped on the floor. He reached for his wallet, pulled out a fifty-ringgit note, and placed it on the bar.

"This one's on me," he said.

"You don't have to--"

"I know. I want to." He paused. The sentence wanted more. It wanted *because your brother is in prison for doing what I'm doing and the least I can do is buy you a beer.* But the machine ran, and the sentence that came out was: "Take care of yourself, mate. And your brother. I hope it works out."

David nodded. "Thanks." He paused, then: "How long are you staying in KL?"

"Haven't decided."

"Can I give you some advice? Unsolicited?"

"Sure."

"Be careful who you trust. That's all. In this city, in this part of the world. Be careful who you call a friend, and be careful what you carry, and if someone offers you easy money, ask yourself why the money is easy. Because the money is never easy. The ease is the product. The ease is what they're selling you."

Connor heard the words. Every one of them. They entered his ears and moved through the auditory cortex and arrived in the part of his brain where meaning was assembled, and the meaning was clear. It was the clearest warning he had received -- clearer than Priya's concern, clearer than Tomoko's suspicion, clearer than Mei Ling's instruction, clearer than Mama Siti's proverb. It was the testimony of a man whose brother was on death row for doing the exact thing Connor was doing, delivered without ambiguity, without metaphor, without the comfortable distance of hypothetical.

Connor heard it. He understood it. And then he did what he always did with information that threatened the structure of his self-deception.

He changed the channel.

"Will do, mate. Cheers."

He clapped David on the shoulder -- the Australian gesture of solidarity, which functions simultaneously as a greeting, a farewell, and a way to end a conversation you can no longer sustain. David's shoulder was thin under the faded T-shirt. The man felt smaller than he looked, as though the story had been holding him up and now that he'd told it, the support had gone.

Connor walked back to Jake and the Germans. He ordered a shot of something amber. He drank it. He ordered another. The bar noise reassembled around him -- the music, the laughter, Jake's voice rising above it all with the indestructible buoyancy of a man who had never been troubled by a thought he couldn't resolve with another beer.

"Dude, who was that?" Jake asked.

"Just some bloke. His brother's in prison here."

"No way. What for?"

"Drugs."

"Shit. That's heavy."

"Yeah."

Jake processed this for approximately four seconds -- the amount of time Jake allocated to heavy topics before returning to baseline. "Want to do shots? The German girl's buying."

"Yeah. Shots."

They did shots. They did more shots. The bar swelled and contracted with the rhythm of the night, the crowd thickening past midnight and thinning after one. Connor drank with the specific, deliberate purpose of a man trying to flood an engine -- pouring alcohol into the machine until the rationalizations blurred and the fear numbed and the only thing left was the warm, idiot comfort of being too drunk to think.

It worked. Alcohol was reliable that way.

---

---

The hours between midnight and two AM blurred the way they always blurred on Changkat -- alcohol and bass and the friction of bodies in a space too small to hold them.

Connor moved from the bar to the dance floor to the smoking area, cycling through the stations of a night out with the practiced efficiency of a man who had done this in thirty cities. At every station, David's story followed him. It didn't sit on the surface of his thoughts -- he'd pushed it below, buried it under shots and music and the deliberate energy of a man trying to outrun something that wasn't chasing him. But it was there, the way a stone is there at the bottom of a river: invisible, immovable, changing the current.

In the smoking area -- a concrete courtyard strung with fairy lights and populated by the international fellowship of people who had quit smoking in their home countries but not abroad -- he stood next to a group of Malaysians. Young, well-dressed, speaking a rapid mix of English and Malay that Connor had learned to identify as "Manglish" -- the colloquial hybrid that sounded like two languages having an argument they were both enjoying.

One of them, a woman in her twenties with dyed blue hair and a T-shirt that said NASI LEMAK IS MY LOVE LANGUAGE, noticed Connor listening and switched to English.

"You're Australian, right? I can tell from the tan lines."

"Is it that obvious?"

"Very." She grinned. "First time in KL?"

"Been here three weeks."

"Three weeks! You like it?"

"Love it. Best food in the world."

This was the correct answer. The woman's grin widened and she launched into a five-minute lecture on where to find the best nasi kandar (a stall in Bangsar that had no name, you just had to know), the best cendol (a cart near Masjid India that only appeared on Tuesdays), and the best char kway teow (her grandmother's kitchen, but second-best was a hawker in Kepong who used so much lard his cholesterol was a medical concern).

Connor listened. He laughed. He took notes in his phone -- the real phone, the Instagram phone, the phone that existed in the world of food recommendations and normal conversations and people who didn't have brothers on death row.

"Be careful though," the woman said, as the conversation wound down and her friends beckoned from inside. "KL is safe, but it's not -- how do you say -- it's not without teeth. Don't walk alone in Chow Kit after midnight. Don't flash your phone on the LRT. And for the love of God, don't get involved with anything illegal. This country does not play."

She said it lightly, the way locals said it -- a casual caveat, a speed bump in an otherwise smooth conversation. But the word *illegal* caught on something in Connor's chest and held there, a fishhook in soft tissue.

"Wouldn't dream of it," he said.

"Good boy." She patted his arm with the maternal authority of a woman eight years his junior. "Enjoy your stay. Eat the cendol on Tuesday."

She disappeared inside. The fairy lights swayed. Connor stood in the smoking area and didn't smoke and felt the fishhook pull.

---

They walked home at two AM, Connor and Jake, weaving through the Changkat aftermath -- the street littered with cigarette butts and promotional flyers and the occasional shoe, the bars disgorging their final patrons into the humid dark, taxis lined up at the intersection like yellow insects drawn to the remaining light.

Jake was monologuing about a girl he'd talked to at the bar -- Swedish, or Finnish, or possibly Estonian, he wasn't sure, but she had great hair and had given him her Instagram and this was basically a proposal. Connor listened with the fractional attention of a man whose mind was elsewhere, in a prison forty kilometres south, in a holding cell, in the back of a bus on the North-South Expressway where a drug dog was moving down the aisle and the suitcase in the overhead compartment was humming with the energy of three hundred grams of compressed catastrophe.

*It's not the same,* the machine said. The machine was drunk but still operational, still producing its product, still smoothing the rough edges of reality into shapes Connor could hold without cutting himself. *David's brother was unlucky. David's brother trusted the wrong person. I trust Felix, and Felix is different, because Felix is my mate, and David's brother's recruiter was a stranger, and the situations are completely different.*

They were not completely different. They were, in fact, identical -- the same mechanism, the same design, the same trap baited with the same friendship and the same money and the same carefully engineered ignorance. The only difference was time. David's brother was five years ahead of Connor on the same road, and the road's destination was the same, and the road did not fork or bend or offer exits. It went in one direction, and the direction was Kajang Prison, and beyond Kajang, a room with a rope, and beyond the room, nothing.

But Connor could not see the road because Connor was on the road, and when you are on a road, the road looks like the ground, and the ground looks like the only option, and the only option looks like a choice.

They reached Petaling Street. The market was collapsed for the night -- stalls shuttered, tarps tied, the corridor empty except for a few last food vendors sweating over cooling grills. The Guan Di Temple was dark, its red doors shut, incense still leaking from the gaps. The Chinese medicine store was a wall of shadows behind glass.

Wei's phone repair shop was dark too. For once, the fluorescent light was off. The cluttered window display -- cracked phones, coiled cables, the handwritten sign -- was barely visible in the street's ambient light. Connor glanced at it as he passed. A reflex. The glance lasted less than a second and contained no conscious thought, but his eyes registered something his mind would not process until much later: on the counter inside the shop, barely visible through the glass, a digital scale. The kind with a flat metal platform and an LCD readout. The kind used to weigh things in grams.

He walked past.

The hostel's red lanterns were off -- they were on a timer, midnight shutdown, though their glow lingered in the retina the way afterimages did. Connor pushed through the front door. The reception counter was unattended, Mei Ling long gone, replaced by the honesty system of an unlocked door and the assumption that backpackers who came home at two AM were not a security risk.

Jake headed for Dorm 1. "Night, dude. Epic night."

"Night, mate."

Connor climbed the staircase. On the second-floor landing, the Japanese characters waited under their layer of paint, patient and illegible. He pushed open the door to Dorm 3. The dorm was dark. Bodies in bunks, the anonymous shapes of sleeping travelers, the collective breathing of strangers sharing air.

He sat on the edge of Bed 7 and pulled off his flip-flops. His head was thick with beer and shots and the residue of David's story, which had settled into his consciousness the way silt settles after a flood -- covering everything, changing the colour of the water, making it impossible to see the bottom.

The burner phone was on the mattress where he'd left it. He picked it up. No messages. The screen glowed briefly, a flat blue rectangle in the dark, then dimmed. He set it down.

He lay back. The blue towel was under his pillow. He pulled it out and draped it across his chest, the ritual gesture, the comfort object, the microfiber membrane between him and the world.

*Mandatory death sentence.*

He closed his eyes.

*No exceptions for foreigners.*

He turned over.

*Be careful who you trust.*

He pulled the towel tighter.

*The ease is what they're selling you.*

The ceiling fan turned. *Tick, tick, tick.* The building creaked. The city hummed. And in the dark, in the quiet, in the space between waking and sleep, the machine faltered.

It didn't stop. The machine never stopped. But it faltered -- a skip, a stutter, a momentary gap in the continuous production of reassurance. And in that gap, in the half-second of silence between one lie and the next, Connor Briggs felt the full weight of what he was doing land on his chest like a stone, and the weight was real and the stone was real and for one fractured, terrifying moment he saw himself as he was: a man carrying packages for a stranger, in a country that killed people for carrying packages, and the packages were not phone components, and he knew they were not phone components, and he had always known, and the knowing was the thing the machine existed to bury.

The moment lasted. It lasted the way a match lasts -- bright, brief, illuminating the dark with a clarity that was almost cruel. He saw the room. He saw the bed. He saw the towel on his chest. He saw the two phones on the mattress. He saw the schedule in his daypack. He saw the name on the bed frame.

Then the moment passed.

The machine recovered. The gears caught. The production resumed. The rationalizations arrived in their familiar order -- *it's different, I'm different, Felix is different, the packages are different, the money is different, I'm Australian, she'll be right, nothing's happened, nothing will happen* -- and the stone on his chest dissolved into the general numbness of four AM and six beers and the body's desperate need for sleep.

Connor slept. The building held him. And in Kajang Prison, forty kilometres south, a man named Steve who had once been a backpacker in a Chinatown hostel stared at a concrete ceiling and counted the days, which was what you did when the days were all you had, when the days were numbered, when the number had been set by a judge in a courtroom and the number meant the days would end and after the days ended there was nothing, just the ceiling and the concrete and the memory of a bar in KL where someone had offered him easy money and he had said yes without asking why the money was easy.

Two men in two rooms in the same city. One with a sentence. One carrying the evidence for his.

Dawn was coming.

---

Morning came the way KL mornings came: with heat and noise and the call to prayer and the smell of Mama Siti's kitchen.

Connor woke at ten. Headache. Dry mouth. The specific hangover that was equal parts alcohol and sleep deprivation, the body's invoice for the previous night's expenditure. He lay in Bed 7 and waited for the room to stabilise -- the ceiling fan spinning, the light from the air well making the dorm's contents visible in soft grey: the bunks, the lockers, the backpacks, the accumulated personal effects of eight transient lives.

The burner phone buzzed.

He reached for it with the practised reflex that two weeks of the schedule had already built into his nervous system. The message was from Felix:

*Friday delivery. Package at Wei's shop. Pick up by 11. Drop at Bukit Bintang, Lot 22B. Danny. RM400.*

Connor read the message. He read it again. The words were the same words they always were -- a pickup, a destination, a name, a number. The machinery of the schedule, ticking over, indifferent to what he'd heard the night before, indifferent to David's story, indifferent to the stone on his chest that had not fully dissolved.

He lay there. Through the air well, the sounds and smells of the hostel's morning: water running, a door closing, the sulfurous whiff from the drains that the heat always stirred, the clang of something in the kitchen, Mama Siti's voice saying something in Malay that contained the word *bodoh*, which Connor had learned meant *stupid* and which Mama Siti applied to a generous range of subjects including the stove, the plumbing, the government, and most of her guests.

He could stop. The thought was there, clear and available, sitting at the front of his mind like an exit sign above a door. He could text Felix and say *I'm done*. He could delete the schedule, throw away the burner phone, and go back to being a broke backpacker with a cracked phone and 4,200 followers and a parents' deposit that kept him alive. He could go home. He could walk out of this building and take a Grab to KLIA2 and board a flight to Melbourne and be in his mother's kitchen by tomorrow morning, eating Vegemite toast and being asked about his plans and knowing that the question had no answer but that the asking was not dangerous.

He could stop.

The thought sat there. The exit sign glowed.

He picked up the burner phone and typed: *On it.*

The exit sign went dark.

Connor Briggs swung his legs off Bed 7, pulled on a singlet -- GOOD VIBES ONLY, the same one from yesterday, slightly beer-scented -- and went downstairs to collect a package from a phone repair shop that repaired no phones, to carry it across a city that would kill him for carrying it, for money that was not money but the price of his own ignorance, which he had placed on the counter and accepted in exchange for the life that was already ending, one delivery at a time.

Mama Siti watched him pass through the kitchen. She did not offer nasi lemak. She did not speak. She stirred her pot and looked at the boy and her lips moved once, forming a word that might have been a prayer or might have been a proverb or might have been the Malay word for *gone*, which was *pergi*, which was what you said when someone left a room and also what you said when someone left the world.

The front door opened. The heat rushed in. Connor stepped through.

The door closed behind him.

Mama Siti stirred.
