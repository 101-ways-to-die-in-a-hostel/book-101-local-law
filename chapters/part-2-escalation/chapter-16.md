# Chapter 16: Tomoko's Camera

Day 24 began with a delivery to Chow Kit that left a taste in Connor's mouth like copper.

Not literally -- the taste was metaphorical, the taste of something wrong, the lingering aftertaste of a morning that had been subtly different from every other morning. The difference was in the pickup. Felix had not been in his room when Connor knocked at nine. Instead, the door was ajar, a package on the desk -- sports bag, black nylon, zipped shut -- with a Post-it note in Felix's handwriting: *Chow Kit. Auntie Lim. Usual spot.*

Felix had never left a package unattended before. Felix had always been there for the handoff -- the eye contact, the brief instruction, the warmth that made the transaction feel like friendship rather than commerce. The empty room, the package on the desk, the Post-it note -- these were the mechanics of a different arrangement, an arrangement that no longer required the human element because the human element was already trained and the training was complete.

Connor took the package. Rode a Grab to Chow Kit. Walked through the morning market -- Chow Kit Market, the sprawling wet market where the smell of fresh fish and raw meat and the metallic tang of blood on butcher's blocks combined into something that was simultaneously repulsive and vital, the smell of a city feeding itself. Women in headscarves moved between stalls of vegetables and spices, their shopping bags swelling. Men carried crates of live chickens past bins of dried shrimp and towers of durian. The market was loud and close and alive in the way that only markets in this part of the world were alive -- every sense saturated, every surface wet, every voice raised.

He found Jalan Raja Bot 12. Knocked. Auntie Lim -- small, sixties, silver hair in a tight bun, her face a map of wrinkles that suggested she had been frowning professionally for decades -- took the bag through a door that opened onto a corridor that smelled of incense and chemical solvent. She closed the door without nodding. This was new. The nod had been part of the protocol -- the acknowledgement, the confirmation, the small human signal that the transaction was complete. Its absence left a gap, a silence where a signal should have been, and the gap was the thing that tasted like copper.

RM350. The money arrived. The money always arrived.

He went home. He showered. And at four in the afternoon, the photographs were on the common room table, arranged in a grid, and they were the most dangerous things in the building.

Tomoko had printed them at the same internet café Priya had used -- terminal four, the one by the window where the afternoon light hit the screen and made the images glow. She had uploaded sixteen photographs from the SD card of her Nikon D850, selected the eight most relevant, and printed them on the café's colour printer, which rendered them in the slightly oversaturated tones of cheap ink on cheap paper, the colours too vivid, the shadows too dark, the overall effect somewhere between documentary evidence and art.

She laid them on the coffee table in two rows of four. Each photograph was labelled on the back in her precise, small handwriting: date, time, location. She had been watching for weeks. The photographs were the harvest.

Connor came downstairs at four fifteen, freshly showered, his hair still wet, wearing a singlet that said WANDERLUST in a font designed in a factory in Shenzhen. He was heading for the door -- Grind Culture, the afternoon flat white, the performance of productivity that had become as much a part of his routine as the deliveries. He saw Tomoko sitting in the armchair. He saw the photographs on the table. He kept walking.

"Connor." Her voice was calm, level, carrying the weight of something rehearsed. "Sit down. Please."

"I'm heading out--"

"This will take five minutes."

He looked at her. She was wearing her usual uniform -- black T-shirt, cargo pants, the red-tipped hair pulled back. No camera today. The camera was in her room, its memory card backed up to a cloud server in Tokyo that Tomoko had configured with the paranoia of a journalist who had worked in Myanmar and learned that hardware was confiscatable but data was not.

Connor sat. Not because he wanted to but because the alternative -- walking past her, ignoring the photographs, performing the kind of aggressive avoidance that would confirm everything she suspected -- was worse than sitting.

"What are these?"

"Look at them."

He looked.

The first row:

**Photo 1.** Felix and Wei in Wei's phone repair shop. Night. The fluorescent light casting its blue-white pall through the glass. Felix's hands flat on the counter, leaning forward. Wei opposite. Between them, on the counter, a package -- brown paper, rectangular, taped shut. The same brown paper. The same tape. The same packages Connor had been carrying. Date: eleven days ago. Time: 11:47 PM.

**Photo 2.** A man Connor didn't recognise entering the hostel's alley entrance -- the back door, the one that led from the narrow lorong behind the building through a gate and into the ground floor's utility corridor. The man was carrying a large holdall. He was not a guest. The date was nine days ago. Time: 1:12 AM.

**Photo 3.** The same man leaving the hostel's alley entrance forty minutes later. No holdall. Time: 1:54 AM.

**Photo 4.** Felix on the rooftop, talking on his phone. His expression was the one Connor had seen through Wei's shop window that night -- flat, focused, emptied of charm. The Felix behind the mask. Date: six days ago. Time: 2:23 AM. Tomoko had been on the rooftop in the dark, camera in hand, her presence undetected because Tomoko moved through the world the way experienced journalists moved through the world -- silently, watchfully, with the patience of someone who understood that the truth was usually found in the spaces between noise.

The second row:

**Photo 5.** Wei's shop, daytime. Shot through the window at an angle. On the workbench behind the counter, visible among the phone screens and soldering equipment: a digital scale. The kind with a flat metal platform and an LCD readout. The kind used to weigh things in grams.

**Photo 6.** Felix entering a black sedan on Jalan Sultan. Night. The driver was visible through the windshield -- a man in his fifties, Chinese-Malaysian, wearing a dark polo shirt. The sedan's plates were partially visible. Felix was carrying a large backpack -- not his own, not the daypack he used daily, but a larger bag, full, the straps tight.

**Photo 7.** Connor. Walking down Petaling Street. Morning. Daypack on his shoulder, the bulge of a package visible through the nylon. His face in profile, caught mid-stride, his expression blank, emptied, the face of a man performing a task he has stopped thinking about. He looked, in the photograph, like a delivery driver. He looked like exactly what he was.

**Photo 8.** The hostel's entrance at night. The red lanterns glowing. And on the wall beside the door, barely visible in the low light, fresh graffiti that hadn't been there the week before. Two words, in black marker, in a hand that was neither artistic nor careless: @HOSTELREAPER. Beneath it, a small symbol -- a scythe, or an hourglass, or something in between.

Connor looked at the photographs. The photographs looked back.

They were clear. They were dated. They were the kind of evidence that a journalist assembled not for publication but for proof -- proof that a pattern existed, proof that the pattern was consistent, proof that the person denying the pattern was the person most deeply embedded in it.

"These don't prove anything," Connor said.

He said it automatically, the way the machine produced its output -- without deliberation, without pause, the defence emerging fully formed from the assembly line of denial. The sentence was in the air before he'd finished looking at the photographs, which meant the sentence was not a response to the photographs but a pre-loaded response to any evidence, any challenge, any information that threatened the structure.

Tomoko didn't argue. She picked up photograph number one -- Felix and Wei -- and held it up. "This is your friend Felix, at one in the morning, in a phone repair shop, with a package identical to the ones you carry. The shop is closed. The owner is not repairing phones. They are looking at a package on the counter. What do you think they're doing?"

"I don't know. Business meeting. Felix does import--"

"Import-export." Tomoko said the words the way you'd say the name of a disease you'd identified too many times. "Import-export is the cover story. It's the same cover story in every country I've worked in. In Myanmar, they said import-export. In Laos, they said import-export. In the Philippines, they said logistics consulting. The words change. The mechanism doesn't."

She picked up photograph seven. Connor. Walking. Carrying.

"This is you, Connor. This is what you look like from outside. You look like a courier. You look like a man carrying something he hasn't checked, to somewhere he doesn't question, for someone he doesn't know."

"I know Felix."

"You know what Felix shows you. I've been a journalist for seven years. I've covered drug networks in three countries. The person who recruits the mule is never the person the mule thinks they know. They're a performance. A mask. A character designed to produce trust."

Connor's jaw tightened. He could feel the anger building -- not the clean anger of being falsely accused but the hot, defensive anger of being accurately described. The anger that comes when someone points at the thing you've been hiding from yourself and gives it a name.

"You've been stalking me," he said. "You've been following me around the city taking photos of me without my permission."

"I've been documenting a trafficking operation that runs out of the building I sleep in. You happen to be part of it."

"I'm not part of anything--"

"You are. You just don't want to know what." She set the photograph down. "I'm not showing you these to accuse you. I'm showing you because I want you to see what I see. And what I see is a young man being used by a professional criminal, in a country where being used by a professional criminal gets you killed."

The common room was empty except for the two of them. The TV was off. The ceiling fans turned. Through the air well, the afternoon call to prayer began, the muezzin's voice rising from Masjid Jamek with the particular beauty that Islamic prayer possessed -- a beauty that existed regardless of whether the listener understood the words, a beauty that asked for nothing and offered everything.

Connor looked at the photographs. Photograph seven -- himself, walking, carrying -- was the one his eyes kept returning to. He looked at his own face in the image. The expression was blank. Not happy, not afraid, not aware. Blank. The face of a man on autopilot, executing a programme he hadn't written, moving through a city he didn't understand toward a destination he hadn't chosen.

He looked like a mule.

The word arrived and he couldn't deflect it this time. The photograph was too clear, the image too precise, the evidence too visual. In words, the accusation could be argued with. In photographs, the truth was flattened into two dimensions and made inescapable, the way a mirror is inescapable, the way your own face is inescapable when you're forced to look at it without the filter of your own narrative.

The moment lasted three seconds. In those three seconds, the machine stuttered. The gears slipped. The production line halted, and in the silence, the truth was briefly, painfully visible -- not as a thought but as a sensation, a full-body recognition that he was in danger, that the danger was real, that the photographs on the table were a map of his own destruction and the map was accurate and the destination was fixed.

Then the machine caught. The gears engaged. The production resumed.

"You don't know what you're talking about," Connor said. His voice was quiet now -- the anger had burned through its fuel and what remained was something harder, colder, the voice of a man building a wall brick by brick. "Felix is my friend. The packages are phone components. Your photos prove nothing except that you've been creeping around the hostel at night with a camera, which frankly is more suspicious than anything I've done."

Tomoko watched him. Her expression did not change. She had the stillness of a woman who had sat across from people in denial before -- in Yangon, in Vientiane, in Manila -- and had learned that the denial was not the obstacle. The denial was the symptom. The obstacle was the fear that the denial was protecting, and the fear could not be reached by argument because fear was not an argument. Fear was a wall. And walls could only be broken by what was on the other side, pressing outward, demanding space.

"I'm going to keep watching," she said. "I'm going to keep photographing. And when the time comes -- when the evidence is complete -- I'm going to take it to someone who can use it."

"Who? The police? Go ahead. Call the police. Tell them you've been stalking guests at a hostel with your camera. See how that goes."

"I wasn't thinking of the police." She gathered the photographs from the table, stacking them with the careful alignment of a person handling evidence. "I was thinking of someone at The Star. Or The Guardian. Or the Australian embassy."

She stood. The photographs disappeared into a manila envelope she'd been holding behind the armchair. The envelope went under her arm with the quiet efficiency of someone who knew the value of what she was carrying.

"Connor," she said. She stood over him, and for a moment, the journalist dropped away and what remained was a person -- a twenty-nine-year-old woman from Osaka who had seen too much of the world's cruelty and could not stop trying to prevent it, even when the people she was trying to save were the ones fighting hardest to stay in danger.

"I like you," she said. "You're funny and you're kind, when you're not being a fool. But you are being a fool. And if you don't stop, what happens next will not be funny and it will not be kind, and there will be no photograph that can help you."

She left. Her door on the third floor opened and closed.

---

Connor sat in the common room alone. The coffee table was empty. The photographs were gone. But their afterimages remained -- burned into his retinas, the way bright lights left shadows when you closed your eyes. Felix and Wei. The midnight visitor. The digital scale. Himself, carrying, blank-faced, a courier in profile.

He sat for fifteen minutes without moving. Through the air well, the afternoon call to prayer ended, the muezzin's voice descending to silence, and in the silence the hostel breathed and the hostel remembered and the hostel waited with the patience of something that had been waiting for a very long time.

Then he stood. He went to the staircase. He climbed to the third floor, past the Japanese characters, past the blue tiles, to Felix's door.

He knocked.

Felix opened. The smile appeared -- warm, generous, the Felix that Connor knew and needed.

"Hey, mate. What's up?"

"Tomoko," Connor said. "She's been taking photos. Of you, of me, of the deliveries. She has pictures of us at Wei's shop, pictures of the packages, pictures of me carrying. She says she's going to take them to someone."

He said it the way a soldier reports enemy positions -- factual, urgent, loyal. He was reporting the threat to his commander. He was protecting the operation. He was choosing, in this moment, the side he had chosen since the first envelope, the side of easy money and warm friendship and the comfortable lie, and the choosing was so natural that it didn't feel like choosing at all. It felt like reflex. It felt like gravity. It felt like the ground.

Felix's expression changed. The smile didn't vanish -- it altered, reconfiguring into something thinner, more focused, the smile of a man who has received tactical intelligence and is already processing countermeasures. His eyes moved to a place Connor couldn't see -- the space behind the eyes where calculations happened, where variables were adjusted and risks were assessed and expendable elements were identified.

"How many photos?" Felix's voice was calm. The German accent was slightly more pronounced, the precision of the consonants sharpening, the way they did when Felix was working.

"Eight. Printed. She said she has more on her camera."

"Where does she keep the camera?"

"Her room, I think. Dorm 5."

Felix nodded. The nod was slow, deliberate, the nod of a man adding an item to a list. "Don't worry about Tomoko," he said. "I'll handle it."

"What does that mean?"

"It means I'll talk to her. Journalist to photographer. Professional courtesy." The smile returned, fuller now, warmer, the mask repaired, the surface restored. "She's just being thorough. It's what journalists do. I respect it. But she doesn't have the full picture, and once I explain the business properly, she'll understand."

Connor nodded. The nodding was easy. Nodding was what he did when Felix spoke, the physical affirmation that the words were landing, that the explanation was sufficient, that the world Felix described was the world they lived in.

"Thanks, mate," Connor said. "Sorry for the--"

"No need to apologise. You did the right thing, telling me."

"Of course. We're a team."

The word *team* sat between them -- a word that Connor believed and Felix used, the way a carpenter uses a hammer: to drive things into place. Felix clapped Connor on the shoulder. The hand was warm. The gesture was intimate. The intimacy was engineered.

"Go have your coffee," Felix said. "I'll sort this out."

Connor left. He went to Grind Culture. He ordered his flat white. He sat at his window table and posted a sunset photo for Pacific Soul and felt the relief of a man who has passed a problem to someone competent, the way you feel when the mechanic says "I'll fix it" and you believe him because believing him is easier than understanding the engine.

He did not think about what "I'll handle it" meant. He did not think about why Felix had asked where Tomoko kept her camera. He did not think about the word *handle* and its implications, or the look in Felix's eyes when Connor had said *Dorm 5*, or the slow nod that had added something to a list Connor could not see.

The flat white was good. The Wi-Fi was strong. The afternoon passed.

---

Three days later, Tomoko's camera was gone.

She reported it to Mei Ling at reception. Her room had been entered while she was out -- no sign of forced entry, but the Nikon D850 was missing from its case. The SD cards, two of them, were also gone. Her laptop was untouched. Her money was untouched. Only the camera and the cards.

Mei Ling documented the theft in the guest complaint ledger. She offered to call the police. Tomoko declined. She knew who had taken the camera. She knew why. And she knew that calling the police would alert the people she was trying to document, which would make the documentation impossible, which was the entire point of the theft.

Tomoko stood at the reception counter, her expression flat, her fists clenched at her sides. She looked at the common room where Connor was sitting on the sofa, scrolling his phone, performing ignorance with the fluency of a native speaker.

"You told him," she said, across the room, her voice carrying the cold, precise weight of someone stating a fact.

Connor looked up. "What?"

"You told Felix about the photographs. And now my camera is gone."

"I didn't--"

"Don't." The word was a door slamming. "Don't lie to me. You told him, and he sent someone to take my camera, and now the evidence is gone, and you did this. You did this because you chose him over the truth."

The common room was not empty. Two Dutch backpackers were playing cards at the far table. They looked up, looked at Tomoko, looked at Connor, and performed the universal backpacker response to interpersonal conflict: they put their heads down and pretended the room contained only them and the cards.

Connor opened his mouth. The machine tried to produce a defence but the machine had been running hard for weeks and the gears were grinding and what came out was not a defence but a silence, and the silence was the most honest thing he'd said in a month.

Tomoko looked at him. The look lasted five seconds. In those five seconds, something ended -- the last residual goodwill, the last trace of the concern that had motivated her to show him the photographs, the last molecular bond of human care that had connected a Japanese journalist to an Australian courier across a coffee table in a hostel in Chinatown.

"I backed up the photos," she said. "Cloud storage. You can steal a camera but you can't steal a cloud." She paused. "When this ends -- and it will end, Connor, the same way it always ends -- remember that I tried. Remember that we all tried."

She climbed the staircase. Her footsteps continued to the third floor. Her door opened and closed with a sound that was final in a way that transcended the mechanics of hinges and frames. It was the sound of a witness deciding that the witness phase was over, and the next phase was coming, and the next phase would involve not a camera but a keyboard, and not photographs but words, and the words would be published, and the published words would outlast the camera and the photographs and the evidence and the man who had caused them to be stolen.

Connor sat on the sofa. The Dutch backpackers played cards.

---

That evening, Priya found him on the rooftop.

He was sitting in the dark, no beer this time, just the plastic chair and the humid air and the Petronas Towers doing their permanent silver performance against the night sky. He wasn't looking at his phone. He wasn't doing anything. He was sitting absolutely still, hands on his knees, staring at nothing, waiting for the numbness to wear off and the feeling to arrive.

Priya sat in the chair beside him. She didn't speak immediately. She let the silence hold, the way she did when she was being a doctor rather than a girlfriend, giving the patient space to arrive at the conversation in their own time.

"Tomoko told me about the camera," she said, eventually.

"Yeah."

"You told Felix about her photographs."

"I told him because she was going to make trouble. She was going to go to the papers, the embassy, the -- I was protecting--"

"You were protecting Felix."

The sentence was accurate and it cut. Connor felt it land below the numbness, in the place where the things he didn't want to know lived.

"I was protecting myself," he said. "If those photos went public -- if she went to the Australian embassy and said I was doing deliveries for someone -- that's my reputation. That's my travel life. That's everything."

"That's your concern? Your *reputation*?"

"Don't do that. Don't make it sound stupid."

"It is stupid, Connor. Your reputation is not the thing at risk here. Your *life* is the thing at risk. Tomoko wasn't going to the embassy to embarrass you. She was going because she thought it might save you. And instead of letting her try, you went to Felix and handed him the information he needed to shut her down."

Connor opened his mouth. The machine tried to engage. But the machine was exhausted -- weeks of continuous operation, the gears worn, the belts stretched, the motor overheating. What came out was not a defence but a sound, a small exhalation, the sound of something deflating.

"I know," he said.

The words surprised him. They surprised Priya too -- he could feel her posture shift, the slight forward lean of someone who has been pushing against a door and felt it give.

"You know what?"

"I know I shouldn't have told him. I know the camera -- I know that was because of me." He rubbed his face with both hands. The stubble scraped his palms. "I just -- Priya, I don't know how to stop. I'm in it now. The schedule, the money, the people who take the packages. They know my face. They know where I live. If I stop, Felix will -- I don't know what Felix will do."

It was the most honest thing he had said since arriving in KL. The words came from beneath the machine, from the dark space where the truth lived, the space that the rationalisations were designed to keep sealed. The truth was simple and enormous: he was afraid. Not of the law, not of the police, not even of the death penalty. He was afraid of Felix. He was afraid of what Felix represented -- the infrastructure, the network, the system that had absorbed him so completely that extraction felt impossible.

Priya reached for his hand. He let her take it. Her fingers were cool, the jade bracelet sliding against his wrist.

"You can stop," she said. "Right now. Tonight. You can go to Sergeant Ahmad -- you told me about the card, Connor, I know you have it -- and you can tell him everything. What you've carried, where you've taken it, who gave it to you. They'll protect you. You'll be a witness, not a defendant."

"And Felix?"

"Felix will be arrested. Or he'll run. Either way, he won't be your problem anymore."

"He'll know it was me. The network -- they'll know I talked."

"The network is already watching you. Tomoko's photos prove that. The man who comes at one AM with a holdall? He's not delivering phone accessories, Connor. He's a supplier. And suppliers know their couriers. If you don't stop, the only question is whether you get caught by the police first or used up by the network first, and I don't know which outcome is worse."

The Petronas Towers glowed. The city hummed. A plane descended toward KLIA, its lights blinking, carrying someone new toward a city that was simultaneously beautiful and lethal, the way all beautiful things were lethal when you mistook the surface for the substance.

"I'll think about it," Connor said.

"Don't think about it. Do it."

"I'll think about it."

Priya held his hand. She held it the way you hold something you know you're about to lose -- tightly, completely, with every finger and every gram of pressure, as though the holding itself could prevent the letting go.

"I love you," she said. She hadn't said it before. The words arrived in the space between them with the weight of something that had been carried a long time and was being set down, carefully, in the dark. "I love you and I'm terrified. And if you don't stop, I'm going to have to watch something happen to you that I can't prevent, and that will break me, Connor. Not in the way heartbreak usually works -- in the way that bone breaks. The way that things break when they can't bend anymore."

He turned to her. In the dark, her face was visible only by the city's ambient light -- the round glasses reflecting orange, her eyes dark and steady, her expression carrying the weight of everything she'd tried to tell him and everything he'd refused to hear.

"I love you too," he said, and he meant it, and the meaning was the truest thing in his life, and the truest thing in his life was not enough to save him.

They sat on the rooftop. They held hands. The night passed. Neither of them mentioned the photographs, or the camera, or the printed law, or the business card in Connor's wallet. They sat in the dark and held onto each other and the holding was the only thing either of them had, the only thing that didn't require a decision or an action or a confrontation with the truth, the only thing that was simply human and simply real in a situation that had become neither.

The building breathed. The fans turned. And in her room on the third floor, Tomoko Sato sat at a desk with her laptop open, composing an email to a contact at The Star newspaper, attaching files from a cloud server in Tokyo, writing in English that was precise and economical and contained no adjectives that weren't necessary, the way she wrote everything, the way a scalpel contains no metal that isn't necessary.

The subject line read: *Drug trafficking operation -- Petaling Street hostel -- evidence attached.*

She read it once. She read it twice.

She did not press send. Not yet. The evidence wasn't complete. The camera was gone but the cloud wasn't, and the cloud contained sixteen photographs, and the photographs contained a story, and the story was still being written by a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in a WANDERLUST singlet who was sitting on a rooftop holding hands with a woman who had tried to save him and failing, night by night, delivery by delivery, to save himself.
