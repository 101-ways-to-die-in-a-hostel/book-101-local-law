# Chapter 11: The Upgrade

The rooftop at six in the morning was a different country.

The plastic chairs were beaded with dew -- the overnight condensation that settled on every surface in KL like a tax levied by the climate. The clothesline hung empty, its nylon cord sagging between two poles in a curve that caught the first grey light. The Petronas Towers were silhouettes against a sky the colour of dishwater, their silver cladding not yet lit, their twin forms rising into the low cloud like something waiting to be revealed. Below, the city was stirring but not yet awake -- the distant diesel cough of a bus on Jalan Sultan, the metallic clatter of a shophouse shutter going up too early, and from somewhere close, the last trailing note of the Fajr call to prayer from Masjid Jamek, thin and wavering and ancient, fading into the hum of air-conditioning units on a hundred rooftops.

Connor sat in the plastic chair, shirtless, in board shorts and flip-flops, his hair a monument to the night's humidity. His singlet -- GOOD VIBES ONLY -- was balled in his fist because putting it on had seemed like too much commitment at six AM. The air was warm but not yet aggressive, the brief window between the cool of pre-dawn and the furnace-blast of a KL morning. In two hours the sun would turn the zinc roof into a griddle. Now it was almost pleasant.

Felix stood at the railing. He'd pulled two Tiger beers from somewhere -- cold, sweating, the kind of gesture that was so perfectly timed it felt rehearsed. He set one on the arm of Connor's chair without asking.

"Beer at six AM?" Connor said.

"It's a special occasion."

"What occasion?"

Felix turned from the railing. The scar on his eyebrow caught the early light. He was wearing a clean white linen shirt, untucked, sleeves rolled to the elbow. His leather sandals looked new. Everything about Felix looked deliberate in a way that Connor admired without examining -- the way you admire a building's architecture without wondering about the foundation.

"I've been thinking," Felix said. "About you."

"Flattering."

Felix didn't smile. This was notable. Felix's smile was his primary tool, deployed with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel -- to disarm, to include, to create the warm illusion that you were the most important person in the room. The absence of the smile meant something, though Connor was not equipped to read what.

"You've been reliable, Connor. Four jobs, no problems. No questions." He paused on the word *questions* the way you'd pause on a speed bump -- acknowledging it existed without slowing down. "I appreciate that. Most people I work with ask too many questions, or they get nervous, or they talk. You don't talk."

"I'm an easy-going bloke."

"You are. And that's valuable." Felix pulled a chair around to face Connor and sat in it the way Europeans sat -- upright, knees apart, elbows on thighs, the posture of a man conducting an interview he'd already decided the outcome of. "The deliveries you've been doing -- the envelopes, the packages -- those are small. Entry-level. Think of them as... the probation period."

"Probation." Connor repeated the word and felt something move in his stomach -- not alarm, exactly, but the distant cousin of alarm, the first faint signal from a warning system he'd spent twenty-seven years learning to ignore. The word *probation* implied a structure, and structures implied organisations, and organisations implied something larger than two mates helping each other out.

"Let me explain," Felix said. "I work with an import-export company. Based in Hong Kong. We handle logistics for various products moving through Southeast Asia. Electronics, phone components, specialty goods. The company has partners in KL, Penang, Singapore, Bangkok. The envelopes and packages you've been carrying -- those are samples, invoices, small shipments. Routine stuff."

He spoke with the calm, measured cadence of a man reading from a script he'd polished through repetition, each word tested for weight and placed with care. The German accent softened the edges. The early-morning light softened everything else.

"But the business is growing. More product, more routes, more volume. I need someone here -- in KL, at this hostel, who can handle regular pickups and drop-offs. Not one-offs. A schedule. Three, maybe four times a week. Bigger items sometimes -- not envelopes. Backpacks. Suitcases. You'd be the KL leg of a chain that runs from here to Penang, sometimes to Singapore."

Connor drank his beer. The Tiger was cold and thin and tasted like every other Tiger he'd drunk in Southeast Asia, which was to say it tasted like being somewhere that wasn't home. He was aware of a sensation he did not immediately recognise, because it was not a sensation he often experienced. The sensation was hesitation.

"Backpacks?" he said.

"Backpacks. Sometimes boxes. Nothing that would look unusual -- you're a backpacker carrying a backpack, or a tourist with luggage. The items go from a pickup point to a drop-off point. Same as before, just more frequent and higher volume."

"And the money?"

Felix reached into the pocket of his linen shorts and produced his phone. He opened a banking app -- European, the interface in German -- and turned the screen toward Connor. The balance was visible for approximately two seconds, long enough for Connor to register the number and feel his pupils dilate.

"That's what three months of this work looks like," Felix said. "For me, at my level. You'd start lower, obviously. But RM2,000 a week is realistic. More, once you're established."

RM2,000 a week. Connor's parents sent him $2,000 Australian per month -- roughly RM6,000. Felix was offering him the same amount in three weeks, for work that took a few hours a day. The arithmetic was immediate and intoxicating, the way all arithmetic is when it tells you what you want to hear.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Instagram notification. He ignored it.

"That's..." Connor started, and the word he wanted was *insane* but the word that came out was "serious money."

"It is serious money. Because it's serious work. Not dangerous," Felix added, reading the thought before it formed, "but serious. Regular. Professional. You'd need to be punctual, discreet, and reliable. No telling people what you're doing -- not Jake, not Priya, not the hostel staff. This stays between us."

The hesitation was still there, a small stone in the mechanism of Connor's confidence. He could feel it catching on something, producing a sound he'd never heard before: doubt. Not the intellectual doubt of someone weighing evidence -- Connor didn't weigh evidence, he surfed over it -- but the bodily doubt of an animal that senses a change in the air before the storm arrives. His stomach was doing something it didn't usually do. His palms were damp, which he attributed to the humidity.

"Felix," he said. "Mate. Level with me."

Felix waited. His eyes were steady, the colour of creek water, and they held Connor's gaze with the patience of someone who had played this scene before and knew every possible line the other actor might deliver.

"This is all legit, yeah? Import-export. Phone stuff. Because I'm not--" He laughed, the defensive laugh, the laugh that precedes a sentence the speaker doesn't want to finish. "I mean, I'm not carrying drugs or anything. That's not--"

"Connor." Felix's voice was gentle, almost parental -- the tone of a father explaining to a child that the noise in the night is just the wind. "I'm a photographer. I do logistics work to fund my travels, the same way you do social media consulting. If I were involved in anything illegal, do you think I'd be living in a hostel in Chinatown? I'd be in a penthouse in KLCC."

The logic was so clean it gleamed. Connor picked it up and turned it over and found no scratches.

"Besides," Felix said, leaning back, letting the tension drain from his posture with the deliberate ease of a man releasing a hooked fish back into the water, "this is Malaysia. You've seen the signs at the airport. You know what happens to people who deal drugs here. You think I'd risk that? You think I'd put *you* at risk?"

The sign at the airport. Connor had walked past it on Day 1 -- red text, white background, the Malay crest. DADAH MEMBAWA MAUT. He hadn't read it. He hadn't read it but he'd seen it, and the seeing was enough for Felix to reference, enough to create the impression that Connor was informed, that Connor had considered the risks and judged them acceptable, that Connor was making an educated decision.

He wasn't. He was making the decision the way he'd made every decision since leaving Monash University: by following the path that felt good and assuming the universe would handle the rest.

"Yeah, no, of course," Connor said. "Sorry, mate. Didn't mean to--"

"No need to apologise." Felix smiled. The smile was back, warm and generous, and its return was like sunlight breaking through clouds -- a relief so palpable that Connor felt grateful, actually grateful, that Felix wasn't offended by the question. This was the mechanism at work: the brief withdrawal of warmth created a vacuum, and the vacuum created need, and the need made the return of warmth feel like a gift rather than a manipulation. It was textbook. Felix had learned it from a man in Bangkok who'd learned it from a woman in Guangzhou who'd learned it from whoever first discovered that love, strategically withheld, becomes a tool.

"Take today to think about it," Felix said. "No pressure. If you want to keep doing the small stuff, that's fine. But this is a proper opportunity, Connor. The kind of money that means you don't have to go home. The kind of money that means you stay."

He stood. Collected both beer bottles -- his half-finished, Connor's nearly empty. Walked to the rooftop door. At the threshold, he turned.

"RM2,000 a week, Connor. How long would that keep you here?"

The door closed. Felix's footsteps descended the staircase -- quiet, measured, the third step not squeaking because Felix had learned, as all predators learn, the exact geography of the terrain they hunted.

---

Connor sat on the rooftop for an hour.

The sun climbed. The dishwater sky brightened to white, then to the flat, merciless blue that KL produced on clear mornings, the blue that promised heat and delivered on the promise by nine. The Petronas Towers caught the light and became mirrors, throwing silver across the skyline. Below, the city was fully awake now: the motorcycle chorus, the vendor calls, the steady percussion of construction somewhere behind the hostel where a new condo was going up, crane visible above the shophouse rooftops like a mechanical bird feeding on concrete.

He thought about money.

This was what Connor did when the world presented him with a decision that had moral dimensions: he converted it into a financial problem, because financial problems had clean solutions and moral problems did not. The question was not *should I do this* but *can I afford not to*.

The arithmetic: RM2,000 a week was RM8,000 a month. His current expenses -- hostel (RM70/night, negotiated to RM50 for long-stay), food (RM40/day average), beer (RM30/day average), Grab rides (RM20/day), miscellaneous (RM200/week) -- totalled roughly RM5,500 a month. That left RM2,500 surplus. Per month. For the first time in his adult life, Connor would be saving money. Not the theoretical saving of someone who says "I should save" while spending -- the actual, mathematical saving of income exceeding expenditure.

He could stay in KL for six months. A year. He could get a proper apartment, leave the hostel, live like a local. He could stop asking his parents for money. He could stop the monthly deposit that came with the invisible weight of his mother's worry and his father's disappointment and his sister's silent judgement. He could be, for the first time, genuinely self-sufficient.

He could be what his Instagram said he was.

The thought was narcotic. It entered his bloodstream through the eyes -- the vision of himself as the man he performed -- and it moved through him with the warm, spreading ease of something designed to feel good and engineered to destroy.

He pulled out his phone. Opened Instagram. His last post -- the rooftop selfie from three days ago, Petronas Towers behind him, caption: *Office for the day. Your 9-5 could never.* -- had 52 likes. He scrolled through his feed: other nomads in Bali, Lisbon, Chiang Mai, Medellín. They all looked the same. They all claimed the same freedom. But Connor knew -- he knew with the certainty of a man who checks his bank balance at 2 AM -- that most of them were funded by parents, or credit cards, or the slow erosion of savings that would eventually pull them home.

He could be different. He could be the one who actually made it work.

The hesitation was still there, somewhere, a pebble in his shoe. He shifted his weight and it moved, and then it was in a different place, still there but differently uncomfortable, and he decided it was the chair and not the pebble and stood up and went downstairs.

---

The communal kitchen at half past seven was Mama Siti's kingdom.

She stood at the stove -- an ancient two-burner that should have been condemned during the Mahathir administration -- stirring a pot of curry with a wooden spoon the length of her forearm. The spoon was dark with decades of turmeric staining, smooth with use, and Mama Siti wielded it with an authority that suggested the spoon had opinions and she was the only person who could translate them.

She wore her uniform: a cotton baju kurung in faded blue, a white headscarf pinned with pragmatic indifference, and the expression she always wore, which was the expression of a woman who had been watching people eat her food for longer than most of them had been alive and had formed conclusions about the human race that she kept to herself.

Connor entered. Sat at the counter. The nasi lemak appeared.

"Selamat pagi, Mama."

She didn't respond. She'd stopped responding to Connor's attempts at Malay on day four, when he'd asked for "nasi goreng pedas" and pronounced it in a way that somehow sounded like a request for her grandmother's undergarments. She simply placed the banana leaf in front of him -- rice, sambal, egg, anchovies, peanuts, a slice of cucumber -- and returned to her pot.

Connor ate with his fingers. He'd become good at this -- the technique of compacting the rice with the fingertips, adding sambal, scooping to the mouth. The first time he'd tried, he'd gotten rice on his chin, his shirt, the counter, and an adjacent backpacker. Now he ate with something approaching grace, and the eating was a small ritual that connected him to the building, to the kitchen, to the morning, in a way that his Instagram posts about "authentic cultural immersion" never quite captured because the posts were about the image and the eating was about the thing itself.

"Mama," he said, between bites. "You ever think about money?"

She looked at him. The wooden spoon paused mid-stir.

"Money?" she said, as though the word was a variety of insect that had landed on her counter.

"Like, what would you do if someone offered you really good money for easy work? Would you take it?"

Mama Siti stirred. The curry bubbled. From the pot rose the smell of coconut milk and lemongrass and galangal, and beneath it, the deeper, darker smell of spice paste that had been ground by hand on a batu lesung that Mama Siti kept under the counter like a weapon.

"*Siapa makan cabai, dialah rasa pedas,*" she said.

Connor waited. Mama Siti did not translate. She never translated. The proverbs arrived in Malay and stayed in Malay, and if you wanted to understand them you could learn the language, and if you didn't want to learn the language, the proverbs would wait. They'd been waiting for centuries.

"Right," Connor said. "Cheers, Mama."

He finished his nasi lemak. Left a ten-ringgit note on the counter -- double the usual, because the extra money from Felix's deliveries had already changed the way he spent. The ten vanished. Mama Siti did not acknowledge the tip. She stirred her pot and spoke to it quietly in Malay, and the pot listened, which was more than the boy had done.

The proverb she'd spoken -- *Siapa makan cabai, dialah rasa pedas* -- meant: *He who eats the chilli is the one who feels the heat.*

Connor would never look it up.

---

He found Priya in the common room at nine, cross-legged in the armchair, her Lonely Planet open on her lap. She was wearing a white cotton T-shirt and denim shorts and her round glasses, and her hair was braided over one shoulder, and she was reading with the focused absorption of someone who believed that understanding the place you were in was not optional.

"Morning, babe."

She looked up. Smiled. Not the full smile -- the careful one, the one that had been recalibrated since their argument about the packages two days ago. The crack between them had been painted over but not repaired, and both of them could feel the paint.

"You were up early," she said. "I heard the door."

"Felix wanted to chat. Business stuff."

The word *business* crossed the space between them and landed at Priya's feet like something she hadn't ordered. She looked at it. She looked at Connor. She adjusted her glasses.

"What kind of business stuff?"

"Just the import-export thing. He wants me to do more regular work. Better pay."

"More deliveries."

"Regular deliveries. A proper schedule. Like a job."

Priya closed the Lonely Planet. The rubber bands snapped softly against the cover. She placed both hands flat on the book and looked at Connor with the expression he'd learned to recognise as her diagnostic face -- the face she wore when a patient presented symptoms they were trying to hide.

"Connor, can I tell you something without you getting defensive?"

"I'm never defensive."

"You're always defensive."

"That's a bit defensive of you to say."

She didn't laugh. This was bad. Priya's failure to laugh at his deflections was the barometric pressure drop before a storm.

"The more you work for Felix, the more you depend on Felix. The more you depend on Felix, the harder it is to stop. Do you see that? It's a pattern. It's -- in medicine, we'd call it a dependency loop. The treatment creates the condition that requires more treatment."

"Right, so Felix is a disease. Great. That's a really supportive thing to say about my mate."

"He's not your mate, Connor. He's your employer. And you don't know what he's employing you to do."

The sentence was precise and cold and it hit the wall of Connor's defences and left a small crack -- smaller than the one between them, but there. He felt it. For one suspended moment, the arithmetic dissolved and the question beneath it surfaced: *What am I carrying?*

He met her eyes. She was looking at him the way she looked at everything -- carefully, completely, with the full weight of her attention -- and he understood that she was not arguing with him. She was trying to save him. The realisation was uncomfortable because it implied he needed saving, and Connor Briggs did not need saving. Connor Briggs was fine. Connor Briggs had been travelling for four years and had never once needed saving.

"I know what I'm doing," he said.

She held his gaze for three full seconds -- counting, he could almost see her counting, the way doctors count before delivering results -- and then she looked down at the Lonely Planet and opened it and said, "Okay."

Not agreement. Not acceptance. Just the sound of a hand withdrawing.

Connor stood. "I'm going to Grind Culture. Coming?"

"No. I want to visit the Islamic Arts Museum. I've been meaning to go all week."

"Cool. Have fun."

He walked to the door. At the threshold, he stopped. Turned. She was reading -- or performing reading, her eyes moving across the page at a speed that suggested comprehension but her posture rigid, angled toward the door, listening to his footsteps fade.

"Priya."

She looked up.

"It's just logistics. Moving things from A to B. That's all it is."

She pushed her glasses up. "Okay, Connor."

He left. The word *okay* followed him down the staircase and out the front door and into the morning heat of Petaling Street, where the sun hit the pavement like a physical force and the air smelled of fried dough and diesel and the beginning of something that could not be undone.

---

Grind Culture was the café where Connor went to be a digital nomad.

It was on a side street off Jalan Sultan, a narrow shophouse that had been converted with the usual formula: exposed brick, Edison bulbs, a chalkboard menu with pour-over options no one ordered, a barista with a man-bun and an expression of cultivated boredom. The Wi-Fi was fast. The coffee was expensive. The clientele was a mixture of actual remote workers and people like Connor, who sat with laptops open and the appearance of productivity while doing exactly nothing.

He ordered his flat white -- RM14, which he no longer winced at -- and sat at his usual table by the window, the one that got good light for laptop selfies. He opened his MacBook. He opened a browser. He opened the Pacific Soul Retreats Instagram account, which he nominally managed, and spent seven minutes choosing between two nearly identical sunset photos for the Thursday post.

Then he opened a new tab and typed: *import export jobs kuala lumpur salary*

Google delivered. He scrolled through results: logistics coordinator, RM3,000-5,000/month. Supply chain analyst, RM4,000-7,000. Import clerk, RM2,500. The numbers confirmed what Felix had told him -- RM8,000 a month for courier work was high but not impossible, not insane, not the kind of figure that should trigger alarm bells. It was the upper end of logistics work. That was all.

He did not Google *drug trafficking penalties malaysia*.

He did not Google *backpacker drug mule southeast asia*.

He did not Google *signs you are being recruited as a drug courier*.

These searches would have taken seconds. They would have returned thousands of results -- news articles, embassy warnings, survivor testimonials, legal explainers, the Dangerous Drugs Act itself in full searchable text, with Section 39B highlighted in the red of a stop sign. The information was there, abundant, free, a wall of evidence standing between Connor and the decision he was about to make.

He did not look. He never looked. Looking was what careful people did, and careful people were the people who went home and got jobs and stopped travelling and became the people Connor pitied from the window of a café in a city they'd never visit.

He closed the tab. Opened Instagram. Posted the sunset photo for Pacific Soul. Caption: *Find your light.* Scheduled for 6 PM EST.

Then he texted Felix.

*I'm in. When do I start?*

The reply came in eleven seconds.

*Tomorrow. I'll set up the schedule tonight. Welcome aboard, Connor.*

A second message, two seconds later:

*This is going to change everything.*

Connor read it and smiled and felt the smile all the way down, through his chest and into his stomach where the hesitation had been sitting, and the smile was so wide and so warm that it buried the hesitation entirely, the way sunlight buries a shadow, the way noise buries a warning, the way the person you want to be buries the person you are.

He ordered a second flat white. He sat in the window of Grind Culture and watched Petaling Street move in its daily rhythm -- the tourists, the vendors, the old man with the bird cages, the motorcycle couriers threading between cars -- and he thought about RM2,000 a week and what it would feel like to not need his parents' money and what it would feel like to be free.

He did not think about what he would carry or where it came from or where it went or why it needed to move by hand through the streets of a city that killed people for moving certain things.

The flat white was good. The Wi-Fi was strong. The sun came through the window and made his laptop screen glow and he felt, with a certainty that had no evidence beneath it, that he had made the right decision.

---

Felix's schedule arrived at eleven PM, delivered in person.

Connor was in Bed 7, scrolling his phone, the blue light of the screen the only illumination in the dorm besides the ambient glow from the air well. The French backpacker above him was asleep, breathing with the congested regularity of a man whose sinuses had not adjusted to the tropics. Two beds down, a Korean girl was listening to something through earbuds, her face green-lit by her phone. The ceiling fan turned. The hostel breathed.

Three raps on the dorm door. Soft. The particular softness of a knock designed to wake one person without disturbing others.

Connor padded to the door in his board shorts. Felix was in the hallway, leaning against the wall with the easy posture of someone who had been waiting and didn't mind waiting, the way cats don't mind waiting because the waiting is part of the hunt.

"Walk with me," Felix said.

They went to the air well. The internal courtyard was small -- four metres square, open to the sky, the walls rising around it like a well shaft. During the day, light fell straight down and lit the mosaic tile bench and the potted plants and the small patch of ground where nothing grew because nothing had grown there since the building was built. At night, the air well was a column of dark air connecting the hostel's floors, and if you stood at the bottom and looked up, you could see a rectangle of sky framed by the building's walls, and sometimes stars, and sometimes the running lights of a plane descending toward KLIA.

No stars tonight. Just the orange ambient light of the city reflected off low cloud, and the hum, and the smell -- the hostel's nighttime smell of damp wood and mosquito coil and the ghost of Mama Siti's evening curry.

Felix produced a folded piece of paper from his shirt pocket. White, A4, creased into thirds. He unfolded it and held it so the glow from the second-floor hallway light fell across the surface. Connor leaned in.

It was a table. Handwritten, in Felix's precise European script. Days of the week across the top. Rows beneath: times, addresses, contact names.

Monday -- 10:00 -- Jalan Ipoh 47, Mr. Tan
Tuesday -- 14:00 -- Brickfields, Lorong 3, "Blue Door"
Wednesday -- REST
Thursday -- 11:00 -- Chow Kit, Jalan Raja Bot 12, Auntie Lim
Friday -- 10:00 -- Jalan Ipoh 47, Mr. Tan (return)
Saturday -- 16:00 -- Bukit Bintang, Lot 22B, ground floor, ask for Danny
Sunday -- REST

"Six drops a week, two rest days," Felix said. "You pick up from me or from Wei's shop, depending on the day. I'll text you each morning with the specifics. The items vary -- sometimes a package, sometimes an envelope, sometimes a backpack. You don't open them. You don't discuss them. You deliver, you collect confirmation -- usually a handshake or a nod -- and you leave."

Connor studied the schedule. The locations were spread across KL -- Jalan Ipoh to the north, Brickfields to the south, Chow Kit to the northeast, Bukit Bintang central. A geography of drops that covered the city like a net. Each location was a place he'd been to or passed through, ordinary streets in ordinary neighborhoods, the kind of places where a backpacker with a daypack would be invisible.

"Pay is weekly," Felix continued. "RM2,000, transferred to your account every Sunday night. If a job gets cancelled -- rain, schedule change, whatever -- you still get the base rate. Think of it as a salary."

A salary. The word landed like a key in a lock, the tumbler turning, the door opening onto a room Connor had wanted to enter since the day he dropped out of university. A salary meant legitimacy. A salary meant he was working, earning, contributing. A salary meant the next time his mother asked "What are you doing over there, Connor?" he would have an answer that didn't require creative editing.

"What about the items?" Connor asked. The question surprised him -- it emerged from the space where the hesitation had been, a small survivor clinging to a piece of wreckage. "Like, if someone asks me what I'm carrying--"

"Nobody asks. You're a tourist with a bag. But if someone asks, you're carrying gifts for a friend. Or supplies for a business. Or your own things. Nobody looks twice at a backpacker."

"Right."

"One more thing." Felix's voice changed register -- not louder, not harder, but more focused, the way a spotlight narrows. "This stays between us. Completely. Not Priya, not Jake, not the hostel staff. Nobody. The people I work with value discretion above everything else. If word gets out that I'm running a logistics operation from this hostel, the landlord shuts it down. Razak shuts it down. Immigration gets involved. It's bad for everyone."

"Yeah, no. Of course. I'm not going to--"

"I know you won't." Felix folded the paper and handed it to Connor. "Keep this somewhere safe. Don't photograph it. Don't put it in your phone."

Connor took the paper. It was warm from Felix's pocket, the folds sharp and deliberate. He held it the way you hold a ticket -- a ticket to somewhere better, somewhere the bank balance didn't fall and the parents' deposit wasn't needed and the Instagram posts weren't lies.

"Starting tomorrow," Felix said. "Monday. Jalan Ipoh. I'll have the package ready by nine. Meet me in my room."

"Done."

They stood in the air well. Above them, the rectangle of sky was orange and starless and alive with the reflected glow of eight million people going about the business of a city that did not know or care that a twenty-seven-year-old Australian had just agreed to carry things he'd never opened for people he'd never met to places he'd never questioned, on a schedule written by a man whose real name might not be Felix Decker.

"One more thing," Felix said.

He reached into his pocket and produced a phone. Not his phone -- a different one. Small, cheap, a Samsung with a cracked case and a prepaid SIM. He handed it to Connor.

"Work phone. I'll text you on this. Keep it charged, keep it on you. Don't use it for anything personal. No Instagram, no calls to Mum. This is for business only."

Connor held the phone. It was light in his hand, anonymous, the kind of phone that was sold in plastic blister packs at 7-Eleven for RM80. A burner. The word appeared in his mind, surfacing from the reservoir of crime dramas and true-crime podcasts he'd consumed over the years. A burner phone.

The hesitation made one last attempt. It rose from wherever it had been pressed, broke through the surface of his thoughts, and formed a sentence: *Legitimate businesses don't give you burner phones.*

He looked at the phone. He looked at Felix. Felix was watching him with the same expression he always wore when Connor was on the edge of a question -- patient, calm, faintly amused, as if watching a child puzzle over something simple.

"Standard practice," Felix said. "The company uses prepaid phones for all field staff. It's a liability thing. Corporate policy."

The sentence was absurd. The sentence was so transparently, obviously absurd that any person paying the slightest attention would have laughed. Corporate policy. For a logistics company that operated out of a Chinatown hostel and a phone repair shop and paid cash. Corporate policy.

Connor put the phone in his pocket.

"Cool," he said. "Makes sense."

And that was the moment. Not the moment when he'd agreed, not the moment when he'd texted *I'm in*, not the moment when he'd looked at the schedule and felt the key turn in the lock. This was the moment. The pocket. The phone. The weight of it against his thigh, small and warm and cheap, the weight of a second life he was choosing to carry without examining, the way he'd carried every package without examining, the way he'd carried Felix's friendship without examining, the way he'd carried himself through the world for twenty-seven years without examining any of it.

The phone was in his pocket and the paper was in his hand and Felix was smiling and the air well was dark and somewhere above them, in the rectangle of sky, a plane was descending toward KLIA, its lights blinking, carrying someone new to the city -- a new arrival, a new guest, a new body to fill a bed in a hostel that had been filling beds and emptying them for nearly a century.

"Get some sleep," Felix said. "Big day tomorrow."

He turned and climbed the staircase. Second floor, third floor, the third step not squeaking. His door closed. The corridor was silent.

Connor stood in the air well alone. The mosaic tiles were cold under his bare feet. The sulfurous breath of the building's drains rose from somewhere below, mixing with the faint smell of Mama Siti's curry from the kitchen, left to cool in a pot on the stove, spiced and ancient and indifferent. He looked up. The orange sky looked back. From somewhere on the second floor, the Korean girl's music -- a high, sweet voice singing in a language he didn't understand about something he would never know.

He went back to Bed 7. He folded the schedule and tucked it into the inner pocket of his daypack, the zippered compartment where he kept his passport and emergency cash and the blue Sea to Summit towel that had been with him through twelve countries and would be with him at the end.

He placed the burner phone on the mattress beside his regular phone. Two screens. Two lives. The old phone -- cracked, sticker-covered, 4,200 followers, his mother's contact, his sister's silence, the Pacific Soul Retreats account, the Instagram grid of a life performed. The new phone -- clean, anonymous, no contacts except one, no history, no followers, no identity. A blank screen waiting to be filled with work he would not question, for money he would not trace, from a man he would not doubt.

He lay in the dark and listened to the building settle -- the wood expanding and contracting with the temperature, the pipes groaning, the ceiling fan's metronomic *tick, tick, tick*. Somewhere below, a door opened and closed. Somewhere above, Felix's floorboards creaked as he paced his private room, doing whatever Felix did at midnight, which Connor had never wondered about and wasn't going to start wondering about now.

*RM2,000 a week,* he thought. *She'll be right.*

He fell asleep with both phones on the mattress beside him, one in each hand, the digital nomad and the courier, the person he showed the world and the person he was becoming, both warm, both humming faintly with the electromagnetic life of their circuits, both connected to networks that stretched across the city and beyond, one visible and one invisible, one counting likes and one counting something else entirely.

In the morning, the call to prayer would come at 5:32, and Connor would not hear it, and the city would ask its question -- *are you awake, are you listening, do you know where you are* -- and Connor would not answer, because Connor was not listening, and he did not know where he was, and the knowing, by now, was already too late to help.

But morning was hours away. Now there was only the dark, and the fan, and the two phones, and the building breathing around him like something patient and very old, and the name on the bed frame -- L-E-N-A -- five letters carved into wood by a girl who had slept in this exact spot and carried packages for this exact man and was now in a place where the fluorescent lights never turned off and the doors did not open from the inside.

Connor slept. The building didn't.
