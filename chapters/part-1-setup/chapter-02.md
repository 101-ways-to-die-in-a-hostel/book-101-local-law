# Chapter 2: The German

The beer was cold and it was free and that was enough for Connor Briggs.

He took the bottle without hesitation -- a Tiger, sweating in the heat, its label already peeling -- and dropped himself into the nearest chair in the common room of The Lantern Hostel like a man arriving at a party that had been waiting for him. The European who'd handed it to him was still standing, one arm resting on the back of an adjacent chair, watching Connor with an expression of mild, unreadable amusement.

"Cheers, mate," Connor said, and took a long pull. The beer was crisp and bitter and exactly what he needed after a day of cheap flights and cheaper trains and hauling his pack through the wet furnace of Kuala Lumpur's streets. He let the cold settle in his chest and looked around the common room.

It was a good room. The red paper lanterns -- dozens of them, strung across the ceiling on wires that sagged in the humidity -- threw a warm amber light over everything, softening the mismatched furniture, the battered bookshelf stuffed with abandoned novels in six languages, the TV mounted on the wall playing CNN with the sound off. Two ceiling fans rotated overhead in that slow, thoughtful way that ceiling fans have in the tropics, as if they'd long ago accepted that the heat would win and were just going through the motions. The tile floor was cool underfoot, the old encaustic pattern cracked and uneven, and the air smelled of cooking oil and Tiger Balm and the faintly sweet rot of old wood in a wet climate. Through the central air well -- that strange open shaft in the building's core -- Connor could hear motorbikes on Petaling Street, the thump of bass from the clubs on Changkat, a cat screaming at something in the alley. The sounds came down the air well amplified and distorted, as if the building were cupping its hand around its ear.

*This is the vibe,* Connor thought. *This is what travel looks like.*

"You just arrived today?" the European said.

Connor looked at him properly for the first time. The man was tall and lean, maybe early thirties, with the kind of angular face that belonged on the cover of a men's travel magazine -- sharp jaw, close-cropped dark hair, cheekbones you could slice cheese on. He was dressed in a clean linen shirt, untucked, with well-fitted shorts and leather sandals that looked like they cost more than Connor's entire backpack. There was a thin scar through his left eyebrow, a pale line that caught the lantern light when he tilted his head. He didn't look like a backpacker. He looked like someone who'd been cast to play a backpacker in a European art film.

"Yeah, flew in from Bali this arvo," Connor said. "AirAsia. Absolute cattle class, but you can't beat fifty bucks."

"From Bali," the man repeated, and smiled. It was a good smile -- warm, unhurried, like he had nowhere to be and nothing to do except hear about Connor's day. "How was it?"

"Bali? Yeah, it was sick. Did Seminyak for a bit, then Canggu. Got the tattoo topped up." Connor pulled up his left sleeve to show the compass on his inner forearm, the lines faded to blue-grey from sun and salt water. "The surf was going off. You been?"

"Twice," the man said. He sat down across from Connor, crossing one leg over the other with the ease of someone who was always comfortable. "But I preferred Siargao. In the Philippines. The surf is better and the tourists haven't found it yet." He paused. "Well. They're finding it now."

"Siargao," Connor said, filing it away. He didn't know where it was, exactly, but he'd look it up later. Or not. The name was enough -- he could drop it in conversation, on Instagram, the way you collected stamps. *Been meaning to hit Siargao. Mate of mine says the surf is unreal.* "Mate, I haven't even asked -- what's your name?"

"Felix," the man said. "Felix Decker."

He extended his hand and Connor shook it. The grip was firm, dry, precise -- the handshake of a man who'd practiced it.

"Connor. Connor Briggs. From Melbourne."

"Melbourne," Felix said, as if this was interesting. "A great city. I spent a month there in 2019. Fitzroy. The coffee is exceptional."

"Fitzroy! Legend. That's basically my neighbourhood. Well, Hawthorn, but close enough." It wasn't close enough, geographically or culturally, but Connor had learned to blur the distinction. "Where are you from?"

"Hamburg. Germany."

"No way. I love Germans. Every hostel I've been in, you guys are there. Efficient, you know? Always got the best gear." Connor grinned and gestured at Felix's outfit. "Case in point."

Felix laughed -- a short, clean sound, like the closing of a well-made door. "We do take our packing seriously." He tilted his Tiger towards Connor. "Welcome to The Lantern. It's a good place."

"Yeah? How long have you been here?"

"Two months."

Connor's bottle paused halfway to his mouth. "Two months? In a hostel? In KL?"

"KL has layers," Felix said. He held Connor's gaze for a beat longer than was strictly normal. "Most travelers pass through in three days. See the Towers, eat at Jalan Alor, take a selfie at Batu Caves, move on. They never get past the surface."

"And you're past the surface?"

"I'm a photographer," Felix said. "I need time. I need to understand a place before I can photograph it properly." He shrugged one shoulder, an elegant continental gesture. "So I stay. I watch. I learn."

*A photographer,* Connor thought. That explained the polish, the confidence, the sense that Felix was always composing a frame. Connor understood people in creative fields. He was, after all, basically in a creative field himself. Social media consulting was a creative pursuit. It was. He'd told people that enough times that it was true.

"That's sick," Connor said. "What kind of photography?"

"Documentary, mostly. Remote villages. Markets. The human infrastructure of places tourists don't see." Felix took a measured sip of his beer. "I spent three months in Myanmar last year, in the hills north of Mandalay. Villages that don't appear on any map. The people there have never seen a smartphone." He smiled at a private memory. "It was extraordinary."

"Mate. That sounds unreal."

"It was. I have a photo of a Shan woman, ninety years old, her face tattooed in the traditional way, and she's laughing at something her granddaughter said. It's the best photo I've ever taken." Felix shook his head. "Probably the best photo I'll ever take."

Connor believed every word of it. The story had texture, specifics, the Shan woman's tattooed face and the granddaughter's joke and the hills north of Mandalay. It sounded true because it sounded lived. What Connor couldn't hear -- what he had no ear for -- was the polish. The way the story's beats landed with the precision of a comedian's set, each detail chosen for maximum effect, the pause before the final line calibrated to make it feel spontaneous. Felix told stories the way a watchmaker assembled movements: every gear in place, every spring under tension, and the whole mechanism invisible behind the face.

"So what do you do, Connor?" Felix asked. He leaned forward slightly, elbows on knees. The posture said: *I'm genuinely interested.*

This was the part Connor liked. He had the spiel down cold.

"I'm a digital nomad," he said. "Location independent. Social media consulting, mostly -- I help brands with their online presence, content strategy, that kind of thing. The beauty of it is I can work from anywhere, right? All I need is a laptop and wifi." He took a swig of Tiger. "I've been doing it for four years now. Since I dropped out of uni. Best decision I ever made."

"Impressive," Felix said. "And your clients are--?"

"Global," Connor said, which was technically true if you counted a yoga studio in Northcote, Melbourne, that paid him one hundred and fifty dollars a month to run their Instagram. "I've got a few regulars and then I pick up freelance stuff as I go. It's not about the money, though, you know? It's about the freedom. The experiences."

Felix nodded slowly, as if he were absorbing something profound. "I understand that. The freedom. It's why I do what I do, too." He held up his bottle. "To freedom, then."

They clinked bottles. The sound was small and bright in the warm room.

"Speaking of," Felix said, "are you hungry? The cook here -- Mama Siti -- she makes the best nasi lemak in Chinatown. Five ringgit. An absolute steal."

"I could eat."

"I'll get us two plates." Felix stood, and Connor watched him walk to the kitchen counter with the loose, unhurried stride of a man who owned the space he moved through. He spoke to the ancient woman behind the counter in what sounded like Malay -- fluid, easy, nothing like a tourist reading from a phrasebook. The old woman, small and hunched and wrapped in a headscarf that made her look like a cloth doll, peered up at Felix with dark eyes that seemed to be measuring something behind his face. She ladled rice and sambal and anchovies onto two plates without smiling.

*He speaks Malay,* Connor thought. *Two months here and he speaks the language. That's commitment.* It didn't occur to Connor to wonder why a German travel photographer would invest that heavily in a place he was only passing through. It didn't occur to him to wonder about any of it. Felix was interesting, generous, and cool, and Connor liked interesting, generous, cool people. That was the beginning and end of his assessment.

Felix returned with two plates of nasi lemak, the coconut rice fragrant and steaming, flanked by crispy anchovies, roasted peanuts, half a boiled egg, a cucumber slice, and a devastating red sambal that smelled of chillies and dried shrimp and something darker beneath. He set one plate in front of Connor and sat back down.

"Enjoy."

Connor ate. It was incredible -- the coconut rice rich and nutty, the sambal nuclear, the anchovies shattering between his teeth. The flavours were layered and complex in a way that made him want to photograph the plate and immediately felt inadequate to describe it.

"This is unreal," he said, mouth full.

"Mama Siti has been cooking since before this building was a hostel," Felix said. "Since before it was a brothel, if you believe Uncle Razak."

"A brothel?"

"The building has had many lives. Warehouse, brothel, gambling den. Japanese headquarters during the war." Felix ate neatly, precisely, his fork and spoon working in the Malaysian style. "The walls remember everything."

Connor looked at the walls. Peeling paint, faded plaster, the ghosts of old signage in Chinese characters. The red lanterns hung from wires like paper organs, pulsing gently in the current from the ceiling fans. He could almost believe it -- that the building was alive, that it remembered. Almost. Then he took another bite of nasi lemak and the thought dissolved in sambal.

---

The American arrived like a weather event.

"Dude. DUDE. Is this the common room? This is sick. This is, like, the sickest common room I've ever been in. Are those real lanterns? Are they, like, actual paper? Can I touch one?"

He was stocky, sunburned to a shade of aggressive pink, wearing a backwards cap over sandy hair, a surf brand t-shirt two sizes too small, and the permanent grin of a golden retriever who'd just discovered a tennis ball factory. He stood in the doorway of the common room with a beer in one hand and the other extended towards the nearest lantern, fingers reaching.

"I wouldn't," Felix said mildly. "They're old. And flammable."

"Right. Right, right, right. Smart." The American retracted his hand and turned his grin on Connor and Felix. "Hey, I'm Jake. Jake Porter. San Diego."

"Connor. Melbourne."

"No way! Australia? Dude, I love Australians. You guys are, like, the Americans of the Southern Hemisphere."

Connor wasn't sure this was a compliment, but he liked Jake immediately. There was something disarmingly guileless about him -- his enthusiasm was too large and too unqualified to be anything but real. He was the human equivalent of a labrador: loyal, eager, absolutely no idea what was going on.

"Pull up a chair, mate," Connor said. "The German here is buying."

Felix smiled. "I'm Felix. And apparently I'm buying."

"Dude, a German! No way. My roommate at SDSU was German. Klaus. Crazy dude. Used to drink beer for breakfast." Jake dropped into a chair, which protested audibly. "Not, like, in a bad way. In a German way."

"We do have a reputation," Felix said, and the warmth in his voice was exactly right -- amused but not condescending, welcoming the new addition without seeming to try. He reached behind his chair and produced another Tiger from a plastic bag Connor hadn't noticed. The bag had at least six more in it. "Beer?"

"Dude. Yes. Thank you." Jake cracked it open with practiced ease. "So what's the deal with this place? How long have you guys been here?"

"I arrived today," Connor said.

"Two months," Felix said.

Jake's eyes went wide. "Two months? In a hostel? Dude, that's, like--"

"Commitment," Connor offered.

"I was going to say nuts, but sure. Commitment." Jake drank. "I've been in KL for, like, four days? Five? I don't know. What day is it?"

"Wednesday," Felix said.

"Cool. Cool cool cool. Is it, though? I feel like it's Thursday. Whatever. Days are just, like, labels, right? Social constructs."

"Profound," Felix said, and Connor caught the faintest flicker of something in his eyes -- not contempt, exactly, but assessment. A quick, surgical look, the kind a mechanic gives an engine before deciding if it's worth fixing. Then it was gone, replaced by the warm smile, and Felix was pouring Jake another beer from a fresh bottle before Jake's first was half empty.

They talked. The conversation followed the predictable hostel trajectory -- where are you from, where have you been, where are you going -- the same catechism repeated in common rooms across Southeast Asia, a liturgy of itineraries and recommendations and "oh you HAVE to go to" that served less as information exchange and more as mutual verification of tribal membership. *We are travelers. We are the same. We belong here.*

Jake was twenty-four, from San Diego, "taking a year off" after college. When Connor asked what he'd studied, Jake said "business" with the cheerful indifference of a man who'd already forgotten. The year off had been two years now, a fact Jake volunteered without embarrassment. He'd been to Thailand ("insane"), Vietnam ("also insane"), Indonesia ("bro, INSANE"), and was now "just vibing" his way through Malaysia before heading to -- he paused to think -- "wherever, dude. I don't plan."

"A man after my own heart," Connor said.

"Yeah, dude! Plans are, like -- plans are for people who are afraid of life, you know?"

Connor knew. He'd said the same thing a hundred times, in a hundred common rooms, and every time he said it he believed it slightly more and the truth receded slightly further. The truth being: he didn't plan because planning required admitting he didn't know what he was doing. But here, in the red lantern glow of a hostel common room, surrounded by people who'd made the same choice, the absence of a plan felt like liberation rather than deficit.

Other travelers drifted through the common room as the night deepened. A French couple arguing softly about Penang. A solo Korean woman reading *Sapiens* on a beanbag. Two British lads comparing Tinder matches. The hostel at night was a living thing -- bodies flowing in and out, conversations starting and ending and merging, the communal kitchen clanging as someone boiled ramen, a phone playing lo-fi beats from a shelf. The red lanterns swayed in the draft from the air well, and the ceiling fans rotated, and the tile floor was cool, and it was, Connor thought, exactly the kind of place he'd been looking for without knowing he was looking.

Felix moved through it all like a host. He seemed to know everyone -- greeting the French couple by name, asking the Korean woman about her book, trading a joke in halting French with one of the British lads. He was generous with the beers, pulling them from his seemingly bottomless plastic bag, always cold, always offered before you realized you wanted one. His stories were perfect: a street food crawl in Penang that nearly ended in a fistfight over the best char kway teow, a sunrise hike in the Cameron Highlands with a group of monks, a near-miss with a monitor lizard while kayaking in Langkawi. Each story was specific and vivid and landed with a punchline, and each one ended with Felix turning the conversation back to someone else. "But tell me about your trip. Where have you been?"

He was, Connor decided, the best kind of traveler. The kind who'd seen everything and wasn't a wanker about it.

"This bloke's been everywhere," Connor told Jake, thumbing towards Felix. "Myanmar, Philippines, the lot."

"Dude. That's sick. I want to do Myanmar but like, isn't it, like -- heavy there right now?"

"It's complicated," Felix said. "But the people are extraordinary. The most generous people I've ever met." He smiled. "And the beer is cheap."

"That's all I need to know, dude."

Connor laughed. Jake was an idiot, but he was the right kind of idiot -- uncomplicated, enthusiastic, safe. He was the kind of mate you wanted at a party: would never steal your drink, would always laugh at your jokes, and would never, under any circumstances, ask you a hard question. Connor collected people like Jake the way some people collected stamps -- quickly, casually, and without bothering to learn their real value.

---

Sometime after eleven, when the French couple had gone to bed and the British lads had headed to Changkat and the common room had thinned to its late-night residents, Felix looked at Connor and Jake and said, "Rooftop?"

They climbed the narrow staircase single-file, the old wooden steps groaning under their weight. The staircase was barely wide enough for one person -- Connor's shoulders nearly touched both walls -- and the air grew warmer as they ascended, the building holding its heat like a clay oven. On the second-floor landing, Connor caught a glimpse of Japanese characters showing through the peeling paint, faded military signage from the occupation era, and felt a small chill that he immediately dismissed as a draft from the air well.

The third floor was quieter, darker. Two doors on the right -- dorms -- and two on the left. One of the left-hand doors was open a crack, revealing a room barely larger than a closet, but with a real bed, a nightstand, a reading lamp. A private room. Felix's door, Connor assumed, because Felix paused there for a moment and reached inside to grab something -- another bag of beers -- before closing the door and locking it with a key.

*A private room,* Connor noted. *In a hostel. For two months.*

The thought surfaced and sank without consequence, like a fish breaking the surface of a pond. It was odd, sure. Private rooms in hostels weren't cheap -- maybe RM85 a night, which over two months was... Connor didn't do the math because Connor didn't do math, but it was a lot. More than a travel photographer working on speculative documentary projects should be spending. But then Felix always seemed to have money, and some people just did, and Connor wasn't the kind of person who questioned other people's finances because that would invite questions about his own.

The rooftop was a revelation.

They emerged through a fire door propped open with a brick and stepped out onto a flat concrete terrace ringed by a low wall that was probably not up to code. Plastic chairs were scattered about in no discernible pattern, a clothesline stretched between two poles with someone's underwear and sarongs flapping in the night breeze, and there -- there, above the corrugated zinc rooftops of Chinatown, above the tangle of electrical wires that cross-hatched the sky like a mad architect's blueprints, above the dark mass of the Guan Di temple and the glowing neon of Petaling Street's shuttered market stalls -- there were the Petronas Towers.

They rose from the city like two silver syringes, lit from within, their faceted surfaces catching and refracting the light so that they seemed to pulse against the dark sky. The skybridge connecting them at the forty-first floor hung like a filament of light suspended between two columns of glass. Everything around them -- the office blocks, the construction cranes, the distant ridge of jungle-covered hills -- fell away into darkness, and the Towers stood alone, ridiculous and beautiful and utterly dominant, saying what they'd been built to say: *We are here. We are the future. Look at us.*

"Jesus," Connor breathed.

"That never gets old," Felix said. He'd already settled into a plastic chair and was opening beers with a Swiss Army knife he'd produced from his pocket. Always prepared, always equipped, always one step ahead of the moment. "Here."

Connor took the beer and sat down. Jake sat beside him, his mouth still open at the skyline.

"Dude. Those are the Petronas Towers."

"They are," Felix confirmed.

"I've seen pictures. But, like -- dude. They're RIGHT THERE."

"That's what I love about this rooftop," Felix said. "You're in Chinatown, which is ancient. Half these buildings are a hundred years old. And then you look up and there's the twenty-first century, right there." He took a sip. "Layers."

Connor drank and watched the Towers and felt something open in his chest -- not an emotion, exactly, but a kind of vindication. This was the moment. This was the shot. The rooftop terrace, the beers, the new mates, the Petronas Towers glittering against the Malaysian sky. This was the life that people back in Hawthorn, back in their cubicles and their mortgages and their Monday meetings, would never understand. He was living. Actually living.

He took out his phone and photographed the skyline. Then he photographed his beer with the Towers behind it. Then he adjusted the angle and took a selfie -- the three of them, Connor in the front, Felix behind his left shoulder, Jake behind his right, the Towers between them. He didn't post it yet. He'd find the right filter in the morning.

They talked. Jake dominated the first twenty minutes with a story about getting lost in Ho Chi Minh City that was approximately sixty percent digressions and forty percent "and then, dude, get this." Felix listened with what appeared to be genuine engagement, asking follow-up questions that made Jake feel like his story was interesting, which it was not. Connor marvelled at it -- at the patience, the generosity of attention. Most people would have glazed over three minutes into Jake's labyrinthine narration. Felix leaned in.

The night expanded around them. The heat softened to something bearable -- not cool, never cool, but the edge taken off by the breeze that moved across the rooftops, carrying the smell of char kway teow and diesel and jasmine from the temple below. The city sounds rose and fell -- a motorcycle accelerating on Jalan Sultan, the distant thrum of a club's bass line, a woman laughing in the apartment block across the street, the endless, irreducible hum of a city of eight million people settling into its evening.

Around midnight, Jake yawned. It was a yawn of magnificent proportions -- a full-body, eye-watering, jaw-cracking performance that seemed to temporarily dislocate his face.

"Dudes. I'm done. I'm, like, dead." He stood and nearly knocked over his chair. "What time is it? Midnight? Bro. That's, like, my bed time in San Diego. I mean, no it isn't. But tonight it is." He pointed at Connor. "You. Tomorrow. We're exploring. I saw a sign for like a bird park or something."

"The KL Bird Park," Felix said. "It's good."

"See? The German knows. Felix knows." Jake clasped Felix's hand in a complicated handshake that Felix navigated flawlessly. "Thanks for the beers, dude. You're a legend."

"Goodnight, Jake."

"Night, dudes. Night, Petronas." Jake waved at the Towers, then stumbled through the fire door and was gone, his footsteps descending the staircase in a series of creaks and thuds.

And then it was two.

---

The silence that followed Jake's departure was different. It had texture. Felix let it breathe for a while, sipping his beer, his eyes on the skyline, his face half-lit by the city's ambient glow. Without Jake's cheerful noise filling the space, Connor became aware of smaller sounds: the click of insects, the hum of an air conditioning unit somewhere below, the distant call to prayer from a mosque he couldn't see -- late, mournful, beautiful.

"He's a good guy," Felix said eventually.

"Jake? Yeah, he's a crack-up."

"Very American." Felix smiled. "Not much going on behind the eyes, but a good heart."

"That's harsh, mate."

"It's observation, not criticism. I like Jake. People like Jake are important. They keep things light." Felix turned the beer bottle slowly in his fingers. "But I don't think Jake is someone who wants more from travel than the surface. The photos, the parties, the 'I was there.' You know?"

Connor said nothing. He was aware that Felix was drawing a distinction -- between Jake and Connor, between surface travelers and something else -- and that the distinction was flattering to him.

"You're different," Felix said, as if reading the thought. "I could tell when we started talking. You're not just passing through. You're trying to understand something."

"Mate, I'm just winging it, to be honest."

"No. You're not." Felix looked at him. The scar on his eyebrow caught the light. "You dropped out of university to travel. You built a career around freedom. That takes courage. Most people talk about breaking free, but they never actually do it."

Connor felt something warm and unfamiliar move through him. It was the feeling of being seen -- not the Instagram version, not the curated feed, but the actual person underneath. Or at least, the person he wanted to believe was underneath.

"I just couldn't do the nine-to-five thing," Connor said. "I watched my dad go to work every day, come home tired, do it again. And for what? A house in the suburbs? A car? I wanted more than that."

"And you got more."

"I think so. Yeah."

Felix nodded slowly. "I understand that. When I left Hamburg, my family thought I was insane. A good German boy doesn't become a photographer. A good German boy studies engineering, gets a job at Siemens, marries a girl named Katrin, and buys a Volkswagen." He laughed softly. "My mother still asks when I'm coming home."

"Mine too," Connor said, and for a moment they were just two men on a rooftop in a city that wasn't home, bonding over the particular guilt of the runaway. It felt real. It probably was real, on some level -- the story about Felix's mother might even have been true. The best lies are built on foundations of truth, and Felix was a master architect.

"How do you afford it?" Connor asked. The beer had loosened his tongue. "Two months in a private room. All the beers. The travel. Photography doesn't pay that well, does it?"

Felix's expression didn't change, but something behind it shifted -- a door closing and another opening, so smoothly that you'd only notice if you were watching for it. Connor was not watching for it.

"It doesn't," Felix admitted. "Not the documentary work. That's for love, not money." He paused, seemed to consider something, then continued in a lower, more confidential tone. "But I've been in Southeast Asia for a long time. You learn how things work. How the economies really function. There are... opportunities that don't appear in any guidebook."

"What kind of opportunities?"

"Logistics, mostly. Helping people move things from one place to another. Connecting buyers with sellers. Import-export on a small scale." Felix waved a hand, as if these were trivial details. "Nothing glamorous. But it supplements the photography. And it means I can stay as long as I want, wherever I want."

Connor nodded. It made sense. Southeast Asia was full of hustles -- everyone he'd met was running some angle, from the tuk-tuk drivers in Bangkok to the surf instructors in Bali who sold weed on the side. Felix's version sounded cleaner, more professional, but the principle was the same: find the gap, fill it, get paid.

"Smart," Connor said.

"Practical," Felix corrected. "I prefer to think of it as practical." He drained his beer and set it down with a precise click on the concrete beside his chair. "And what about you, Connor? How's the social media consulting business?"

The question was asked without malice, but Connor heard the gears turning inside it. Felix already knew. He'd seen the way Connor had flinched, microscopic but visible, when the conversation turned to money. He'd noticed the old phone, the fraying board shorts, the way Connor had accepted the free beer with a gratitude that was just a shade too eager.

"Yeah, it's good," Connor said. "Ticking along."

"Good."

A silence. Connor drank. The Petronas Towers pulsed against the sky.

"Look," Felix said, "I'm going to say something, and you can absolutely say no. No pressure, no offence taken."

"Go for it."

"I could use someone reliable around here." Felix said it casually, almost as an afterthought, the way you'd mention that you'd seen a good restaurant down the street. "Just small stuff. Logistics. I've got the photography business -- the legitimate side -- and it needs occasional help. Runners. Someone to deliver prints, pick up equipment, that kind of thing. It's not full-time. A few hours a week. But it pays."

The offer hung in the warm night air between them. Below, a motorcycle growled through the alley. The clothesline flapped. The Petronas Towers watched from across the city, twin sentinels, indifferent and magnificent.

"How much?" Connor asked, and hated himself slightly for asking so quickly.

"Depends on the job. Two, three hundred ringgit per delivery. Sometimes more." Felix shrugged. "It adds up."

Two hundred ringgit was about sixty Australian dollars. For a delivery. Connor's freelance rate for a full month of Instagram management was a hundred and fifty dollars. The maths -- for once, the maths -- were clear.

"No offence," Connor said, "but I literally just met you."

"Of course." Felix held up his hands. "I'd be suspicious if you said yes immediately. Think about it. There's no deadline." He stood, smoothly, and collected both their empty bottles, his and Connor's, holding them loosely by the necks. Always cleaning up, Connor noticed. The common room earlier, the beer bottles, the nasi lemak plates -- Felix left no mess behind him. It was the tidiness of a man who was either deeply considerate or deeply careful, and Connor chose to read it as the former.

"I'm heading down," Felix said. "Long day tomorrow -- I've got a shoot in Brickfields." He tucked the bottles under one arm. "Think about what I said, Connor. No pressure."

"Yeah. Yeah, I will."

Felix smiled. "Goodnight, Connor."

"Night, mate."

He watched Felix cross the rooftop and disappear through the fire door, moving with that unhurried, confident stride. A moment later, Connor heard footsteps descending, then a door opening and closing on the third floor. The private room. Felix's private room, where he'd lived for two months, paying rates that would have drained Connor's bank account in a fortnight.

*How does he afford that?* Connor thought.

And then: *Maybe that's exactly what he's offering to show me.*

He sat alone on the rooftop for a while longer, finishing a beer that Felix had left open for him on the armrest of the adjacent chair. The man had known Connor would stay. He'd prepared for it. Connor didn't find this unsettling. He found it thoughtful.

The city murmured below. A siren in the middle distance, rising and falling. The bass from the clubs on Changkat had faded to a faint pulse, like a heartbeat. The Petronas Towers' lights shifted through some programmed cycle, blue to white to silver, and the skybridge between them glowed. The sky above KL was too polluted for stars, but the city made its own constellation -- a sprawl of light that went to every horizon, pulsing, alive.

*This could be something,* Connor thought. Not the delivery thing specifically, but the whole picture -- KL, the hostel, Felix's connections, a way to stay that didn't involve crawling home to Hawthorn with his tail between his legs. A life. The kind of life he posted about but hadn't quite achieved. The kind where the money flowed and the doors opened and every sunset was earned rather than stolen.

He stood, stretched, and headed for the fire door. The staircase groaned under him as he descended, third step from the top squeaking like it always did, like it had for a hundred years. Second floor. Dorm 3. He pushed the door open quietly.

The room was dark except for the blue glow of phone screens and a faint red light that filtered through the gap above the door -- the lanterns in the hallway, never extinguished, casting their warm arterial glow across the threshold. Eight bunks, most occupied. The breathing of strangers in the dark, the private sounds of sleep -- a murmur, a shift, the scratch of a hand against a sheet. The room smelled of insect repellent and sweat and the slightly sour scent of clothes that had been hand-washed in a sink and hung to dry in humidity that never let anything fully dry.

Connor climbed into Bed 7 -- lower bunk, against the wall, the one with the mattress that was thin enough to feel the wooden slats through the foam. He plugged in his phone and lay on his back, staring at the ceiling. The fan above him rotated in slow circles, click-click-clicking where one blade was slightly off balance, a metronome measuring out the night in irregular intervals.

His phone buzzed. He picked it up, squinting at the brightness.

A notification from his banking app. He tapped it, already knowing and dreading.

He stared at the number. Eight hundred and forty-seven dollars. His flights from Bali had cost four hundred. Hostel was thirty-five ringgit a night -- about twelve dollars -- but over a week that was eighty-four. Food. Transport. Beers. The number had been bigger when he'd last checked in Bali, but he hadn't checked carefully, because careful checking was a form of planning, and planning was for people who were afraid of life.

Eight forty-seven. His parents' next deposit wasn't for ten days. If he was careful -- genuinely careful, rice and instant noodles careful -- he could stretch it to three weeks. After that: the credit card, which was already carrying two thousand dollars he tried not to think about. After the credit card: phone calls. The kind of phone calls where you hear your father sigh before he speaks, and the sigh says more than the words that follow.

Or.

Two hundred ringgit per delivery. Sixty bucks. A few hours a week. Felix's offer, sitting there like a door left open.

Connor closed the banking app and opened Instagram instead. His latest post -- a photo of the Petaling Street night market stalls from that afternoon, captioned "KL, you absolute legend" -- had thirty-one likes. He scrolled through the comments. Three fire emojis, a "Living the dream bro" from a mate in Sydney, and a "Miss you xx" from a girl he'd met in Chiang Mai whose name he'd already forgotten.

Thirty-one likes. He told people he had about five thousand followers. He had 4,217. Close enough. The number hadn't moved in months.

He put his phone down and rolled onto his side. Through the thin wall, he could hear the air well amplifying the sounds of the city settling -- a last motorcycle, a dog barking, the rattle of a shutter being pulled down over a shop front. The ceiling fan clicked. Someone in a lower bunk muttered in their sleep, something in a language Connor didn't recognize.

He thought about Felix's smile on the rooftop. The easy confidence of it. The way he'd said "someone reliable" -- not "someone available" or "someone who needs cash," but "reliable." It was a word that meant something. It was a word that suggested Felix saw in Connor a quality that Connor wanted to believe he possessed. Reliable. Trustworthy. The kind of person you brought into your inner circle.

*She'll be right,* Connor thought. *It's just deliveries. Photography equipment. Prints. Felix is a photographer, it makes sense. And even if it's something else, so what? Everyone's got a hustle out here. That's how it works. That's how Asia works.*

He closed his eyes. The red glow of the hallway lantern filtered through the gap above the door, painting the inside of his eyelids a warm, shifting red. It pulsed there, rhythmic, alive, like the building itself was breathing, like the old shophouse was drawing air in through its central well and exhaling it out through its cracks and gaps and half-closed doors.

The last thought before sleep was not a thought but an image: Felix collecting the empty bottles on the rooftop, holding them loosely by the necks, carrying them away. A man who leaves no trace. A man who cleans up after himself.

Connor slept. The fan clicked. The lantern pulsed.

Outside, Kuala Lumpur hummed on, vast and hot and indifferent to the small dramas unfolding in its oldest buildings. The Petronas Towers stood watch over the city like chrome headstones, beautiful and meaningless, catching the light of a moon that nobody on the rooftop had thought to look up and see.

In his private room on the third floor, Felix Decker set down two empty beer bottles on his nightstand, aligned perfectly parallel. He opened his phone and typed a message in German to a number with a Hong Kong area code. The message was short.

*Neuer Junge. Australier. Leichtglaubig. Er wird ja sagen.*

New boy. Australian. Gullible. He will say yes.

He locked his phone, placed it face-down beside the bottles, and turned off his reading lamp. The room went dark except for the red glow bleeding under the door from the hallway lanterns.

Felix closed his eyes and slept the easy, dreamless sleep of a man who had done this many times before.
