# Chapter 10: Comfortable

---

The call to prayer came at 5:32 AM, as it always did, rising from the minarets of Masjid Jamek in a long, wavering note that threaded through the pre-dawn dark and found its way up the air well and through the walls of Dorm 3 and into the shallows of Connor's sleep. He heard it the way you hear rain on a window when you're warm in bed -- not as information, not as meaning, but as texture. Background. Part of the room. Part of the city. Part of what KL sounded like when you'd been there long enough that the unfamiliar had become furniture.

He rolled over, pulled the pillow across his ear, and sank back down.

When he woke again it was ten fifteen, and the heat had already settled into the dorm like something that paid rent. The ceiling fan turned overhead -- *tick, tick, tick* -- stirring the air without conviction. Through the air well, the sounds of the city rose in the familiar sequence: motorbike engines, the rattle of metal shutters going up on Petaling Street, Mama Siti's wok hitting flame in the kitchen below, and somewhere, a mynah bird making its single-note declaration into the wet morning air.

Connor lay in Bed 7 and let the sounds wash over him. He didn't reach for his phone. Not immediately. Not the way he had in the first week, when the notifications were the first pulse of the day, the proof that the outside world still knew his name. Now his phone was just there, face-down on the thin mattress beside him, and the notifications could wait because the morning could wait because everything, for the first time in four years of movement, could wait.

He was comfortable. That was the word. Not happy, exactly -- happiness was too active, too demanding. This was something more dangerous: the feeling of a man who has stopped running and found that nothing was chasing him. The panic of the first week -- the money panic, the 3 AM arithmetic on the ceiling -- had receded like a tide pulling back from shore. He was settled. He had a routine. The routine had its own gravity, and gravity doesn't feel like a trap. Gravity feels like the ground.

He swung his legs off the bunk. Dressed in the order he always dressed: board shorts, singlet -- today's read SUNSET CHASER in a font manufactured in Guangzhou -- flip-flops, leather bracelet, phone in left pocket. He splashed water on his face in the second-floor bathroom where the shower head dripped its permanent percussion onto tiles the colour of old teeth.

By the time he reached the kitchen, Mama Siti had his nasi lemak waiting.

She didn't greet him. She hadn't greeted him since day three. The banana leaf was already plated -- rice, sambal, anchovies, peanuts -- assembled with the offhand precision of someone who had made this particular constellation ten thousand times. Connor placed a five-ringgit note on the counter. It vanished. He ate with his fingers the way she'd silently taught him by the fourth morning, and thought about nothing at all.

Out the front door. Past the phone repair shop -- Wei's shop -- where the fluorescent light was on and a figure hunched over the soldering bench inside. Connor walked past without looking. He'd stopped looking weeks ago. Whatever he'd seen that night -- Felix in the shop, the way Felix hadn't waved back -- had been absorbed into the sediment of things-that-didn't-matter, compacted beneath the days that followed.

He bought a roti canai from the mamak stall on the corner. Ate it standing up, watching the market unfold: stall holders shouting in Cantonese, tourist couples consulting phones, the old man with the bird cages who sat in the same spot every morning outside the temple. Connor knew this man now. Not his name, just his presence. KL was becoming legible in a way no city had before -- not in words, but in the way your body learns a room in the dark.

At eleven, his phone buzzed.

Felix: *Got one for today. Package to Jalan Ipoh. RM300. Grab at the usual.*

Connor typed back without breaking stride: *On it.*

He collected the package from Felix's room on the third floor. Brown paper, taped shut, roughly the size of a hardcover book. Felix handed it over the way you hand someone a book you've already read: casually, without ceremony. "Jalan Ipoh. Number 47. Ask for Mr. Tan." Connor slid it into his daypack without weighing it in his hand, without asking what was inside, without thinking about it at all.

The delivery took forty minutes. Grab to Jalan Ipoh. A shophouse with a metal roller door half-raised. A man took the package, examined the tape seals, nodded once. No handshake. No small talk. The brisk efficiency of a machine completing a cycle.

Connor's phone buzzed: RM300 transferred.

Banking app in the back of the Grab: RM4,280. He was earning faster than he was spending. Connor Briggs, who had never saved a ringgit in his life, was saving money. He closed the app and posted a photo of his morning roti canai -- "#streetfood #kualalumpur #digitalnomadlife" -- without a trace of irony.

This was his fourth delivery. Two envelopes, two packages. RM700 total. He barely thought about it anymore. The deliveries had migrated from the category of *unusual things I do* to the category of *things I do*, which was a shorter journey than it sounded. First you do something strange. Then you do it again. Then it's not strange. Then it's not even something you do -- it's just something that happens, automatic as breathing. The normalization was total. The normalization was the point.

He went to Grind Culture. RM14 flat white, but now the RM14 didn't sting. Scheduled three posts for Pacific Soul. Scrolled job boards he had no intention of applying to. At two, he met Priya at the Central Market. They ate ice kacang from a stall outside, the shaved ice melting in the heat, and she told him about a patient she'd seen on placement -- a man with motor neurone disease, completely lucid, completely trapped -- and Connor listened in the way he'd learned to listen to Priya, which was not the way he listened to anyone else.

That evening he emailed his parents.

He sat on Bed 7 with his laptop balanced on his knees, the ceiling fan ticking overhead, and composed the kind of email he sent once a fortnight -- breezy, reassuring, carefully emptied of any information that might cause concern.

> Hey Mum & Dad,
>
> KL is amazing!! Seriously loving it here. The food is incredible, the people are so friendly, the city has this energy that's hard to describe. I've been doing some freelance work (social media stuff) and picking up a few local gigs so the finances are actually pretty solid for once. Been exploring the whole city -- temples, markets, even went to a mosque (don't worry, I was respectful!). Made some great friends at the hostel including this really cool girl from London who's doing medicine.
>
> Thinking I might actually stay here for a few months. It's that good. Don't worry about me -- I'm eating well, sleeping well, and being smart. Promise.
>
> Love you both. Tell Megan I said hi (she won't care but tell her anyway).
>
> Connor x

He read it back. It contained three lies, four omissions, and one truth. The truth was that he was thinking about staying for months. The omissions were Felix, the deliveries, the packages, and the RM4,280 in his account that came from carrying things for a man whose income source he had never asked about.

He hit send. Connor was thinking about extending his Malaysian visa.

---

The common room was nearly empty at three in the afternoon -- the dead hours, when the morning travelers had left for their activities and the night travelers hadn't yet stirred. The ceiling fans turned. The TV was off. The red lanterns cast their permanent warm glow across the battered furniture and the bookshelf where *The Beach* had been replaced by *The God of Small Things*, as though the bookshelf had a curriculum.

Connor was on the sofa, scrolling his phone, doing the kind of nothing that takes complete attention. Priya was in the armchair across from him, her Lonely Planet on her lap, not reading it. She was watching him. He could feel it -- the pressure of being watched by someone who sees you clearly -- but he hadn't looked up yet because looking up meant acknowledging the thing that had been sitting between them for two days, the thing that had no name but had a shape, the shape of a question that Priya had been carrying and Connor had been avoiding.

"Connor."

He looked up. She was pushing her glasses up her nose -- the gesture she made when she was about to say something careful.

"Yeah?"

"Can I ask you something?"

"Always." He smiled. The Instagram smile. Confident, easy, bulletproof.

"Those deliveries you do for Felix."

The smile held. The thing behind the smile -- the thing that was not a smile at all but a wall built from charm and eye contact -- went up another six inches.

"Yeah? What about them?"

"What exactly is in the packages you carry?"

He'd been ready for this. Not consciously, but some deeper mechanism -- the survival engine that ran beneath his awareness -- had been assembling the answer for weeks. It came out smooth and warm and so reasonable it almost convinced him.

"Phone accessories. Chargers, cables, that sort of thing. Felix does consulting for import businesses. I'm basically a courier."

"Have you ever opened one?"

"No. Why would I? They're sealed for the client."

"Don't you think that's odd?"

"What's odd about it?"

Priya set the Lonely Planet down on the armrest. The rubber bands that held it together shifted, a small sound in the quiet room. She leaned forward, elbows on her knees, and looked at him with an expression he recognised from the cave at Batu -- the doctor's patience, the willingness to wait for the truth to surface on its own.

"Connor, don't you think it's odd that he won't let you see what you're carrying? That the packages are always sealed, always taped shut? That you never meet these clients in a normal place -- it's always the back of a shop, or a loading dock, or a man at a door who takes the package and closes the door?"

"It's business, babe. Confidentiality. This is how import-export works."

"It's not how import-export works." Her voice was level, controlled -- the voice of someone who had spent three years of medical school learning how to deliver information that patients didn't want to hear. "Normal businesses use courier services. DHL. FedEx. Pos Laju. They don't use backpackers carrying brown paper packages across the city by Grab."

The word *backpackers* landed wrong. He felt it in his chest -- not as logic, not as argument, but as insult. He wasn't a backpacker being used. He was an entrepreneur seizing an opportunity. There was a difference. He was certain there was a difference.

"You don't know Felix," he said.

"I know what this looks like."

"And what does it look like, Priya? What does it look like to you?"

He hadn't meant his voice to harden. It hardened anyway. The warmth between them -- the warmth that had been building for two weeks, through Batu Caves and night markets and afternoon walks and the particular intimacy of two people learning each other's rhythms -- cooled by several degrees in the time it took to finish the sentence.

Priya held his gaze. Behind the round glasses, her eyes were steady and dark and holding something that was not quite fear and not quite anger but was close enough to both that the distinction didn't matter.

"It looks like something I've read about," she said. "In the guidebook. In the news. It looks like something that happens in this part of the world to people who don't ask questions."

"Right. Because you read it in a guidebook, that makes it real. Meanwhile, I've actually been doing this. I've met Felix. I've done the deliveries. Nothing has happened. Nothing dodgy, nothing weird. Just a bloke paying me to carry phone accessories because his regular driver isn't always available."

"Connor--"

"You don't know Felix. Not the way I do. He's a photographer. He does import-export on the side. He's been nothing but good to me. And frankly--" He caught himself. The sentence had been heading toward *it's none of your business*, which was the one thing he knew, even in this moment, would break something that couldn't be fixed. He diverted. "Look, I appreciate you caring. I do. But I've been doing this for four years. Traveling, living on my own, dealing with people. I know how to read people. Felix is good people."

Priya was quiet for a long time. The ceiling fan turned. Somewhere on the second floor, a door closed. Through the air well, the sound of the afternoon call to prayer began, distant and beautiful and completely meaningless to the man on the sofa who was too busy defending his own blindness to hear anything at all.

"Okay," she said. Not agreement. Surrender of a different kind -- the surrender of someone who has extended a hand and had it pushed away and knows that extending it again will only make the refusal permanent.

She picked up her Lonely Planet. Opened it to a page she wasn't going to read. The rubber bands snapped softly against the cover.

Connor picked up his phone. Opened Instagram. Scrolled through a feed of sunsets and flat whites and people pretending their lives were curated.

Between them, in the warm amber light of the common room, a crack had appeared. It wasn't visible. It didn't make a sound. But both of them felt it -- the particular silence that descends when two people have stopped talking about the thing that matters and started performing the pretence that everything is fine.

They sat like that for twenty minutes. Then Priya closed the guidebook, said "I'm going to shower," and left the room without looking at him.

Connor watched her go. He felt a flash of guilt -- or the shadow of guilt, the pressure drop before a storm. He pushed it down. He was good at pushing things down.

*She's overthinking it. She's a med student. They're trained to see pathology everywhere.*

The rationalisation machine ran. It had been running since he was eighteen and dropped out of university and told his parents it was a *conscious choice*. It had been running every time someone told him something he didn't want to hear and he converted their concern into their problem. The crack between him and Priya didn't close. But he stopped looking at it, which amounted to the same thing.

---

Tomoko Sato did not sit down.

She appeared in the common room forty minutes after Priya left, while Connor was still on the sofa, still scrolling. She came from the staircase -- the third step squeaked -- and walked to where he was sitting and stood over him with her arms crossed.

No camera today. Plain black T-shirt, cargo pants, the red-tipped hair dark and damp. Her expression was the one she always wore -- neutral, watchful, the face of someone who had decided long ago that charm was a weapon.

"Connor. I need to say something."

He looked up from his phone. "Sure. What's up?"

"Your friend Felix."

The words landed like coins on a counter. Connor's jaw tightened. Two conversations about Felix in one afternoon. The universe apparently had opinions.

"I've seen men like him before," Tomoko said. "In Myanmar. In Laos. In the Philippines. They're always charming. They always have money. They always have a private room. They always need 'someone reliable.'"

She said *someone reliable* with quotation marks made of voice, the inflection precise and deliberate, like a scalpel unwrapping suture silk.

Connor sat up straighter. "And what exactly are you saying?"

"I'm saying be careful. The people Felix knows are not who he says they are. The money he has is not from photography."

"You don't know Felix."

"I know his type."

"His type? What, German?"

The joke -- if it was a joke -- fell into the silence and died there. Tomoko's expression didn't change. She had the particular stillness of someone who had stood in front of warlords and corrupt officials and was not going to be deflected by an Australian in a singlet attempting sarcasm.

"Dangerous," she said. "I'm saying his type is dangerous. I've watched him since the first week. The cash. The packages. The people who come to the hostel at night and go to the third floor and leave before morning. The way he looks at you when you're not looking at him."

Connor felt something cold move through his chest -- a quick, involuntary contraction, the body's honest response to a truth the mind had not yet processed. The way he looks at you when you're not looking at him. For a half-second, the image surfaced: Felix in Wei's shop, bent over the table, not waving back. The camera-flash memory of something seen and immediately unseen.

He pushed it down. The machine ran.

"Look, I don't know what your problem is with Felix. He's my mate. He's been nothing but good to me. He's helped me out when I was broke, he's introduced me to people, he's--" Connor heard himself building the case and felt the familiar heat of defensive certainty, the kind that burns hottest when you're defending something you haven't examined. "And frankly, it's none of your business."

Tomoko looked at him for a long moment. The ceiling fan turned overhead. Through the air well, the mynah bird sang its one note.

"I've said what I came to say," she said.

She walked away. Her footsteps were quiet on the cracked tiles. The third step didn't squeak on the way up -- she knew where to place her feet, the way someone who watches everything learns the geography of a building's betrayals.

Connor watched her go and felt the guilt arrive faster this time -- a hot bloom in his stomach. *She's just uptight. She's probably jealous she didn't think of the side hustle herself.*

The rationalisations came, each one thinner than the last, like cards from a deck running out.

*Felix is a photographer. It's import-export. The packages are phone accessories. I've done four deliveries and nothing has happened. Nothing has happened. Nothing has happened.*

He said it three times because repetition is how spells work, and what Connor was doing -- what he had been doing since the first envelope -- was casting a spell on himself. An incantation of normalcy. A prayer to the god of she'll-be-right. And the god answered, as that god always does, by making the thing you're afraid of invisible for a little while longer.

He went upstairs to shower. Stood under the cold spray and felt the two warnings -- Priya's face, Tomoko's voice -- circle each other in his mind like fish in a bowl, going around and around, never arriving anywhere. The water ran. The warnings dissolved. He towelled off with the blue Sea to Summit and went to meet Priya for dinner as though nothing had happened, because the definition of *something happening* was one he controlled, and he had decided that this wasn't it.

---

The rooftop at night was the place where Connor went to feel like the person he performed on Instagram.

The plastic chairs. The clothesline swaying empty. The Petronas Towers between the shophouse roofs and the snarl of electrical wire, silver and luminous against the dark. It was after eleven. Priya had gone to bed early. They'd had dinner at the Indian place on Jalan Tun Sambanthan -- the conversation warm but careful, two people navigating around the thing they'd argued about.

She'd kissed him goodnight at the door to Dorm 4. A brief kiss, her hand on his arm. Then the door closed and he'd stood in the hallway trying to name the feeling in his chest, which was something between gratitude and loss, like holding a cup you know you're going to drop.

Now he was alone. He had a Tiger, bought from the cooler behind reception, RM8, paid for with Felix's money -- though Connor didn't think of it as Felix's money anymore. It was his money. He'd earned it. It was all just logistics. Just moving things from one place to another.

He called his mother.

She picked up on the second ring. She always picked up on the second ring -- never the first, never the third. By the third ring the anxiety would have already started, the quick inventory of worst-case scenarios that mothers run in the time between the second ring and the voicemail.

"Connor! Are you alright?"

She always started with this. Not *hello*, not *how are you*, but *are you alright*, as though every phone call from her son was potentially the one where everything had gone wrong.

"I'm fine, Mum. I'm great, actually. Just sitting on the hostel roof looking at the Petronas Towers."

"Oh, lovely. I've seen photos. They look enormous."

"They are. Like, properly massive. You can see them from everywhere in the city. It's like they're watching you."

"That's a bit creepy, darling."

He laughed. "Nah, it's beautiful. KL's beautiful. I wish you could see it."

"Well, your father and I were saying just the other day that we should do a trip. Maybe next year. When you're -- well, wherever you are next year."

The sentence snagged on the word *wherever*. Connor heard the weight of it -- the gentle, careful weight of a mother who had learned not to ask *when are you coming home* because the answer had stopped changing and had started hurting.

"How's Dad?"

"Oh, he's fine. Playing golf on Saturdays, which you'd think would be enough, but now he's joined a Tuesday group as well. I think he's avoiding the garden."

"Tell him I said g'day."

"I will. Oh -- Megan got a promotion. She's some sort of senior analyst now. At that firm in the city. She's very pleased."

"Good for Megs." He said it and meant approximately forty percent of it. The other sixty percent was the complicated alloy of jealousy and guilt and defensive dismissal that Megan's achievements always produced in him -- the reminder that the Briggs family conveyor belt was still running and he was the only one who'd stepped off.

"And how are you, really?" Karen said. "Are you eating properly? Sleeping?"

"Mum, I'm eating the best food of my life. There's this woman at the hostel -- Mama Siti -- she makes this coconut rice thing every morning. It's unbelievable."

"That's nice, love. And you're being careful? Your father saw something on the news -- one of those current affairs programs -- about drug crime in Malaysia. Something about trafficking. It sounded quite frightening."

The word *trafficking* arrived on the rooftop like a cold draught through an open window. Connor felt it move across his skin and then felt himself close the window.

"Always careful, Mum. You know me."

"I know you *think* you're invincible," she said, with the particular tone of a mother who has been watching her child walk toward edges since before he could walk, who has spent twenty-seven years calculating the distance between his confidence and the ground. "I just want you to be safe, Connor. That's all I ever want."

"I'm always safe, Mum. Promise."

He meant it. He genuinely, completely, profoundly meant it. He was sitting on a rooftop in a city he'd come to love, drinking a beer, talking to his mother, and the sincerity of his promise was total and unperformed and that was what made it devastating -- not that he was lying, but that he believed absolutely in the truth of a statement that could not have been more wrong.

"I love you, darling."

"Love you too, Mum."

"Call me next week? On Sunday, if you can. Your father will be home."

"Will do."

"Goodnight. Or -- good morning? I always get confused with the time difference."

"It's night here, Mum. Late."

"Well, get some sleep. And eat your vegetables."

He laughed. "There aren't a lot of vegetables in Malaysian food."

"Then find some. Goodnight, Connor."

"Night, Mum."

The call ended. The screen went dark. Connor sat with the phone in one hand and the beer in the other and felt something expand in his chest -- a warmth different from the humid air, different from the beer. It was the warmth of being loved without conditions, without performance -- uncomplicated, unearned, the kind that came from Melbourne and arrived intact despite twelve time zones. His mother loved the real him -- the boy who'd skinned his knees in Hawthorn, the teenager who'd failed chemistry. She loved the man on the rooftop, though she had no idea that the man she loved was carrying packages for a trafficker and calling it logistics.

He thought about Priya, asleep two floors below. Jake, at a bar on Changkat. The hostel -- the red lanterns, the squeaking third step, Mama Siti's kitchen. The building that had absorbed him the way it absorbed everyone, offering warmth and the gentle narcotic of belonging.

He thought about none of the things he should have been thinking about.

*This is the life,* Connor thought. *This is what people back home will never understand. This right here. The rooftop and the skyline and the warm night and the beer and the money and the girl and the friends and the hostel that feels like home. Everything is exactly right. Everything is exactly where it should be.*

He finished his beer. He sat for a while longer -- not thinking, not performing, not curating. Just being. A man on a rooftop in a country whose laws he'd never read, in a building that had been a warehouse and a military office and a gambling den and a brothel and was now the place where Connor Briggs had found the thing he'd been looking for without knowing he was looking for it.

Comfort. The most dangerous thing in the world.

He went downstairs at midnight. Climbed into Bed 7 and pulled the blue towel over his chest and lay there in the dark, listening to the ceiling fan tick and the air well breathe and the city hum its endless, indifferent hum.

He was happy. Not the performed happiness of Instagram, but the quiet, real, dangerous happiness of a man who has mistaken the floor of a trap for solid ground.

It was the last time he would feel this way.

---

Morning. Day 15.

The knock came at six AM, while the call to prayer was still echoing across the rooftops. Connor was deep in sleep. The knock pulled him up through layers of unconsciousness and deposited him in the real world with a jolt. The dorm was grey with early light. The ceiling fan turned. The French guy above was a motionless lump.

Three raps. Precise. Patient.

Connor swung his legs off the bunk, rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, and shuffled to the door. He was in his board shorts, shirtless, his hair a construction of sleep and humidity. He opened the door and squinted into the hallway.

Felix was there.

Clean shirt, linen shorts, leather sandals, the scar on his eyebrow catching the grey light. But something was different. The usual Felix -- the smiling Felix, the one who made you feel chosen and warm -- was not entirely present. In his place was something leaner, as though the charming surface had been peeled back to reveal the mechanism beneath. His eyes were steady and held none of the social warmth Connor had come to expect. They were the eyes of a man at work.

"Morning, Connor." His voice was calm, measured, the German accent a little more pronounced than usual, the way it got when Felix was being precise rather than performing. "Got something different for today. Can we talk on the roof?"

Connor blinked. "What time is it?"

"Just after six. Sorry for the early start."

"Yeah, mate. No worries." He yawned, scratched his jaw, tried to assemble his face into something that looked awake. "Give me five."

"Of course." Felix inclined his head -- a small, European gesture that managed to convey both patience and expectation. "I'll be up there."

He turned and walked down the hallway. His footsteps were quiet. The third step didn't squeak.

Connor closed the door. The call to prayer was fading through the air well, the muezzin's voice thinning to silence.

He pulled on a singlet -- GOOD VIBES ONLY, soft and thin from washing in hostel sinks across three countries. Flip-flops. Phone from the mattress.

On the way out, he steadied himself against the bunk frame with one hand, his fingers wrapping around the wooden edge as he ducked under the upper bunk. His palm pressed flat against the wood. His fingers curled over the rail. Beneath them, carved into the grain by a fingernail or a key or the desperate edge of a coin, were five letters: L-E-N-A.

He didn't look down. He didn't feel the grooves. His hand was there for a second, maybe two, and then it was gone and he was in the hallway and the door was closing behind him and the name was behind him, unseen, unread, unfelt.

The way it had been since the first night. The way it would stay.

He climbed the staircase -- the third step squeaked -- and pushed through the rooftop access door. The Petronas Towers caught the early light, silver against the brightening sky.

Felix was standing at the zinc railing. He didn't turn. His posture was relaxed but not casual -- the posture of a man who has arranged things and is waiting for the next arrangement to begin.

"So," Connor said, dropping into a plastic chair, "what's up?"

Felix turned. He looked at Connor for a long moment -- the kind of look you give something you've been building when you've finished the foundation and are ready to start on the walls. Then he smiled. The smile was thinner than usual, more efficient -- a smile that existed to facilitate a transaction rather than create warmth. The mask was thinner today. Connor didn't notice, because Connor had never noticed the mask.

"I've got something a bit different," Felix said. "Something bigger. Better money. But I want to explain it properly."

He pulled up a chair and sat across from Connor. Behind them, the Petronas Towers watched. Below, the city moved.

Part 1 ended here, on a rooftop in Kuala Lumpur, with the call to prayer fading and the morning light growing and a twenty-seven-year-old Australian in a GOOD VIBES ONLY singlet sitting across from the man who was going to get him killed, waiting to hear what came next.

He waited the way he did everything: confidently, carelessly, with the serene certainty of a person who had never once in his life imagined that the ground beneath him might not hold.
