# Chapter 8: The Package

The box was on the table between the toast and the Vegemite.

Connor almost didn't see it. Felix had arranged the scene with the casual precision that characterized everything he did -- a plate of white bread toast, a knife, an open jar of Vegemite that he must have bought from an import store somewhere in the city because it damn well didn't come from the hostel kitchen, and there, slightly to the left, in a plastic bag from a 7-Eleven, a brown paper package about the size of a shoebox. Wrapped neatly. Taped shut. Unremarkable. The kind of thing you'd walk past in a post office without a second thought.

"Morning," Felix said.

He was sitting in the wicker chair by the common room window, where the morning light fell in a flat white sheet through the glass and made everything look like a photograph of itself. He was eating toast with the methodical, unhurried attention he brought to everything -- small bites, clean fingers, the knife wiped on a napkin between spreads. His linen shirt was fresh, his leather sandals clean. He looked like someone in an advertisement for a lifestyle that didn't exist.

It was just past nine. The common room of The Lantern Hostel had the drowsy, half-assembled feeling of a Tuesday morning in a backpacker hostel -- a French girl on the vinyl couch scrolling her phone, the ceiling fans turning with their eternal, futile patience, CNN murmuring from the wall-mounted TV about something happening in a country that was not this one. Through the arched doorway to the air well, the sound of Mama Siti's pans. The smell of coconut rice and sambal, threading through the humid air like a summons.

Connor had come downstairs in his board shorts and a singlet that said *GOOD VIBES ONLY* in faded block letters. His hair was still damp from the shower -- the one that ran lukewarm if you caught it before eight-thirty and cold after. His phone was at forty-seven percent. He'd checked Instagram before his eyes were fully open: eleven likes on last night's sunset photo from the pedestrian bridge, a comment from Jake that said "DUDE sick shot" with three fire emojis, and a DM request from a bot pretending to be a swimwear model. Standard morning.

"Is that Vegemite?" Connor said.

"I remembered you mentioned it. Found some at a specialty store in Bangsar." Felix pushed the jar toward him. "Consider it a professional courtesy."

"Mate. Legend. You absolute legend."

Connor sat down, reached for the bread, and began assembling toast with the focused pleasure of a man reunited with his national condiment. He spread the Vegemite thin -- he wasn't an animal -- and took a bite, and the salty, yeasty, deeply specific taste of home hit him with a force that was briefly, unexpectedly emotional. He thought of his mum's kitchen in Hawthorn, the white Formica bench, the jar of Vegemite that was always there, that was as fixed a part of the house as the walls. He swallowed.

Felix watched him eat. He had the patience for it. He had the patience for everything.

"So," Felix said, after Connor's third bite. "I've got a job for you."

Connor's eyes went to the plastic bag on the table. The brown paper package inside it.

"Same deal as before," Felix continued, as if he were describing the weather. "Delivery. Brickfields this time. Near KL Sentral." He nodded at the package. "Phone accessories. Chargers, cables, screen protectors. There's a distributor in Little India who sells them -- small electronics shop, wholesale operation. He orders in bulk from a supplier here in Chinatown, but the shipping takes forever and the couriers are unreliable. I've been helping him cut out the middleman."

The explanation arrived fully formed, pre-assembled, with the seamless logic of a story that had been told many times. Felix delivered it while buttering another piece of toast, his voice level, his eyes on the bread, the whole performance communicating one thing: *this is boring. This is mundane. This is beneath our attention.*

"Three hundred ringgit," Felix added. "Shouldn't take more than an hour."

Connor swallowed his toast. Three hundred ringgit. Ninety-something Australian dollars. For walking a box from Chinatown to Brickfields -- a distance he could have covered in twenty minutes on the LRT. He'd done two envelope deliveries for Felix already over the past few days, both smooth, both quick, both followed by the little buzz of a GrabPay notification that felt like the world tipping in his favor. RM200 each time. This was more. This was a raise.

"Three hundred?" he said. "For phone chargers?"

"Portable chargers. Power banks. Screen protectors in bulk. The box is heavier than you'd think." Felix smiled. The scar through his eyebrow caught the light. "The markup on accessories is insane. The distributor makes good money, so he pays good money to keep his supply chain moving. Simple economics."

"Yeah," Connor said. "No, yeah, that makes sense."

He reached across the table and pulled the plastic bag toward him. The package inside was wrapped in brown paper, the kind you'd find at any stationery store, sealed with clear packing tape in neat horizontal strips. No labels, no address, no return sender. Just a box, wrapped, anonymous. He picked it up.

The weight was wrong.

He knew it immediately, in the way the body knows things before the mind catches up -- the same way your hand pulls back from a hot surface before the pain signal arrives. The package was heavy. Not impossibly heavy, not suspicious-on-its-own heavy, but heavier than a shoebox of phone chargers and cables should be. He was holding maybe a kilo and a half, possibly more. The weight sat in his hands with a density that spoke of something packed tight, something compressed, something that occupied less space than its mass suggested.

"This is heavier than I expected," he said.

He said it casually. He heard it casually. But somewhere deep in the machinery of his nervous system, in the reptile brain where survival instincts lived, a wire tripped. A small electrical pulse, smaller than a thought, more like the shadow of one: *wrong*.

Felix didn't miss a beat. He never missed beats. Missing beats was for amateurs and the guilty.

"Power banks," he said. "Those things are basically bricks. Lithium batteries, yeah? Dense as anything." He took a sip of his instant coffee, holding the cup with both hands, unhurried. "I had to carry a box of twenty from Sim Lim Square in Singapore once. Nearly threw my back out."

Connor nodded. Of course. Power banks. Lithium batteries. Dense. He knew this -- he'd owned a power bank once, briefly, before leaving it at a guesthouse in Hoi An. Those things were heavy. Everyone knew that.

The wire in his reptile brain went slack. The shadow of the thought dissolved. The package was just a package, heavy because power banks were heavy, sealed because that's how you shipped things, anonymous because Felix's supplier was a wholesale operation and wholesale operations didn't bother with fancy labeling. The logic was clean, airtight, self-reinforcing. It was also a construction, built piece by piece over nine days of carefully dispensed trust, free beers, and Vegemite.

Connor put the package in his daypack. It sat at the bottom like ballast, adding weight, pulling the straps taut against his shoulders. He zipped the bag shut.

"Address?" he said.

Felix produced his phone, typed something, and sent it. Connor's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and read the message: a street name in Brickfields, a building number, and a single instruction.

*Back entrance. Metal door. Knock twice.*

"His name's Mr. Tan," Felix said. "He doesn't talk much. Don't take it personally -- he's just busy. Hand over the package, he'll check it, and you're done. I'll send the payment as soon as he confirms."

"Easy."

"Easy," Felix agreed. He raised his coffee cup in a small salute. "You're good at this, Connor. Some people overthink it. You just do it."

Connor grinned. The compliment landed where Felix intended it -- in the part of Connor that was hungry for validation, for the sense that he was good at something, that his casual, untethered approach to life was not a deficit but a talent. *You just do it.* Felix made it sound like a philosophy. Like something you'd put on a motivational poster, or a singlet.

"Back in an hour," Connor said, and headed for the door.

He passed through the narrow entrance corridor with the daypack riding heavy on his shoulders, the red paper lanterns glowing overhead in their perpetual amber procession. The phone repair shop on his left was already open -- the fluorescent light buzzing, the window display of cracked screens and coiled cables, and behind the counter, a man Connor had never properly looked at, sorting through components with quick, precise fingers. Wei. Not that Connor knew his name.

He stepped onto Petaling Street, and the city took him.

---

The walk from Chinatown to Brickfields was a lesson in KL's layers, though Connor wasn't the type to learn lessons that didn't come with likes and engagement.

He headed south along Jalan Sultan, past morning market stragglers packing up stalls -- vendors folding tarpaulins, hosing down pavement with water that ran brown into the storm drains. The air was already thick with heat, the humidity doing that thing it did in KL where you stepped outside and your body immediately began losing a fight it hadn't agreed to participate in. The daypack straps bit into his shoulders. The package sat at the bottom of the bag, a dense weight against his lower spine.

He passed the Guan Di Temple on the corner, incense drifting from its open doors. He passed a man drinking kopi-o at a marble-topped table outside a kopitiam, and for a moment Connor saw Felix in the posture -- the same unhurried confidence, the same sense of a man who knew exactly where he was.

He was filming. Phone in his right hand, narrating in the low, conspiratorial voice of his content persona: "Morning walk through Chinatown, KL. Day nine. This is what travel's about, guys. The real streets."

He was carrying a package of unknown contents toward a delivery address specified by a man he'd met nine days ago, and he was filming it for content. Connor's mind was a room with all the lights on and all the doors locked.

He turned onto Jalan Tun Sambanthan and the world changed. Chinatown fell away in the space of a single block.

Brickfields. Little India.

The transition was total. Chinatown's red-and-gold palette gave way to saffron and magenta and the electric blue of Hindu temple gopurams rising above rooftops like frozen fireworks. Sari shops lined both sides of the street, their storefronts hung with silk in every colour the eye could register -- emerald, vermillion, violet, a gold so bright it looked like it should be warm to the touch. Between them, garland sellers sat behind cascading displays of jasmine and marigold, the flowers strung on thread in thick ropes, the scent so sweet and dense it was almost narcotic. Tamil replaced Cantonese -- rapid, musical, a whole new frequency. A Hindi film song blared from a speaker above a sari shop with a volume that suggested the owner had confused music with a military offensive. Two women in salwar kameez walked past, their conversation a bright, overlapping duet that Connor couldn't parse but instinctively understood was gossip of the highest order.

And the food -- curry leaves frying in oil, the deep warmth of a biryani pot simmering since dawn, cardamom-laced chai steam rising from a streetside stall. Banana leaf rice restaurants were opening, long tables covered in fresh green leaves like place settings.

Connor filmed it all, turning in a slow circle on the pavement.

"Okay, this is insane," he said to his phone. "We've basically left one country and entered another. This is what I mean about KL, guys. Layers."

He walked deeper into the neighborhood, following Felix's GPS pin. Past a roti canai stall where dough stretched and spun in the air like a thin, wheaten planet.

He stopped at the garland sellers -- three stalls in a row, three women on low stools, their hands working with a speed that made the process invisible. Flowers in, garland out. Connor took a photo: brown hands against white jasmine, marigold garlands hanging in thick orange ropes behind. He'd caption it something about "the art of everyday life" or some other borrowed profundity.

"For the temple," one seller said, holding up a finished garland. "For prayer. You want?"

"Oh, nah, I'm not really--"

"Five ringgit."

Connor bought one. He had no temple to bring it to, no prayer to offer. But the garland was beautiful, and the jasmine smelled like something he couldn't name but wanted to be near. He draped it over his daypack strap, where it hung against the bag's grey fabric like a bright and fragrant rebuke.

Inside the bag, beneath the garland, the package sat dense and anonymous, waiting.

---

The address was on a side street off the main Brickfields drag, where the sari shops and restaurants thinned out and the buildings became more industrial -- low concrete structures with roller shutters, wholesale operations dealing in textiles, electronics, cleaning supplies. The street was quieter here. The Hindi music from the speakers didn't reach this far. A lorry was unloading boxes at a warehouse entrance, two men in work clothes passing cardboard cartons hand-to-hand with the rhythm of an assembly line.

Connor found the building. It was a narrow, two-story concrete structure with a roller shutter at the front -- currently down -- and a sign above it in English and Chinese: **GLOBAL TECH WHOLESALE SDN BHD**. An electronics wholesaler. Just as Felix had described. The sign was faded and the building was unremarkable, the kind of place you'd walk past without seeing, which was, of course, part of the arrangement.

He walked around to the back, as instructed.

The alley behind the building was narrow and shaded, the kind of space that existed between buildings in KL by accident rather than design -- a gap where rubbish bins sat and air-conditioning units dripped condensation and cats investigated things in the shadows. The ground was uneven concrete, cracked and stained. A steel door was set into the back wall of the building, painted grey, no handle on the outside. No window. No signage. Just a door, in a wall, in an alley.

Connor knocked twice.

He waited. The alley was quiet. He could hear the lorry at the warehouse a few doors down, the distant hum of traffic on the main road, a bird somewhere above him producing a sound like a squeaky hinge. The jasmine garland on his daypack strap was wilting already in the heat, the petals browning at the edges.

The door opened.

A man stood in the doorway. Middle-aged, Chinese-Malaysian, with close-cropped grey hair and a face that gave nothing away. He wore a white polo shirt and dark trousers and he looked at Connor the way you'd look at a package on your doorstep -- noting its presence without welcoming it.

"Hi," Connor said. "I'm here from Felix? I've got a delivery."

The man said nothing. His eyes dropped to Connor's daypack.

Connor swung the bag off his shoulder, unzipped it, and pulled out the brown paper package. He held it out. The man took it with both hands -- quickly, smoothly, the way you'd receive something you'd been expecting. He didn't thank Connor. He didn't make eye contact. He didn't step aside to reveal the interior of the building, which remained a dark rectangle behind him, lit by the blue-white glow of fluorescent tubes. Connor caught a glimpse of shelves, of cardboard boxes stacked to the ceiling, of something that might have been a counter or a desk, and then the man stepped back and the door began to close.

The whole exchange took fifteen seconds.

The door shut with a click that was softer than Connor expected -- not a slam, not a statement, just a quiet, mechanical sealing of one space from another. Like an airlock. Like a mouth closing around something it didn't want to show you.

Connor stood in the alley for a moment.

Something bothered him.

He couldn't identify it. It wasn't the man's silence -- some people were quiet. It wasn't the back door -- wholesale operations often used rear entrances for deliveries. It wasn't the steel door itself, or the lack of signage, or the fluorescent light. It was something about the totality. The silence, the speed, the avoidance of eye contact, the door closing before he could see inside. It was the feeling you get when you're watching a movie and the music changes key and you know something is about to happen even though nothing on screen has changed. A tonal shift. An atmospheric pressure drop.

*That was weird,* Connor thought.

And then his phone buzzed.

He pulled it from his pocket. A GrabPay notification.

**RM300 received from F. DECKER**

Three hundred ringgit. The number sat on his screen in the clean sans-serif font of financial apps, simple and undeniable. Ninety-something dollars. For walking a box through a colorful neighborhood and handing it to a man through a steel door. The discomfort in his chest -- the tonal shift, the atmospheric pressure drop -- receded like a tide going out. Not disappeared. Receded. The difference was important, because disappeared would have meant it was resolved, and receded meant it was still there, under the surface, waiting for the next thing to bring it back.

But Connor didn't do subtext. Connor didn't do undercurrents. Connor lived on the surface of his life the way a water strider lives on the surface of a pond -- entirely, confidently, and with no understanding whatsoever of the depth beneath him.

He pocketed his phone, walked out of the alley, and stopped for a teh tarik at a streetside cart, drinking it in three long gulps. He paid with a five and told the vendor to keep the change, feeling generous and expansive -- an identity he could afford now.

The garland on his daypack had given up entirely, jasmine petals browning and dropping from the string. He plucked it off and draped it over a bollard. A small offering, left by a man who didn't know he was praying.

---

He walked back through Brickfields toward Chinatown, passing KL Sentral where commuters streamed in and out in office clothes and reusable coffee cups. Connor moved through them like a different species -- board shorts, flip-flops, daypack, man-bun. Two worlds, occupying the same pavement, going in opposite directions.

He was feeling good. Better than good. Seven hundred ringgit total now, from three deliveries over four days. That was more than his parents sent him in a week. That was financial independence, or something close to it.

He crossed a main road and on the far side, a police officer was standing on the corner.

He was standing the way Malaysian police officers stand -- feet apart, hands behind his back, the posture of a man who has been given a post and intends to occupy it with maximum visibility. He wore the dark blue uniform of the Royal Malaysia Police, peaked cap pulled low, and he was speaking on his phone, his free hand resting on his belt near the holstered baton. He was not looking at Connor. He was looking at nothing in particular. He was just *present* -- a uniform, an authority, a representative of a system that Connor did not understand and had never tried to.

The officer glanced up as Connor passed.

Connor's stomach dropped.

It was instant, involuntary, and total -- a flash of fear so pure and primal it bypassed every cognitive filter he'd built and hit him in the gut like a physical blow. His hand tightened on his daypack strap. His pace quickened by a half-step. His vision narrowed for a fraction of a second, tunneling, the officer's blue uniform becoming the only thing in his visual field, everything else -- the traffic, the pedestrians, the bus, the orange-sticky kid -- falling away into peripheral noise.

His body knew. Without language, without logic -- adrenal glands firing, heart rate spiking, muscles tensing along the flight pathway. The ancient mammalian hardware preparing to run from a predator it had identified before the thinking brain registered the threat.

Then the thinking brain caught up: *I'm not carrying anything.* The package was delivered. The bag was empty. He was clean.

Connor's hand loosened on the strap. He smiled at the officer. The officer didn't smile back -- his eyes lingered a moment and moved on. A non-event.

Connor walked on. He didn't explore the connection between the flash of fear and the package he'd just delivered, between the adrenal spike and the brown paper and packing tape and the weight that was wrong. He didn't ask himself the question his nervous system had just asked and answered in the space of a heartbeat: *Why would an innocent man be afraid of a police officer?*

He walked on, because Connor Briggs walked on from everything -- from warning signs and proverbs and guidebook sections and women who tried to tell him things -- and the walking on was not a conscious strategy but a reflex, as automatic and as doomed as the rabbit that freezes in headlights and then bolts too late.

Two blocks later, the fear was gone. Not resolved -- gone. Overwritten by the smell of satay, the brightness of the sky, the pleasant weight of RM300 in his digital wallet.

He stopped on a pedestrian bridge and leaned against the railing. The Towers caught the late morning light to the east. Below him, traffic poured through an intersection in streams of color and noise. He was absolutely certain he was winning at life -- the certainty of a man who had never once stopped moving long enough to check whether the ground beneath his feet was solid.

---

That evening, Connor was on the vinyl couch, phone in hand, scrolling Instagram.

He'd showered, eaten Mama Siti's nasi lemak (she'd looked at him again with that expression he couldn't read, the one that seemed to come from a long way away), and settled in with the comfortable heaviness of a man who'd earned his evening. Priya was in the kitchen making tea. They hadn't talked about last night's kiss yet. Everything was later with Connor.

His thumb moved through the feed on autopilot -- swipe, pause, double-tap. Sunsets, flat-lays, hostel memes. He drifted into the Explore page, Instagram's algorithmic underworld, where the app served you content based on your pauses and taps and the things you looked at two seconds longer than other things.

A post caught his eye.

The account was @HostelReaper.

Connor's thumb stopped. He recognized the name -- the graffiti on the wall in Chinatown, the day he'd arrived with Jake and Priya. The black marker, the small reaper icon, the words *Check-in is optional. Check-out is not.* He'd photographed it. Called it "sick street art." Hadn't thought about it since.

The profile picture was a black square. No bio, no highlights. Just a grid of posts -- backpacker gear in empty spaces.

The post in his Explore feed was a photo of a backpack sitting on an empty bus seat. Blue and grey, medium-sized, centered in the frame as if someone had placed it there and then ceased to exist. Flat fluorescent light. No people. No reflections. Just the bag, alone.

The caption: *Another one packed for the journey. #NoReturn #101Ways*

The discomfort from the delivery -- the steel door, the weight, the police officer -- flickered in Connor's chest. A pilot light of anxiety.

He looked at the photo for three more seconds. Then he scrolled.

The next post was a girl in a bikini on a beach in Bali. Connor double-tapped. A red heart bloomed.

The @HostelReaper post was already gone -- scrolled past, pushed down by algorithms and the devastating efficiency of a thumb on glass. Gone, like a proverb spoken in a kitchen. Like a name carved in wood.

---

The dorm was dark.

Connor lay in Bed 7, bottom bunk, the mattress foam thin enough to feel the wooden slats beneath. The ceiling fan clicked overhead -- the off-balance blade, the irregular metronome, counting out the night in its broken rhythm. The room smelled of insect repellent and damp wood and the faintly sweet rot of an old building in a wet climate. Through the air well opening at the far end of the room, the sounds of the city settling: a motorcycle, distant, fading. A television in another dorm, volume low. The breathing of other sleepers in other bunks, the private sounds of unconscious bodies, undisturbed. The tick of the building cooling, contracting, doing whatever old buildings do when the humans inside them sleep.

His phone buzzed.

The screen lit up in the darkness, painting his face blue-white, illuminating the wooden bed frame above him, the slats, the underside of the mattress, the graffiti carved and written by travelers past. He held the phone close to his face, squinting.

Felix.

*Good work today. You're a natural, Connor. I've got something bigger coming up -- more money. Let me know when you're ready.*

Connor read the message twice. *Good work. Natural. More money. Ready.* Each word a compliment, a validation, a small brick in the edifice of a version of himself that he wanted to believe in. Felix saw potential in him that his parents didn't, that his sister didn't, that the yoga studio in Northcote that paid him $150 a month to run their Instagram certainly didn't.

The screen's glow caught the wooden bed frame inches from his pillow. There, in the grain of the dark wood, five letters had been carved with something sharp -- a key, a knife, a fingernail pressed hard enough to leave a mark in the soft timber. The letters were small and careful, the work of someone who had been trying to be quiet, who had carved in the dark, in this bed, in this room, while the ceiling fan clicked above them the way it clicked above Connor now.

**LENA**

The light from his phone fell across the name for two full seconds. The L and the E and the N and the A were illuminated in blue-white, each letter distinct, each groove visible. The name of a twenty-two-year-old Swedish girl who had slept in this bed, who had met a charming European man in this common room, who had carried packages for that man through these streets, who was now in Kajang Prison waiting for a trial that would not go well. The name was right there. It was inches from Connor's face. All he had to do was turn his head slightly to the left. All he had to do was look.

Connor did not look. He was looking at his phone. He was composing a reply.

He typed a thumbs-up emoji and hit send.

The screen went dark. The room went dark. The name went dark, sinking back into the wood grain, invisible, patient, carved into the architecture of the bed frame like a footnote in a book no one was reading.

Somewhere on the third floor, in the private room he paid triple for, Felix Decker noted the thumbs-up emoji and updated a spreadsheet on his laptop. The spreadsheet had columns for names, dates, amounts, and reliability ratings. Connor's reliability rating had just been upgraded from 3 to 4. The scale went to 5. No one had ever reached 5. Lena had been a 4 when they arrested her.

Connor put his phone on the mattress beside his pillow, rolled onto his right side, and closed his eyes.

Sleep came quickly, as it always did for Connor. He had the gift of the unburdened mind -- the ability to pass from wakefulness to sleep without the intermediate purgatory of reflection that kept so many people staring at ceilings in the dark. No review of the day, no accounting of choices, no inventory of things that might have been done differently. Consciousness to unconsciousness in sixty seconds, like a light switch being flipped. Like a door closing.

In his sleep, Connor dreamed. A grey room, windowless, fluorescent. His blue travel towel in his hands, wrapped tight around something dense. He couldn't see what. Someone behind him he couldn't turn to see -- not wouldn't, couldn't, the dream's logic walling off the action like a locked door. The towel constricting, the microfiber pulling taut. The light buzzing louder. The presence closer. His fingers white-knuckled and unable to let go.

He woke gasping, heart hammering, sheets damp. The ceiling fan clicked its broken rhythm. The dream was already dissolving -- grey walls, a buzzing light, something in his hands, someone behind him -- falling apart even as he tried to hold the images. Within thirty seconds the dream was just a feeling. Within a minute the feeling was just a heartbeat. Within two minutes, nothing.

He reached for his phone by reflex, then stopped. The screen would light up and the blue-white glow would find Lena's name in the wood grain, though Connor didn't know this and would never know it, because he had never looked at the bed frame closely enough to see.

He closed his eyes. The fan clicked.

By morning, the dream would be gone. Only his body would carry it -- a bruise below thought, pulsing once before it too faded.

The law doesn't require your belief. That's what makes it the law.

Connor slept. The name waited in the wood.
