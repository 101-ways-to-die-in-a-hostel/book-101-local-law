See: VICTIM_PROFILE.md for full details.
- 27, Australian, digital nomad
- Fatal flaw: arrogant ignorance
- Dies: Chapter 39-40

---

### Felix Decker (THE CATALYST)
**Role:** The charming recruiter who grooms Connor as a drug mule
**Age:** 31
**Nationality:** German (Hamburg)
**Appearance:** Tall, lean, angular face, close-cropped dark hair, always immaculately dressed for a backpacker - clean linen shirts, well-fitted shorts, leather sandals. Looks like he belongs in a magazine editorial about "elevated travel." Has a thin scar on his left eyebrow from a bar fight in Manila.
**Occupation:** Claims to be a travel photographer. Actually a mid-level operative in a Southeast Asian drug trafficking network run out of Hong Kong.
**Personality:** Effortlessly charismatic. Speaks five languages. Always has money, connections, recommendations. The kind of person who makes you feel chosen when he pays attention to you. Underneath the charm: calculating, patient, utterly without remorse. He's done this before. Connor is not his first recruit, and won't be his last.
**Speech:** Precise English with a soft German accent. Never raises his voice. Uses people's names frequently. Asks questions instead of giving orders.
**Fatal flaw:** Pride - he thinks he's untouchable, smarter than the system. This may eventually catch up with him, but not in this book.
**Key function in plot:** Felix befriends Connor in Chapter 2, begins involving him in "favors" by Chapter 8, and escalates to full drug transportation by Part 2. Felix disappears from the hostel 12 hours before Connor's arrest. He is never caught.
**Room:** Private Room 1, Third Floor. Pays weekly.

### Priya Sharma (THE WARNING)
**Role:** The voice of reason Connor won't listen to; his romantic interest
**Age:** 25
**Nationality:** British-Indian (London, parents from Gujarat)
**Appearance:** Petite, dark-skinned, long black hair usually braided. Round glasses that she pushes up her nose when making a point. Dresses practically - jeans, T-shirts, trainers. Carries a battered Lonely Planet guide held together with rubber bands.
**Occupation:** Fourth-year medical student at King's College London. On a six-week break before her final year placements. Traveling solo for the first time.
**Personality:** Intelligent, cautious, empathetic. Does her research. Reads the guidebook. Learns phrases in every local language. Everything Connor is not. She's drawn to Connor's energy and confidence despite herself, and increasingly horrified by his recklessness.
**Speech:** Precise, educated, occasionally sardonic London English. Code-switches to Gujarati when talking to her mother on the phone. Uses medical terminology when stressed.
**Role in death:** Priya warns Connor directly about Malaysian drug laws in Chapter 14. She sees the suspicious relationship between Felix and Connor and confronts Felix in Chapter 22. Felix threatens her subtly, and she backs off, a decision that will haunt her. After Connor's arrest, she tries to contact his family and the Australian embassy but is too late.
**Room:** Dorm 4 (Female dorm), Third Floor.

### Jake Porter (THE MIRROR)
**Role:** Comic relief; a slightly dumber version of Connor who survives by luck
**Age:** 24
**Nationality:** American (San Diego, California)
**Appearance:** Stocky, sunburned, always wearing a backwards cap and surf brand t-shirts. Has the permanent grin of someone who has never been challenged by anything.
**Occupation:** "Taking a year off" after college (it's been two years). Business degree from SDSU. No plans.
**Personality:** Genuinely good-natured but profoundly incurious. Follows whoever is having the most fun. Loyal in a golden retriever way. Not stupid, exactly, but has never needed to be smart.
**Speech:** SoCal casual. Everything is "dude," "sick," "no way." Uptalks constantly. Uses "like" as punctuation.
**Role in death:** Jake is Connor's drinking buddy and co-adventurer in Part 1. Felix also tries to recruit Jake, but Jake leaves KL for Langkawi in Chapter 18, purely by chance avoiding the trap. He represents the road not taken - another entitled Western backpacker who survives only because he got bored and moved on. He learns about Connor's death from Instagram.
**Room:** Dorm 1, Second Floor.

---

### Tomoko Sato (THE SKEPTIC)
**Role:** The experienced traveler who sees through Felix
**Age:** 29
**Nationality:** Japanese (Osaka)
**Appearance:** Short, athletic, short-cropped hair dyed dark red at the tips. Multiple ear piercings. Carries a professional-grade camera. Has a quiet intensity that Connor finds intimidating and dismisses as "unfriendly."
**Occupation:** Freelance photojournalist. Has published in Asahi Shimbun and The Guardian. Traveling through Southeast Asia on assignment for a story about backpacker culture.
**Personality:** Observant, private, distrustful of charm. She's seen too much of the world to be naive. She notices things - the way Felix pays cash for everything, the way packages appear and disappear, the too-convenient friendship with Connor.
**Speech:** Economical English with a slight accent. Speaks in short, precise sentences. Asks uncomfortable questions. When she doesn't trust someone, she goes quiet and watches.
**Role in death:** Tomoko tries to warn Connor about Felix in Chapter 16. Connor dismisses her ("She's just jealous, mate"). Tomoko photographs Felix making a late-night exchange in Chapter 24, but before she can act on it, Felix's associates steal her camera. After Connor's death, Tomoko is the one who pieces together what happened. She may be the one who tips off authorities about the trafficking network, but too late for Connor.
**Room:** Dorm 5, Third Floor.

## Hostel Staff

### Mei Ling Chen (RECEPTION)
**Age:** 24
**Role in death:** Warning-giver (ignored)
**Key trait:** Sees everything, says little. Has worked at the hostel for two years. Keeps a mental ledger of every guest who she thinks will get into trouble. Connor was on her list from day one.
**Key scene:** Directly tells Connor "Please be careful what you carry for strangers" in Chapter 12. He laughs.

### Mama Siti (COOK)
**Age:** Unknown (looks ancient, claims to be 68, may be older)
**Role in death:** Oracle figure. Speaks in Malay proverbs that contain warnings no one understands until too late.
**Key trait:** Has been cooking at this location since before it was a hostel. Some say since before it was a brothel. Her nasi lemak brings people back from the dead, or so the saying goes. Not Connor, though.
**Key scene:** Tells Connor in Chapter 7: "Orang yang tak tahu undang-undang, undang-undang tak tahu dia" (He who doesn't know the law, the law doesn't know him). Connor asks if she has any hot sauce.

### Uncle Razak bin Omar (OWNER)
**Age:** 63
**Role in death:** The reluctant bystander. He knows about the trafficking network and has a tacit agreement: they don't recruit from his hostel, and he doesn't talk. Felix breaks this arrangement by recruiting Connor. When Razak confronts Felix (Chapter 25), Felix reminds him about the hostel's building code violations, unpaid taxes, and other leverage.
**Key trait:** Collects stories about deaths. His office has newspaper clippings, a map with red pins (hostels where people have died), and a shelf of true crime books. He sees himself as a historian, not a participant.
**Key scene:** Shows Connor the map with the red pins in Chapter 9. Connor thinks it's "sick content for Insta."

### Aziz (SECURITY/HANDYMAN)
**Age:** 50s
**Role in death:** Silent witness. Former police officer who was fired for reporting corruption. He recognizes the signs of trafficking. He says nothing because the last time he spoke up, it cost him his career and nearly his life.
**Key scene:** Fixes a fan in Connor's dorm in Chapter 6. Pauses at the door, looks at Connor, opens his mouth to say something. Closes it. Leaves.

## Secondary Characters

### Rizal (THE KILLER)
**Real name:** Unknown
**Age:** 30s
**Role:** The operative who kills Connor in the holding cell. Posed as a fellow prisoner. Professional, calm, efficient. Has done this before.
**Appears:** Chapters 39-40 only.

### Sergeant Ahmad bin Ismail (THE LAW)
**Age:** 42
**Role:** The arresting officer at the highway checkpoint. By-the-book, stern, does his job. Previously warned Connor during a random street check (Chapter 15): "Malaysia is not a game, sir." Connor nodded and forgot.
**Key function:** Represents the system - impartial, powerful, indifferent to Connor's protestations.

### Lena (THE GHOST)
**Age:** 22
**Nationality:** Swedish
**Role:** A former guest of the Lantern Hostel who was recruited by Felix a year ago. She was arrested carrying drugs to Thailand. She's currently in Kajang Prison awaiting trial. Her name is scratched into the wooden frame of Bed 7 in Dorm 3 - Connor's bed. He never notices it.

### Wei (THE SUPPLIER)
**Age:** 40s
**Nationality:** Malaysian-Chinese
**Role:** Felix's local contact. Runs a phone repair shop two doors from the hostel. The packages are assembled here. He interacts with Connor exactly once - in Chapter 20 - when Connor picks up a "phone charger" from his shop. The charger box contains 50g of methamphetamine.
