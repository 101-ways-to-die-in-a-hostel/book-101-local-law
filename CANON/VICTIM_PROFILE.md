# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Connor James Briggs
**Nickname/Handle:** @ConnorGoesGlobal
**Age:** 27
**Nationality:** Australian (Melbourne)
**Occupation:** Self-described "digital nomad" / freelance social media consultant (earns almost nothing, funded by parents)

## Archetype
**Primary:** Digital Nomad / Perpetual Backpacker

**Secondary traits:** Influencer wannabe, party animal, weaponized casual

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Arrogant Ignorance

**How it manifests:**
- Refuses to learn anything about the countries he visits ("That's what Google's for, and I never Google")
- Dismisses all warnings as "paranoia" or "cultural fear-mongering"
- Believes his Australian passport and white skin make him untouchable ("Relax, it's Asia, they love Australians")
- Treats every local custom as a quaint backdrop for content
- Never reads signs, terms, conditions, or laws - considers it beneath him

**How it kills them:**
Connor's refusal to understand Malaysian drug laws - specifically the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and its mandatory death penalty for trafficking - means he doesn't recognize when he's being groomed as a drug mule. His arrogance prevents him from questioning suspicious favors, and his belief in his own invulnerability means he ignores every warning sign until he's trapped in a system that does not care about his excuses.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 6'1", lean but soft - the body of someone who surfs occasionally but mostly drinks. Has the tan of someone who lives outdoors but the posture of someone who sits in cafes.
- **Hair:** Sun-bleached dirty blonde, perpetually messy in a way that takes effort. Man-bun when "serious."
- **Distinguishing features:** A faded tattoo of a compass on his inner forearm (got it in Bali, of course). Perpetual stubble. Always squinting slightly, as if the world is too bright.
- **Typical outfit:** Board shorts regardless of context, a rotation of "ironic" singlets (tank tops), flip-flops even in places that require closed shoes, a braided leather bracelet he bought at a full moon party.

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. **Genuinely friendly** - becomes indiscriminate trust that makes him easy to manipulate
2. **Adventurous spirit** - becomes recklessness disguised as spontaneity
3. **Easygoing nature** - becomes dangerous apathy about consequences

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. **Intellectual laziness** - leads to total ignorance of the legal system he's about to violate
2. **Entitlement** - leads to believing consequences are for other people
3. **Need to be liked** - leads to agreeing to favors he should refuse

### Pet Peeves
- People who plan their trips in detail ("You're not traveling, you're doing homework")
- Travelers who learn the local language ("It's a bit try-hard, isn't it?")
- Anyone who suggests something might be dangerous ("Mate, you sound like my mum")

### Fears
- **Surface fear:** Running out of money (would have to go home and get a real job)
- **Deeper fear:** Being ordinary - the entire nomad persona is armor against the terrifying possibility that he's just a guy from the suburbs

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in Hawthorn, Melbourne. Upper-middle-class family. Father is a property developer, mother is a GP. Had every advantage, squandered most of them with casual confidence. Did one year of a business degree at Monash University before dropping out to "find himself" in Southeast Asia. That was four years ago. His parents still deposit $2,000 AUD into his account monthly, which he supplements with occasional freelance social media work that pays almost nothing. He tells people he's "location independent."

### Why They Travel
Running from adulthood. The longer he stays abroad, the longer he can avoid the crushing realization that he has no skills, no career, no plan, and no idea who he is without the backpacker identity. Travel is his personality. Without it, he's just another entitled kid from the suburbs.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Came to KL on a cheap AirAsia flight from Bali. Was supposed to stay three days, but the hostel was cheap, the nightlife was good, and a German backpacker named Felix told him about easy money. Now it's been three weeks and counting.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "mate," "legend," "sick," "heaps," "reckon," "no worries," "she'll be right," "fully," "keen"
- Avoids words like: anything formal, anything that suggests planning or responsibility
- Catchphrases: "Relax, it's Asia" / "She'll be right" / "That's what travel insurance is for" / "You only live once, unless you're boring"

### Speech Pattern
- Short, confident declarations
- Drops the ends of sentences when he's being evasive
- Uses Australian slang even when no one understands it
- Talks over people, especially locals
- Laughs before delivering bad takes, as if that makes them okay

### Internal Monologue Style
Breezy, dismissive, self-congratulatory. He narrates his own life like a travel vlog. Constantly comparing current experiences to past trips ("This reminds me of that time in Laos..."). His thoughts rarely go deeper than surface-level observations. When something genuinely threatening happens, his internal voice speeds up and gets defensive, rationalizing frantically.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram (aspires to TikTok but can't figure out the algorithm)
- **Follower count:** 4,200 (tells people "about five K")
- **Posting style:** Sunset shots, hostel rooftop selfies, #digitalnomad #livingmybestlife, photos of local food he can't name, occasionally profound captions plagiarized from travel blogs
- **Last post before death:** A selfie at a Petaling Street night market stall with the caption "KL, you absolute legend" and nine hashtags

### Online vs Reality
Online: Worldly, adventurous, living the dream, inspiring others to quit their 9-5
Reality: Broke, directionless, increasingly desperate, doing favors for strangers to afford another week in a shared dorm

## Relationships

### Family
- **Parents (David and Karen Briggs):** Love him, enable him, increasingly worried. His mother calls every Sunday; he answers every third week. His father has started mentioning "when you come home" instead of "if."
- **Sister (Megan, 30):** Works as an accountant in Sydney. Resents Connor's lifestyle. They text rarely.

### Friends
- No real friends - just an ever-rotating cast of hostel acquaintances he calls "legends" for two weeks before forgetting their names. His phone contacts are 80% first names with country flags.

### Romantic
- Single. Serial hostel flings. Has a pattern of intense three-day "connections" that he mistakes for love, followed by tearful airport goodbyes and a week of Instagram stories about "the one that got away."

### At the Hostel
- **Felix Decker:** His new best mate, the cool German who always has money and connections. Connor wants to be him.
- **Priya Sharma:** The British-Indian medical student who sees through him but is drawn to his energy. She tries to warn him.
- **Jake Porter:** American party bro, Connor's drinking buddy, too dumb to be suspicious of anything.
- **Tomoko Sato:** Japanese traveler who openly distrusts Felix and by extension, Connor. He dismisses her as "uptight."

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes late, hungover. Checks phone: 3% battery, a text from Felix about "one last job," and seven Instagram notifications. Decides to skip breakfast. Puts on the same shorts from yesterday.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Standing in the hostel's rooftop terrace, looking out over the KL skyline with a coffee he didn't pay for, genuinely thinking: *This is the life. This is what people back home will never understand.* For one moment, he is purely, simply happy.

### Final Thoughts
*This isn't happening. This is a mistake. I'm Australian. They can't do this. Someone will fix this. Mum will fix this. This isn't... I didn't... I don't even know what...*

### Last Words
"I didn't know. Mate, I swear, I didn't know."
